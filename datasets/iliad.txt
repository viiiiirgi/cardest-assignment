any

first
fear
that
the

greatly
the
decline
next
those
who
have
kept
their

and
are
able

and
enjoy
the
original
will
hardly
take

mere
translation
while
the

the

not

admirable

there

some
who

attempt
have

may
recognize
some
slight

perfume
numerous

been
the

the
metres
which
have
been
selected
have
been
almost
various
the
ordinary
couplet

the
spenserian
stanza
the
trochaic
ballad
metre
all
have
had
their
partisans
even
that
pestilent
heresy
the
called
english
hexameter
metre
wholly
repugnant
the
genius

which
can
only
pressed
into
the
service
violation

which
notwithstanding
respect

never

irresistibly
reminded

but
the
progress
this
work
have
been
more
and

confirmed
the
opinion
which
expressed
its
commencement
that
whatever
may
the
extent

individual
failure
justice
ever
done
the
easy
flow
and
majestic
simplicity
the
grand
old
poet
can
only
the
heroic
blank

have
seen
isolated
passages
admirably
rendered
other
metres
and
there
are
many
instances
which
translation
line

line
and
couplet
for
couplet
naturally
suggests
itself
and
which
sometimes
difficult
avoid
involuntary
rhyme
but
the
blank
verse
appears
the
only
metre
capable
adapting
itself
all
the
gradations
may
use
the
term
the
homeric
style
from
the
finished
poetry
the
numerous
similes
which
every

this

gratifying

how
far

the

the

the

renewed
comparison

enabled

awhile
before

soon
antilochus
the

espied
was
gully
where
the

had
lain
collected
and
had
broken
through

road
and
hollow
out
the

there
menelaus
held
his
cautious
course
fearing
collision
but
antilochus
drawing
his
steeds
little
from
the
track
bore
down
upon
him
sideways
then
fear
the
son
atreus
antilochus
shouted
aloud
antilochus
thou

hold

grows
the

there
thou

here
thou

but
cause

said

then
thus
reproachful
antilochus
antilochus
thou
most
perverse

beshrew

greeks
are
much

who
give
thee

thou

his

call
aloud
slack
not

defeated
mourn
their

either
the

homer
must
here
have
fallen
into
error
for
two
complete
nights
and
one
day
that
which
patroclus
met
his
death
had
intervened
since
the
visit
ajax

ulysses
the

achilles
see
also
the
terms
made
use
this
line
and
may
appear
somewhat
coarse
addressed
one
goddess
another
but
assure
the
english
reader
that
this
passage
especially
have
greatly
softened
down
the
expression
the
original
literal
translation
which
however
forcible
would
shock
even
the
least
fastidious
critic
must
indeed
admitted
that
the
mode
which
the
white
armed
goddess
proceeds
execute
her
threat
hardly
more
dignified
than
the
language
which
conveyed
refined
line
they
being
two
while
was
only
one
such
believe
the
true
interpretation
this
passage
which
however
one
admitted
difficulty
according
our
modern
notions
not
very
evident
what
advantage
two
men
car
would
have
over
one
another
nor
what
would
gained
the
division
labour
which
assigned
the
reins
one
and
the
whip
the
other
