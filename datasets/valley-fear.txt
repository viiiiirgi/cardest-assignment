impatiently
believe
that
one
the
most
long
suffering
mortals
but
admit
that
was
annoyed
the
sardonic
interruption
really
holmes
said
severely
you

too
much
absorbed
with
his

give
any

answer
remonstrance
leaned
upon
his
hand
with
his
untasted
breakfast
before
him
and
stared
the
slip
paper
which
had
just
drawn
from
its
envelope
then
took
the
envelope
itself
held
the
light
and
very
carefully
studied
both
the
exterior
and
the
flap
porlock
writing
said
thoughtfully
can
hardly
doubt
that
porlock
writing
though
have
seen
only
twice
before
the
greek
with
the
peculiar
top
flourish
distinctive
but
porlock
then
must
something
the
very
first
importance
was
speaking
himself
rather
than
but
vexation
disappeared
the
interest
which
the
words
awakened
who
then
porlock
asked
porlock
watson
nom
plume
mere
identification
mark
but
behind
lies
shifty
and
evasive
personality
former
letter
frankly
informed
that
the
name
was
not
his
own
and
defied
ever
trace
him
among
the
teeming
millions
this
great
city
porlock
important
not
for
himself
but
for
the
great
man
with
whom
touch
picture
yourself
the
pilot
fish
with
the
shark
the
jackal
with
the
lion
anything
that
insignificant
companionship
with
what
formidable
not
only
formidable
watson
but
sinister
the
highest
degree
sinister
that
where
comes
within
purview
you
have
heard
speak
professor
moriarty
the
famous
scientific
criminal
famous
among
crooks
blushes
watson
holmes
murmured
deprecating
voice
was
about
say
unknown
the
public
touch
distinct
touch
cried
holmes
you
are
developing
certain
unexpected
vein
pawky
humour
watson
against
which
must
learn
guard
myself
but
calling
moriarty
criminal
you
are
uttering
libel
the
eyes
the
law
and
there
lie
the
glory
and
the
wonder
the
greatest
schemer
all
time
the
organizer
every
deviltry
the
controlling
brain
the
underworld
brain
which
might
have
made
marred
the
destiny
nations
that
the
man
but
aloof
from
general
suspicion
immune
from
criticism
admirable
his
management
and
self
effacement
that
for
those
very
words
that
you
have
uttered
could
hale
you
court
and
emerge
with
your
year
pension
solatium
for
his
wounded
character
not
the
celebrated
author
the
dynamics
asteroid
book
which
ascends
such
rarefied
heights
pure
mathematics
that
said
that
there
was
man
the
scientific
press
capable
criticizing
this
man
traduce
foul
mouthed
doctor
and
slandered
professor
such
would
your
respective
roles
that
genius
watson
but
spared
lesser
men
our
day
will
surely
come
may
there
see
exclaimed
devoutly
but
you
were
speaking
this
man
porlock
yes
the
called
porlock
link
the
chain
some
little
way
from
its
great
attachment
porlock
not
quite
sound
link
between
ourselves
the
only
flaw
that
chain
far
have
been
able
test
but
chain
stronger
than
its
weakest
link
exactly
dear
watson
hence
the
extreme
importance
porlock
led
some
rudimentary
aspirations
towards
right
and
encouraged
the
judicious
stimulation
occasional
ten
pound
note
sent
him
devious

has
once
twice
given

which
has
been
value
that
highest
value
which
anticipates
and
prevents
rather
than

cannot
doubt
that
had
the

should
find
that
this
communication
the
nature
that

again
holmes
flattened
out
the
paper
upon
his
unused
plate
rose
and
leaning
over
him
stared
down
the
curious
inscription
which
ran
follows
douglas

birlstone
what
you
make
holmes
obviously
attempt
convey
secret
information
but
what
the
use
cipher
message
without
the
cipher
this
instance
none
all
why
you
say
this
instance
because
there
are
many
ciphers
which
would
read
easily
the
apocrypha
the
agony
column
such
crude
devices
amuse
the
intelligence
without
fatiguing
but
this
different
clearly
reference
the
words

some
book
until
told
which
page
and
which
book
powerless
but
why
douglas
and
birlstone
clearly
because
those
are
words
which
were
not
contained
the

question
then
why
has
not
indicated
the
book
your
native
shrewdness
dear
watson
that
innate
cunning
which
the
delight
your
friends
would
surely
prevent
you
from
inclosing
cipher
and

the

should
miscarry
you

undone
both

before
any

comes
from

surprised

the
very

was
fulfilled
within

the

his

clouded
however
glanced
over
the

dear
this
very
disappointing

watson
that
all

trust
that

dear
holmes
says

fred

sat
for
some
little

twisting
this

between
his

frowning
stared
into
the
fire
after
all
said

there
may
nothing

anyhow
friend
porlock
evidently
scared
out
his

kindly
compare
the

the

upon

before
this

the

the

why

had
the
impersonal
joy
the
true

his
better
work
even
mourned
darkly
when
fell
below
the
high
level
which
aspired
was
still
chuckling
over
his
success
when
billy
swung
open
the
door
and
inspector
macdonald
scotland
yard
was
ushered
into
the
room
those
were
the
early
days
the
end
the
when
alec
macdonald
was
far
from
having
attained
the
national
fame
which
has
now
achieved
was
young
but
trusted
member
the
detective
force
who
had
distinguished
himself
several
cases
which
had
been
intrusted
him
his
tall
bony
figure
gave
promise
exceptional
physical
strength
while
his
great
cranium
and
deep
set
lustrous
eyes
spoke
less
clearly
the
keen
intelligence
which
twinkled
out
from
behind
his
bushy
eyebrows
was
silent
precise
man
with
dour
nature
and
hard
aberdonian
accent
twice
already
his
career
had
holmes
helped
him
attain
success
his
own
sole
reward
being
the
intellectual
joy
the
problem
for
this
reason
the
affection
and
respect
the
scotchman
for
his
amateur
colleague
were
profound
and
showed
them
the
frankness
with
which
consulted
holmes
every
difficulty
mediocrity
knows
nothing
higher
than
itself
but
talent
instantly
recognizes
genius
and
macdonald
had
talent
enough
for
his
profession
enable
him
perceive
that
there
was
humiliation
seeking
the
assistance
one
who
already
stood
alone
europe
both
his
gifts
and
his
experience
holmes
was
not
prone
friendship
but
was
tolerant
the
big
scotchman
and
smiled
the
sight
him
you
are
early
bird
mac
said
wish
you
luck
with
your
worm
fear
this
means
that
there
some
mischief
afoot
you
said
hope
instead
fear
would
nearer
the
truth
thinking
holmes
the
inspector
answered
with
knowing
grin
well
maybe
wee
nip
would
keep
out
the
raw
morning
chill
won

thank
you
have
pushing
way
for
the
early
hours
case
are
the
precious
ones
man
knows
better
than
your
own
self
but
but
the
inspector
had
stopped
suddenly
and
was
staring
with
look
absolute
amazement
paper
upon
the
table
was
the
sheet
upon
which
had
scrawled
the
enigmatic
message
douglas
stammered
birlstone
what
this
holmes
man
witchcraft
where
the
name
all
that
wonderful
did
you
get
those
names
cipher
that
watson
and
have
had
occasion
solve
but
why
what
amiss
with
the
names
the
inspector
looked
from
one
the
other
dazed
astonishment
just
this
said
that
douglas
birlstone
manor
house
was
horribly
murdered
last
night
chapter
sherlock
holmes
discourses
was
one
those
dramatic
moments
for
which
friend
existed
would
overstatement
say
that
was
shocked
even
excited
the
amazing
announcement
without
having
tinge
cruelty
his
singular
composition
was
undoubtedly
callous
from
long
overstimulation
yet
his
emotions
were
dulled
his
intellectual
perceptions
were
exceedingly
active
there
was
trace
then
the
horror
which
had
myself
felt
this
curt
declaration
but
his
face
showed
rather
the
quiet
and
interested
composure
the
chemist
who
sees
the
crystals
falling
into
position
from
his
oversaturated
solution
remarkable
said
remarkable
you
don
seem
surprised
interested

but
hardly
surprised
why
should
surprised
receive
anonymous
communication
from
quarter
which
know
important
warning
that
danger
threatens
certain
person
within
hour
learn
that
this
danger
has
actually
materialized
and
that
the
person
dead
interested
but
you
observe
not
surprised
few
short
sentences
explained
the
inspector
the
facts
about
the
letter
and
the
cipher
macdonald
sat
with
his
chin
his
hands
and
his
great
sandy
eyebrows
bunched
into
yellow
tangle
was
going
down
birlstone
this
morning
said
had
come
ask
you
you

but
from
what
you
say

rather

the

who
prophesied
the

only
lay

that
man
and
the
rest
will
follow

mac
but
how
you
propose
lay
your
hands
the
called
porlock
macdonald
turned
over
the
letter
which
holmes
had
handed
him
posted
camberwell
that
doesn
help
much
name
you
say
assumed
not
much
certainly
didn
you
say
that
you
have
sent
him
money
twice
and
how
notes
camberwell
post
office
did
you
ever
trouble
see
who
called
for
them
the
inspector
looked
surprised
and
little
shocked
why
not
because
always
keep
faith
had
promised
when
first
wrote
that
would
not
try
trace
him
you
think
there
someone
behind
him
know
there
this
professor
that
heard
you
mention
exactly
inspector
macdonald
smiled
and
his
eyelid
quivered
glanced
towards
won
conceal
from
you
holmes
that
think
the
that
you
have
wee
bit
bee
your
bonnet
over
this
professor
made
some
inquiries
myself
about
the
matter
seems
very
respectable
learned
and
talented
sort
man
glad
you
got
far
recognize
the
talent
man
you
can
but
recognize
after
heard
your
view
made
business
see
him
had
chat
with
him
eclipses
how
the
talk
got
that
way
canna
think
but
had
out
reflector

good
aberdeen
upbringing

made
grand
meenister
with
his
thin

and
gray

and
solemn
like

talking
when
put

was
like

blessing
before
you
out
into
the
cold
cruel
world
holmes
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
hands
great
said
great
tell
friend
macdonald
this
pleasing
and
touching
interview
was
suppose
the
professor
study
that
fine
room
not
very
fine
very
handsome
indeed
holmes
you
sat
front
his
writing
desk
just
sun
your
eyes
and
his
face
the
shadow
well
was
evening
but
mind
that
the
lamp
was
turned
face
would
did
you
happen
observe
picture
over
the
professor
head
don
miss
much
holmes
maybe
learned
that
from
you
yes
saw
the
picture
young
woman
with
her
head
her
hands
peeping
you
sideways
that
painting
was
jean
baptiste
greuze
the
inspector
endeavoured
look
interested
jean
baptiste
greuze
holmes
continued
joining
his
finger
tips
and
leaning
well
back
his
chair
was
french
artist
who
flourished
between
the
years
and
allude
course
his
working
career
modern
criticism
has
more
than
indorsed
the
high
opinion
formed
him
his
contemporaries
the
inspector
eyes
grew
abstracted
hadn
better
said
are
doing
holmes
interrupted
all
that
saying
has
very
direct
and
vital
bearing
upon
what
you
have
called
the
birlstone
mystery
fact
may
sense
called
the
very
centre
macdonald
smiled
feebly
and
looked
appealingly
your
thoughts
move
bit
too
quick
for
holmes
you
leave
out
link
two
and
can
get
over
the
gap
what
the
whole
wide
world
can
the
connection
between
this
dead
painting
man
and
the
affair
birlstone
all
knowledge
comes
useful
the
detective
remarked
holmes
even
the
trivial
fact
that
the
year
picture
greuze
entitled
jeune
fille
agneau
fetched
one
million
two
hundred
thousand
francs
more
than
forty
thousand
pounds
the
portalis
sale
may
start
train
reflection
your
mind
was
clear
that
did
the
inspector
looked
honestly
interested
may
remind
you
holmes
continued
that
the
professor
salary
can
ascertained
several
trustworthy
books
reference
seven
hundred
year
then
how
could
buy
quite
how
could
that
remarkable
said
the
inspector
thoughtfully
talk
away
holmes
just
loving
fine
holmes
smiled
was
always
warmed
genuine
admiration
the
characteristic
the
real
artist
what
about
birlstone
asked
time
yet
said
the
inspector
glancing
his
watch
cab
the
door
and
won
take
twenty
minutes
victoria
but
about
this
picture
thought
you
told
once
holmes
that
you
had
never
met
professor
moriarty
never
have
then
how
you
know
about
his
rooms
that
another
matter
have
been
three
times
his
rooms
twice
waiting
for
him
under
different
pretexts
and
leaving
before
came
once
well
can
hardly
tell
about
the
once
official
detective
was
the
last
occasion
that
took
the
liberty
running
over
his
papers
with
the
most
unexpected
results
you
found
something
compromising
absolutely
nothing
that
was
what
amazed
however
you
have
now
seen
the
point
the
picture
shows
him
very
wealthy
man
how
did
acquire
wealth
unmarried
his
younger
brother
station
master
the
west
england
his
chair
worth
seven
hundred
year
and
owns
greuze
well
surely
the
inference
plain
you
mean
that
has
great
income
and
that
must
earn
illegal
fashion
exactly
course
have
other
reasons
for
thinking
dozens
exiguous
threads
which
lead
vaguely
towards
the
centre
the
web
where
the
poisonous
motionless
creature
lurking
only
mention
the
greuze
because
brings
the
matter
within
the
range
your
own
observation
well
holmes
admit
that
what
you
say
interesting
more
than
interesting
just
wonderful
but
let
have
little
clearer
you
can
forgery
coining
burglary
where
does
the
money
come
from
have
you
ever
read
jonathan
wild
well
the
name
has
familiar
sound
someone
novel
was
not
don
take
much
stock
detectives
novels
chaps
that
things
and
never
let
you
see
how
they
them
that
just
inspiration
not
business
jonathan
wild
wasn
detective
and
wasn
novel
was
master
criminal
and
lived
last
century
thereabouts
then
use
practical
man
mac
the
most
practical
thing
that
you
ever
did
your
life
would
shut
yourself
for
three
months
and
read
twelve
hours
day
the
annals
crime
everything
comes
circles
even
professor
moriarty
jonathan
wild
was
the
hidden
force
the
london
criminals
whom
sold
his
brains
and
his
organization
fifteen
per

commission
the
old
wheel
turns
and
the
same
spoke
comes
all
been
done
before
and
will
again
tell
you
one
two
things
about
moriarty
which
may
interest
you
you
interest
right
enough
happen
know
who
the
first
link
his
chain
chain
with
this
napoleon
gone

one
end
and
hundred
broken

the
other
with
every

between
his

aloof
and
guarded
and
inaccessible
the
law
himself
what
you
think
pays
him
like
hear
six
thousand

that
paying
for
brains
you
see
the
american
business
principle
learned
that
detail
quite
chance
more
than
the
prime
minister
gets
that
gives
you
idea
moriarty
gains
and
the
scale
which
works
another
point
made
business
hunt
down
some
moriarty
checks
lately
just
common
innocent
checks
that
pays
his
household
bills
with
they
were
drawn
six
different
banks
does
that
make
any
impression
your
mind
queer
certainly
but
what
you
gather
from
that
wanted
gossip
about
his
wealth
single
man
should
know
what
had
have
doubt
that
has
twenty
banking
accounts
the
bulk
his
fortune

the
deutsche
bank
the
credit
lyonnais
likely
not
sometime
when
you
have
year
two
spare
commend
you
the
study
professor
moriarty
inspector
macdonald
had
grown
steadily
more
impressed
the
conversation
proceeded
had
lost
himself
his
interest
now
his
practical
scotch
intelligence
brought
him
back
with
snap
the
matter
hand
can
keep
anyhow
said
you
got
side
tracked
with
your
interesting
anecdotes
holmes
what
really
counts
your
remark
that
there
some
connection
between
the
professor
and
the
crime
that
you
get
from
the
warning
received
through
the
man
porlock
can
for
our
present
practical
needs
get
any
further
than
that
may
form
some
conception
the
motives
the
crime
gather
from
your
original
remarks
inexplicable
least
unexplained
murder
now
presuming
that
the
source
the
crime
suspect
there
might
two
different
motives
the
first
place
may
tell
you
that
moriarty
rules
with
rod
iron
over
his
people
his
discipline
tremendous
there
only
one
punishment
his
code
death
now
might
suppose
that
this
murdered
man
this
douglas
whose
approaching
fate
was
known
one
the
arch
criminal
subordinates
had
some
way
betrayed
the
chief
his
punishment
followed
and
would
known
all
only
put
the
fear
death
into
them
well
that
one
suggestion
holmes
the
other
that
has
been
engineered
moriarty
the
ordinary
course
business
was
there
any
robbery
have
not
heard
would
course
against
the
first
hypothesis
and
favour
the
second
moriarty
may
have
been
engaged
engineer
promise
part
spoils
may
have
been
paid
much
down
manage
either
possible
but
whichever
may
some
third
combination
down
birlstone
that
must
seek
the
solution
know
our
man
too
well
suppose
that
has
left
anything
here
which
may
lead
him
then
birlstone
must
cried
macdonald
jumping
from
his
chair
word
later
than
thought
can
give
you
gentlemen
five
minutes
for
preparation
and
that
all
and
ample
for
both
said
holmes
sprang
and
hastened
change
from
his
dressing
gown
his
coat
while
are
our
way
mac
will
ask
you
good
enough
tell
all
about
all
about
proved
disappointingly
little
and
yet
there
was
enough
assure
that
the
case
before
might
well
worthy
the
expert
closest
attention
brightened
and
rubbed
his
thin
hands
together
listened
the
meagre
but
remarkable
details
long
series
sterile
weeks
lay
behind
and
here
last
there
was
fitting
object
for
those
remarkable
powers
which
like
all
special
gifts
become
irksome
their
owner
when
they
are
not

that
razor
brain
blunted
and
rusted
with
inaction
sherlock
holmes
eyes
glistened
his
pale
cheeks
took
warmer
hue
and
his
whole
eager
face
shone
with
inward
light
when
the
call
for
work
reached
him
leaning
forward
the
cab
listened
intently
macdonald
short
sketch
the
problem
which
awaited
sussex
the
inspector
was
himself
dependent
explained
upon
scribbled
account
forwarded
him
the
milk
train
the
early
hours
the
morning
white
mason
the
local
officer
was
personal
friend
and
hence
macdonald
had
been
notified
much
more
promptly
than
usual
scotland
yard
when
provincials
need
their
assistance
very
cold
scent
upon
which
the
metropolitan
expert
generally
asked
run
dear

macdonald
said
the

for
your
private

what
train
the
morning
you
can
get
for
birlstone
and
will

met
too
occupied
this
case
snorter
don
waste
moment
getting
started
you
can
bring
holmes
please
for
will
find
something
after
his
own
heart
would
think
the
whole
had
been
fixed
for
theatrical
effect
there
wasn
dead
man
the
middle
word
snorter
your
friend
seems
fool
remarked
holmes
sir
white
mason
very
live
man
any
judge
well
have
you
anything
more
only
that
will
give
every
detail
when
meet
then
how
did
you
get
douglas
and
the
fact
that
had
been
horribly
murdered
that
was
the
inclosed
official
report
didn
say
horrible
that
not
recognized
official
term
gave
the
name
john
douglas
mentioned
that
his
injuries
had
been
the
head
from
the
discharge
shotgun
also
mentioned
the
hour
the
alarm
which
was
close
midnight
last
night
added
that
the
case
was
undoubtedly
one
murder
but
that
arrest
had
been
made
and
that
the
case
was
one
which
presented
some
very
perplexing
and
extraordinary
features
that
absolutely
all
have
present
holmes
then
with
your
permission
will
leave
that
mac
the
temptation
form
premature
theories
upon
insufficient
data
the
bane
our
profession
can
see
only
two
things
for
certain
present
great
brain
london
and
dead
man
sussex
the
chain
between
that
are
going
trace
chapter
the
tragedy
birlstone
now
for
moment
will
ask
leave
remove
own
insignificant
personality
and
describe
events
which
occurred
before
arrived
upon
the
scene
the
light
knowledge
which
came
afterwards
only
this
way
can
make
the
reader
appreciate
the
people
concerned
and
the
strange
setting
which
their
fate
was
cast
the
village
birlstone
small
and
very
ancient
cluster
half
timbered
cottages
the
northern
border
the
county
sussex
for
centuries
had
remained
unchanged
but
within
the
last
few
years
its
picturesque
appearance
and
situation
have
attracted
number
well
residents
whose
villas
peep
out
from
the
woods
around
these
woods
are
locally
supposed
the
extreme
fringe
the
great
weald
forest
which
thins
away
until
reaches
the
northern
chalk
downs
number
small
shops
have
come
into
being
meet
the
wants
the
increased
population
there
seems
some
prospect
that
birlstone
may
soon
grow
from
ancient
village
into
modern
town
the
centre
for
considerable
area

about
half
mile
from
the

standing
old

famous
for
its
huge
beech
trees
the
ancient
manor
house
birlstone
part
this
venerable
building
dates
back
the
time
the
first
crusade
when
hugo
capus
built
fortalice
the
centre
the
estate
which
had
been
granted
him
the
red
king
this
was
destroyed

and
some
its
smoke
blackened
corner
stones
were
used
when
jacobean
times
brick
country
house
rose
upon
the
ruins
the
feudal
castle
the
manor
house
with
its
many
gables
and
its
small
diamond
paned
windows
was
still
much
the
builder
had
left
the
early
seventeenth
century
the
double

which
had
guarded
its
more
warlike
predecessor
the

been
allowed

and
served

humble

though
turbid
was
never
ditchlike
unhealthy
the
ground
floor
windows
were
within
foot
the
surface
the
water
the
only
approach
the
house
was
over
drawbridge
the
chains
and
windlass
which
had
long
been
rusted
and
broken
the
latest
tenants
the
manor
house
had
however
with
characteristic
energy
set
this
right
and
the
drawbridge
was
not
only
capable
being
raised
but
actually
was
raised
every
evening
and
lowered
every
morning
thus
renewing
the
custom
the
old
feudal
days
the
manor
house
was
converted
into
island
during
the
night
fact
which
had
very
direct
bearing
upon
the
mystery
which
was
soon
engage
the
attention
all
england
the
house
had
been
untenanted
for
some
years
and
was
threatening
moulder
into
picturesque
decay
when
the
douglases
took
possession
this
family
consisted
only
two
individuals
john
douglas
and
his
wife
douglas
was
remarkable
man
both
character
and
person
age
may
have
been
about
fifty
with
strong
jawed
rugged
face
grizzling
moustache
peculiarly
keen
gray
eyes
and
wiry
vigorous
figure
which
had
lost
nothing
the
strength
and
activity
youth
was
cheery
and
genial
all
but
somewhat
offhand
his
manners
giving
the
impression
that
had
seen
life
social
strata
some
far
lower
horizon
than
the
county
society
sussex
yet
though
looked
with
some
curiosity
and
reserve
his
more
cultivated
neighbours
soon
acquired
great
popularity
among
the
villagers
subscribing
handsomely
all
local
objects
and
attending
their
smoking
concerts
and
other
functions
where
having
remarkably
rich
tenor
voice
was
always
ready
oblige
with
excellent
song
appeared
have
plenty
money
which
was
said
have
been
gained
the
california
gold
fields
and
was
clear
from
his
own
talk
and
that
his
wife
that
had
spent
part
his
life
america
the
good
impression
which
had
been
produced
his
generosity
and
his
democratic
manners
was
increased
reputation
gained
for
utter
indifference
danger
though
wretched
rider
turned
out
every
meet
and
took
the
most
amazing
falls
his
determination
hold
his
own
with
the
best
when
the
vicarage
caught
fire
distinguished
himself
also
the
fearlessness
with
which
reentered
the
building
save
property
after
the
local
fire
brigade
had
given
impossible
thus
came
about
that
john
douglas
the
manor
house
had
within
five
years
won
himself
quite
reputation
birlstone
his
wife
too
was
popular
with
those
who
had
made
her
acquaintance
though
after
the
english
fashion
the
callers
upon
stranger
who
settled
the
county
without
introductions
were
few
and
far
between
this
mattered
the
less
her
she
was
retiring
disposition
and
very
much
absorbed
all
appearance
her
husband
and
her
domestic
duties
was
known
that
she
was
english
lady
who
had
met
douglas
london
being
that
time
widower
she
was
beautiful
woman
tall
dark
and
slender
some
twenty
years
younger
than
her
husband
disparity
which
seemed
wise
mar
the
contentment
their
family
life
was
remarked
sometimes
however
those
who
knew
them
best
that
the
confidence
between
the
two
did
not
appear
complete
since
the
wife
was
either
very
reticent
about
her
husband
past
life
else
seemed
more
likely
was
imperfectly
informed
about
had
also
been
noted
and
commented
upon
few
observant
people
that
there
were
signs
sometimes
some
nerve
strain
upon
the
part
mrs
douglas
and
that
she
would
display
acute
uneasiness
her
absent
husband
should
ever
particularly
late
his
return
quiet
countryside
where
all
gossip
welcome
this
weakness
the
lady
the
manor
house
did
not
pass
without
remark
and
bulked
larger
upon
people
memory
when
the
events
arose
which
gave
very
special
significance
there
was
yet
another
individual
whose
residence
under
that
roof
was
true
only
intermittent
one
but
whose
presence
the
time
the
strange
happenings
which
will
now
narrated
brought
his
name
prominently
before
the
public
this
was
cecil
james
barker
hales
lodge
hampstead
cecil

tall
loose
jointed
figure
was
familiar

main
street
birlstone
village
for
was
frequent
and
welcome
visitor
the
manor
house
was
the
more
noticed
being
the
only
friend
the
past
unknown
life
douglas
who
was
ever
seen
his
new
english
surroundings
barker
was
himself
undoubted
englishman
but
his
remarks
was
clear
that
had
first
known
douglas
america
and
had
there
lived
intimate
terms
with
him
appeared
man
considerable
wealth
and
was
reputed
bachelor
age
was
rather
younger
than
douglas
forty
five
the
most
tall
straight
broad
chested
fellow
with
clean
shaved
prize
fighter
face
thick
strong
black
eyebrows
and
pair
masterful
black
eyes
which
might
even
without
the
aid
his
very
capable
hands
clear
way
for
him
through
hostile
crowd
neither
rode
nor
shot
but
spent
his
days
wandering
round
the
old
village
with
his
pipe
his
mouth
driving
with
his
host
his
absence
with
his
hostess
over
the
beautiful
countryside
easy
going
free
handed
gentleman
said
ames
the
butler
but
word
had
rather
not
the
man
that
crossed
him
was
cordial
and
intimate
with
douglas
and
was
less
friendly
with
his
wife
friendship
which
more
than
once
seemed
cause
some
irritation
the
husband
that
even
the
servants
were
able
perceive
his
annoyance
such
was
the
third
person
who
was
one
the
family
when
the
catastrophe
occurred
the
other
denizens
the
old
building
will
suffice
out
large
household
mention
the
prim
respectable
and
capable
ames
and
mrs
allen
buxom
and
cheerful
person
who
relieved
the
lady
some
her
household
cares
the
other
six
servants
the
house
bear
relation
the
events
the
night
january
was
eleven
forty
five
that
the
first
alarm
reached
the
small
local
police
station
charge
sergeant
wilson
the
sussex
constabulary
cecil
barker
much
excited
had
rushed
the
door
and
pealed
furiously
upon
the
bell
terrible
tragedy
had
occurred
the
manor
house
and
john
douglas
had
been
murdered
that
was
the
breathless
burden
his
message
had
hurried
back
the
house
followed
within
few
minutes
the
police
sergeant
who
arrived
the
scene
the
crime
little
after
twelve
clock
after
taking
prompt
steps
warn
the
county
authorities
that
something
serious
was
afoot
reaching
the
manor
house
the
sergeant
had
found
the
drawbridge
down
the
windows
lighted
and
the
whole
household
state
wild
confusion
and
alarm
the
white
faced
servants
were
huddling
together
the
hall
with
the
frightened
butler
wringing
his
hands
the
doorway
only
cecil
barker
seemed
master
himself
and
his
emotions
had
opened
the
door
which
was
nearest
the
entrance
and
had
beckoned
the
sergeant
follow
him
that
moment
there
arrived
wood
brisk
and
capable
general
practitioner
from
the
village
the
three
men
entered
the
fatal
room
together
while
the
horror
stricken
butler
followed
their
heels
closing
the
door
behind
him
shut
out
the
terrible
scene
from
the
maid
servants
the
dead
man
lay
his
back
sprawling
with
outstretched
limbs
the
centre
the
room
was
clad
only
pink
dressing
gown
which
covered
his
night
clothes
there
were
carpet
slippers
his
bare
feet
the
doctor
knelt
beside
him
and
held
down
the
hand
lamp
which
had
stood
the
table
one
glance
the
victim
was
enough
show
the
healer
that
his
presence
could
dispensed
with
the
man
had
been
horribly
injured
lying
across
his
chest
was
curious
weapon
shotgun
with
the
barrel
sawed
off
foot
front
the
triggers
was
clear
that
this
had
been
fired
close
range
and
that
had
received
the
whole
charge
the
face
blowing
his
head
almost
pieces
the
triggers
had
been
wired
together
make
the
simultaneous
discharge
more
destructive
the
country
policeman
was
unnerved
and
troubled
the
tremendous
responsibility
which
had
come
suddenly
upon
him
will
touch
nothing
until
superiors
arrive
said
hushed
voice
staring
horror
the
dreadful
head
nothing
has
been
touched
now
said
cecil
barker
answer
for
that
you
see
all
exactly
found
when
was
that
the
sergeant
had
drawn
out
his
notebook
was
just
half
past
eleven
had
not
begun
undress
and
was
sitting
the
fire
bedroom
when
heard
the
report
was
not
very
loud
seemed
muffled
rushed
down
don
suppose
was
thirty
seconds
before
was
the
room
was
the
door
open
yes
was
open
poor
douglas
was
lying
you
see
him
his
bedroom
candle
was
burning
the
table
was
who
lit
the
lamp
some
minutes
afterward
did
you
see
one
heard
mrs
douglas
coming
down
the
stair
behind
and
rushed
out
prevent
her
from
seeing
this
dreadful
sight
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
came
and
took
her
away
ames
had
arrived
and
ran
back
into
the
room
once
more
but
surely
have
heard
that
the
drawbridge
kept
all
night
yes
was
until
lowered
then
how
could
any
murderer
have
got
away
out
the
question
douglas
must
have
shot
himself
that
was
our
first
idea
but
see
barker
drew
aside
the
curtain
and
showed
that
the
long
diamond
paned
window
was
open
its
full
extent
and
look
this
held
the
lamp
down
and
illuminated
smudge
blood
like
the
mark
boot
sole
upon
the
wooden
sill
someone
has
stood
there
getting
out
you
mean
that
someone
waded
across
the
moat
exactly
then
you
were
the
room
within
half
minute
the
crime
must
have
been
the
water
that
very
moment
have
not
doubt
wish
heaven
that
had
rushed
the
window
but
the
curtain
screened
you
can
see
and
never
occurred
then
heard
the
step
mrs
douglas
and
could
not
let
her
enter
the
room
would
have
been
too
horrible
horrible
enough
said
the
doctor
looking
the
shattered
head
and
the
terrible
marks
which
surrounded
never
seen
such
injuries
since
the
birlstone
railway
smash
but
say
remarked
the
police
sergeant
whose
slow
bucolic
common
sense
was
still
pondering
the
open
window
all
very
well
your
saying
that
man
escaped
wading
this
moat
but
what
ask
you
how
did
ever
get
into
the
house
all
the
bridge
was
that
the
question
said
barker
what
clock
was
raised
was
nearly
six
clock
said
ames
the
butler
heard
said
the
sergeant
that
was
usually
raised
sunset
that
would
nearer
half
past
four
than
six
this
time
year
mrs
douglas
had
visitors
tea
said
ames
couldn
raise
until
they
went
then
wound
myself
then
comes
this
said
the
sergeant
anyone
came
from
outside
they
did
they
must
have
got
across
the
bridge
before
six
and
been
hiding
ever
since
until
douglas
came
into
the
room
after
eleven
that
douglas
went
round
the
house
every
night
the
last
thing
before
turned
see
that
the
lights
were
right
that
brought
him
here
the
man
was
waiting
and
shot
him
then
got
away
through
the
window
and
left
his
gun
behind
him
that
how
read
for
nothing
else
will
fit
the
facts
the
sergeant
picked
card
which
lay
beside
the
dead
man
the
floor
the
initials
and
under
them
the
number
were
rudely
scrawled
ink
upon
what
this
asked
holding
barker
looked
with
curiosity
never
noticed
before
said
the
murderer
must
have
left
behind
him
can
make
sense
that
the
sergeant
kept
turning
over
his
big
fingers
what
somebody
initials
maybe
what
have
you
got
there
wood
was
good
sized
hammer
which
had
been
lying
the
rug
front
the
fireplace
substantial
workmanlike
hammer
cecil
barker
pointed
box
brass
headed
nails
upon
the
mantelpiece
douglas
was
altering
the
pictures
yesterday
said
saw
him
myself
standing
upon
that
chair
and
fixing
the
big
picture
above
that
accounts
for
the
hammer
best
put
back
the
rug
where
found
said
the
sergeant
scratching
his
puzzled
head
his
perplexity
will
want
the
best
brains
the
force
get
the
bottom
this
thing
will
london
job
before
finished
raised
the
hand
lamp
and
walked
slowly
round
the
room
hullo
cried
excitedly
drawing
the
window
curtain
one
side
what
clock
were
those
curtains
drawn
when
the
lamps
were
lit
said
the
butler
would
shortly
after
four
someone
had
been
hiding
here
sure
enough
held
down
the
light
and
the
marks
muddy
boots
were
very
visible
the
corner
bound
say
this
bears
out
your
theory
barker
looks
the
man
got
into
the
house
after
four
when
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
before
six
when
the
bridge
was
raised
slipped
into
this
room
because
was
the
first
that
saw
there
was
other
place
where
could
hide
popped
behind
this
curtain
that
all
seems
clear
enough
likely
that
his
main
idea
was
burgle
the
house
but
douglas
chanced
come
upon
him
murdered
him
and
escaped
that
how
read
said
barker
but
say
aren
wasting
precious
time
couldn
start
out
and
scout
the
country
before
the
fellow
gets
away
the
sergeant
considered
for
moment
there
are
trains
before
six
the
morning
can
get
away
rail
goes
road
with
his
legs
all
dripping
odds
that
someone
will
notice
him
anyhow
can
leave
here
myself
until
relieved
but
think
none
you
should
until
see
more
clearly
how
all
stand
the
doctor
had
taken
the
lamp
and
was
narrowly
scrutinizing
the
body
what
this
mark
asked
could
this
have
any
connection
with
the
crime
the
dead
man
right
arm
was
thrust
out
from
his
dressing
gown
and
exposed
high
the
elbow
about
halfway
the
forearm
was
curious
brown
design
triangle
inside
circle
standing
out
vivid
relief
upon
the
lard
coloured
skin
not
tattooed
said
the
doctor
peering
through
his
glasses
never
saw
anything
like
the
man
has
been
branded
some
time
they
brand
cattle
what
the
meaning
this
don
profess
know
the
meaning
said
cecil
barker
but
have
seen
the
mark
douglas
many
times
this
last
ten
years
and
have
said
the
butler
many
time
when
the
master
has
rolled
his
sleeves
have
noticed
that
very
mark
often
wondered
what
could
then
has
nothing
with
the
crime
anyhow
said
the
sergeant
but
rum
thing
all
the
same
everything
about
this
case
rum
well
what
now
the
butler
had
given
exclamation
astonishment
and
was
pointing
the
dead
man
outstretched
hand
they
taken
his
wedding
ring
gasped
what
yes
indeed
master
always
wore
his
plain
gold
wedding
ring
the
little
finger
his
left
hand
that
ring
with
the
rough
nugget
was
above
and
the
twisted
snake
ring
the
third
finger
there
the
nugget
and
there
the
snake
but
the
wedding
ring
gone
right
said
barker
you
tell
said
the
sergeant
that
the
wedding
ring
was
below
the
other
always
then
the
murderer
whoever
was
first
took
off
this
ring
you
call
the
nugget
ring
then
the
wedding
ring
and
afterwards
put
the
nugget
ring
back
again
that
the
worthy
country
policeman
shook
his
head

the

macdonald
kept

down

when
they

done
before
they
get
poking
their

messing
all

there
has
been
nothing

this
that

there
are
some

very
bustling
and
genial
person
this

ten
minutes
had

quarters
ten

were
seated
the
parlour
the

and
being
treated
rapid
sketch
those
events
which
have
been
outlined
the
previous
chapter
macdonald
made
occasional
note
while
holmes
sat
absorbed
with
the
expression
surprised
and
reverent
admiration
with
which
the
botanist
surveys
the
rare
and
precious
bloom
remarkable
said
when
the
story
was
unfolded
most
remarkable
can
hardly
recall
any
case
where
the
features
have
been
more
peculiar
thought
you
would
say
holmes
said
white
mason
great
delight
well
with
the
times
sussex
told
you
now
how
matters
were
the
time
when
took
over
from
sergeant
wilson
between
three
and
four
this
morning
word
made
the
old
mare
but
need
not
have
been
such
hurry
turned
out
for
there
was
nothing
immediate
that
could
sergeant
wilson
had
all
the
facts
checked
them
and
considered
them
and
maybe
added
few
own
what
were
they
asked
holmes
eagerly
well
first
had
the
hammer
examined
there
was
wood
there
help
found
signs
violence
upon
was
hoping
that
douglas
defended
himself
with
the
hammer
might
have
left
his
mark
upon
the
murderer
before
dropped
the
mat
but
there
was
stain
that
course
proves
nothing
all
remarked
inspector
macdonald
there
has
been
many
hammer
murder
and
trace
the
hammer
quite
doesn
prove
wasn
used
but
there
might
have
been
stains
and
that
would
have
helped
matter
fact
there
were
none
then
examined
the
gun
they
were
buckshot
cartridges
and
sergeant
wilson
pointed
out
the
triggers
were
wired
together
that
you
pulled
the
hinder
one
both
barrels
were
discharged
whoever
fixed
that
had
made
his
mind
that
was
going
take
chances
missing
his
man
the
sawed
gun
was
not
more
than
two
foot
long
one
could
carry
easily
under
one
coat
there
was
complete
maker
name
but
the
printed

apart
from

was
done
slip
quickly
from

wade
the

get
away

understandable
that
should
out

him

there

possibly
some
small
point
which
might
suggestive
was
going
propose
holmes
but
thought
well
put
you
touch
with
all
the
facts
before
suppose
anything
should
strike
you
white
mason
looked
doubtfully
the
amateur
have
worked
with
holmes
before
said
inspector
macdonald
plays
the
game
own
idea
the
game
any
rate
said
holmes
with
smile
into
case
help
the
ends
justice
and
the
work
the
police
have
ever
separated
myself
from
the
official
force
because
they
have
first
separated
themselves
from
have
wish
ever
score
their
expense
the
same
time
white
mason
claim
the
right
work
own
way
and
give
results
own
time
complete
rather
than
stages
sure
are
honoured
your
presence
and
show
you
all
know
said
white
mason
cordially
come
along
watson
and
when
the
time
comes
all
hope
for
place
your
book
walked
down
the
quaint
village
street
with
row
pollarded
elms
each
side
just
beyond
were
two
ancient
stone
pillars
weather
stained
and
lichen
blotched
bearing
upon
their
summits
shapeless
something
which
had
once
been
the
rampant
lion
capus
birlstone
short
walk
along
the
winding
drive
with
such
sward
and
oaks
around
one
only
sees
rural
england
then
sudden
turn
and
the
long
low
jacobean
house
dingy
liver
coloured
brick
lay
before
with
old
fashioned
garden
cut
yews
each
side
approached
there
was
the
wooden
drawbridge
and
the
beautiful
broad
moat
still
and
luminous
quicksilver
the
cold
winter
sunshine
three
centuries
had
flowed
past
the
old
manor
house
centuries
births
and
homecomings
country
dances
and
the
meetings
fox
hunters
strange
that
now
its
old
age
this
dark
business
should
have
cast
its
shadow
upon
the
venerable
walls
and
yet
those
strange
peaked
roofs
and
quaint
overhung
gables
were
fitting
covering
grim
and
terrible
intrigue
looked
the
deep
set
windows
and
the
long
sweep
the
dull
coloured
water
lapped
front
felt
that
more
fitting
scene
could
set
for
such
tragedy
that
the
window
said
white
mason
that
one
the
immediate
right
the
drawbridge
open
just
was
found
last
night
looks
rather
narrow
for
man
pass
well
wasn
fat
man
anyhow
don
need
your
deductions
holmes
tell
that
but
you
could
squeeze
through
all
right
holmes
walked
the
edge
the
moat
and
looked
across
then
examined
the
stone
ledge
and
the
grass
border
beyond
had
good
look
holmes
said
white
mason
there
nothing
there
sign
that
anyone
has
landed
but
why
should
leave
any
sign
exactly
why
should
the
water
always
turbid
generally
about
this
colour
the
stream
brings
down
the
clay
how
deep
about
two
feet
each
side
and
three
the
middle
can
put
aside
all
idea
the
man
having
been
drowned
crossing
child
could
not
drowned
walked
across
the
drawbridge
and
were
admitted
quaint
gnarled
dried
person
who
was
the
butler
ames
the
poor
old
fellow
was
white
and
quivering
from
the
shock
the
village
sergeant
tall
formal
melancholy
man
still
held
his
vigil
the
room
fate
the
doctor
had
departed
anything
fresh
sergeant
wilson
asked
white
mason
sir
then
you
can
home
you
had
enough
can
send
for
you
want
you
the
butler
had
better
wait
outside
tell
him
warn
cecil
barker
mrs
douglas
and
the
housekeeper
that
may
want
word
with
them
presently
now
gentlemen
perhaps
you
will
allow
give
you
the
views
have
formed
first
and
then
you
will
able
arrive
your
own
impressed
this
country
specialist
had
solid
grip
fact
and
cool
clear
common
sense
brain
which
should
take
him
some
way
his
profession
holmes
listened
him
intently
with
sign
that
impatience
which
the
official
exponent
too
often
produced
suicide
murder
that
our
first
question
gentlemen
not
were
suicide
then
have
believe
that
this
man
began
taking
off
his
wedding
ring
and
concealing
that
then
came
down
here
his
dressing
gown
trampled
mud
into
corner
behind
the
curtain
order
give
the
idea
someone
had
waited
for
him
opened
the
window
put
blood
the
can
surely
dismiss
that
said
macdonald
think
suicide
out
the
question
then
murder
has
been
done
what
have
determine
whether
was
done
someone
outside
inside
the
house
well
let
hear
the
argument
there
are
considerable
difficulties
both
ways
and
yet
one
the
other
must
will
suppose
first
that
some
person
persons
inside
the
house
did
the
crime
they
got
this
man
down
here
time
when
everything
was
still
and
yet
one
was
asleep
they
then
did
the
deed
with
the
queerest
and
noisiest
weapon
the
world
tell
everyone
what
had
happened
weapon
that
was
never
seen
the
house
before
that
does
not
seem
very
likely
start
does
does
not
well
then
everyone
agreed
that
after
the
alarm
was
given
only
minute
the
most
had
passed
before
the
whole
household
not
cecil
barker
alone
though
claims
have
been
the
first
but
ames
and
all
them
were
the
spot
you
tell
that
that
time
the
guilty
person
managed
make
footmarks
the
corner
open
the
window
mark
the
sill
with
blood
take
the
wedding
ring
off
the
dead
man
finger
and
all
the
rest
impossible
you
put
very
clearly
said
holmes
inclined
agree
with
you
well
then
are
driven
back
the
theory
that
was
done
someone
from
outside
are
still
faced
with
some
big
difficulties
but
anyhow
they
have
ceased
impossibilities
the
man
got
into
the
house
between
four
thirty
and
six
that
say
between
dusk
and
the
time
when
the
bridge
was
raised
there
had
been
some
visitors
and
the
door
was
open
there
was
nothing
prevent
him
may
have
been
common
burglar
may
have
had
some
private
grudge
against
douglas
since
douglas
has
spent
most
his
life
america
and
this
shotgun
seems
american
weapon
would
seem
that
the
private
grudge
the
more
likely
theory
slipped
into
this
room
because
was
the
first
came
and
hid
behind
the
curtain
there
remained
until
past
eleven
night
that
time
douglas
entered
the
room
was
short
interview
there
were
any
interview
all
for
mrs
douglas
declares
that
her
husband
had
not
left
her
more
than
few
minutes
when
she
heard
the
shot
the
candle
shows
that
said
holmes
exactly
the
candle
which
was
new
one
not
burned
more
than
half
inch
must
have
placed
the
table
before
was
attacked
otherwise
course
would
have
fallen
when
fell
this
shows
that
was
not
attacked
the
instant
that
entered
the
room
when
barker
arrived
the
candle
was
lit
and
the
lamp
was
out
that
all
clear
enough
well
now
can
reconstruct
things
those
lines
douglas
enters
the
room
puts
down
the
candle
man
appears
from
behind
the
curtain
armed
with
this
gun
demands
the
wedding
ring
heaven
only
knows
why
but
must
have
been
douglas
gave
then
either
cold
blood
the
course
struggle
douglas
may
have
gripped
the
hammer
that
was
found
upon
the
mat
shot
douglas
this
horrible
way
dropped
his
gun
and
also
would
seem
this
queer
card
whatever
that
may
mean
and
made
his
escape
through
the
window
and
across
the
moat
the
very
moment
when
cecil
barker
was
discovering
the
crime
how
that
holmes
very
interesting
but
just
little
unconvincing
man
would
absolute
nonsense
wasn
that
anything
else
even
worse
cried
macdonald
somebody
killed
the
man
and
whoever
was
could
clearly
prove
you
that
should
have
done
some
other
way
what
does
mean
allowing
his
retreat
cut
off
like
that
what
does
mean
using
shotgun
when
silence
was
his
one
chance
escape
come
holmes
you
give
lead
since
you
say
white
mason
theory
unconvincing
holmes
had
sat
intently
observant
during
this
long
discussion
missing
word
that
was
said
with
his
keen
eyes
darting
right
and
left
and
his
forehead
wrinkled
with
speculation
should
like
few
more
facts
before
get
far
theory
mac
said
kneeling
down
beside
the
body
dear
these
injuries
are
really
appalling
can
have
the
butler
for
moment
ames
understand
that
you
have
often
seen
this
very
unusual
mark
branded
triangle
inside
circle
upon
douglas
forearm
frequently
sir
you
never
heard
any
speculation
what
meant
sir
must
have
caused
great
pain
when
was
inflicted
undoubtedly
burn
now
observe
ames
that
there
small
piece
plaster
the
angle
douglas
jaw
did
you
observe
that
life
yes
sir
cut
himself
shaving
yesterday
morning
did
you
ever
know
him
cut
himself
shaving
before
not
for
very
long
time
sir
suggestive
said
holmes
may
course
mere
coincidence
may
point
some
nervousness
which
would
indicate
that
had
reason
apprehend
danger
had
you
noticed
anything
unusual
his
conduct
yesterday
ames
struck
that
was
little
restless
and
excited
sir
the
attack
may
not
have
been
entirely
unexpected
seem
make
little
progress
not
perhaps
you
would
rather
the
questioning
mac
holmes
better
hands
than
mine
well
then
will
pass
this
card
rough
cardboard
have
you
any
the
sort
the
house
don
think
holmes
walked
across
the
desk
and
dabbed
little
ink
from
each
bottle

the

can
you
make
anything
the

ames
sir
nothing
what
you
think
mac
gives
the
impression
secret
society
some
sort
the
same
with
his
badge
upon
the
forearm
that
idea
too
said
white
mason
well
can
adopt
working
hypothesis
and
then
see
how
far
our
difficulties
disappear

douglas
blows
his
head
nearly
off
with
this

and
escapes
wading
the

after
leaving
card
beside
the
dead
man
which
will
when
mentioned
the
papers
tell
other
members
the
society
that
vengeance
has
been
done
that
all
hangs
together
but
why
this

all

exactly
and
why
the
missing

quite
and
why
arrest

take
for

that
since

every
constable
within
forty

has

holmes

unless
has

they
can
hardly

him
and
yet
they
have

the

and
holmes
nodded
then
perhaps
you
would
now
like
hear
the
evidence
some
the
people
the

could
use
the
dining
room
ames
please
come
yourself
first
and
tell
what
you
know
the
butler
account
was
simple
and
clear
one
and
gave
convincing
impression
sincerity
had
been
engaged
five
years
before
when
douglas
first
came
birlstone
understood
that
douglas
was
rich
gentleman
who
had
made
his
money
america
had
been
kind
and
considerate
employer
not
quite
what
ames
was
used
perhaps
but
one
can
have
everything
never
saw
any
signs
apprehension
douglas
the
contrary
was
the
most
fearless
man
had
ever
known
ordered
the
drawbridge
pulled
every
night
because
was
the
ancient
custom
the
old
house
and
liked
keep
the
old
ways
douglas
seldom
went
london
left
the
village
but
the
day
before
the
crime
had
been
shopping
tunbridge
wells
ames
had
observed
some
restlessness
and
excitement
the
part
douglas
that
day
for
had
seemed
impatient
and
irritable
which
was
unusual
with
him
had
not
gone
bed
that
night
but
was
the
pantry
the
back
the
house
putting
away
the
silver
when
heard
the
bell
ring
violently
heard
shot
but
was
hardly
possible
would
the
pantry
and
kitchens
were
the
very
back
the
house
and
there
were
several
closed
doors
and
long
passage
between
the
housekeeper
had
come
out
her
room
attracted
the
violent
ringing
the
bell
they
had
gone
the
front
the
house
together
they
reached
the
bottom
the
stairs
had
seen
mrs
douglas
coming
down
she
was
not
hurrying
did
not
seem
him
that
she
was
particularly
agitated
just
she
reached
the
bottom
the
stair
barker
had
rushed
out
the
study
had
stopped
mrs
douglas
and
begged
her
back
for
god
sake
back
your
room
cried
poor
jack
dead
you
can
nothing
for
god
sake
back
after
some
persuasion
upon
the
stairs
mrs
douglas
had
gone
back
she
did
not
scream
she
made
outcry
whatever
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
had
taken
her
upstairs
and
stayed
with
her
the
bedroom
ames
and
barker
had
then
returned
the
study
where
they
had
found
everything
exactly
the
police
had
seen
the
candle
was
not
lit
that
time
but
the
lamp
was
burning
they
had
looked
out
the
window
but
the
night
was
very
dark
and
nothing
could
seen
heard
they
had
then
rushed
out
into
the
hall
where
ames
had
turned
the
windlass
which
lowered
the
drawbridge
barker
had
then
hurried
off
get
the
police
such
its
essentials
was
the
evidence
the
butler
the
account
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
was
far
went
corroboration
that
her
fellow
servant
the
housekeeper
room
was
rather
nearer
the
front
the
house
than
the
pantry
which
ames
had
been
working
she
was
preparing
bed
when
the
loud
ringing
the
bell
had
attracted
her
attention
she
was
little
hard
hearing
perhaps
that
was
why
she
had
not
heard
the
shot
but
any
case
the
study
was
long
way
off
she
remembered
hearing
some
sound
which
she
imagined
the
slamming
door
that
was
good
deal
earlier
half
hour
least
before
the
ringing
the
bell
when
ames
ran
the
front
she
went
with
him
she
saw
barker
very
pale
and
excited
come
out
the
study
intercepted
mrs
douglas
who
was
coming
down
the
stairs
entreated
her
back
and
she
answered
him
but
what
she
said
could
not
heard
take
her
stay
with
her
had
said
mrs
allen
she
had
therefore
taken
her
the
bedroom
and
endeavoured
soothe
her
she
was
greatly
excited
trembling
all
over
but
made
other
attempt
downstairs
she
just
sat
her
dressing
gown
her
bedroom
fire
with
her
head
sunk
her
hands
mrs
allen
stayed
with
her
most
the
night
the
other
servants
they
had
all
gone
bed
and
the
alarm
did
not
reach
them
until
just
before
the
police
arrived
they
slept
the
extreme
back
the
house
and
could
not
possibly
have
heard
anything
far
the
housekeeper
could
add
nothing
cross
examination
save
lamentations
and
expressions
amazement
cecil
barker
succeeded
mrs
allen
witness
the
occurrences
the
night
before
had
very
little
add
what
had
already
told
the
police
personally
was
convinced
that
the
murderer
had
escaped
the
window
the
bloodstain
was
conclusive
his
opinion
that
point
besides
the
bridge
was
there
was
other
possible
way
escaping
could
not
explain
what
had
become
the
assassin
why
had
not
taken
his
bicycle
were
indeed
his
could
not
possibly
have
been
drowned
the
moat
which
was
place
more
than
three
feet
deep
his
own
mind
had
very
definite
theory
about
the
murder
douglas
was
reticent
man
and
there
were
some
chapters
his
life
which
never
spoke
had
emigrated
america
when
was
very
young
man
had
prospered
well
and
barker
had
first
met
him
california
where
they
had
become
partners
successful
mining
claim
place
called
benito
canyon
they
had
done
very
well
but
douglas
had
suddenly
sold
out
and
started
for
england
was
widower
that
time
barker
had
afterwards
realized
his
money
and
come
live
london
thus
they
had
renewed
their
friendship
douglas
had
given
him
the
impression
that
some
danger
was
hanging
over
his
head
and
had
always
looked
upon
his
sudden
departure
from
california
and
also
his
renting
house
quiet
place
england
being
connected
with
this
peril
imagined
that
some
secret
society
some
implacable
organization
was
douglas
track
which
would
never
rest
until
killed
him
some
remarks
his
had
given
him
this
idea
though
had
never
told
him
what
the
society
was
nor
how
had
come
offend
could
only
suppose
that
the
legend
upon
the
placard
had
some
reference
this
secret
society
how
long
were
you
with
douglas
california
asked
inspector
macdonald
five
years
altogether
was
bachelor
you
say
widower
have
you
ever
heard
where
his
first
wife
came
from
remember
his
saying
that
she
was
german
extraction
and
have
seen
her
portrait
she
was
very
beautiful
woman
she
died
typhoid
the
year
before
met
him
you
don
associate
his
past
with
any
particular
part
america
have
heard
him
talk
chicago
knew
that
city
well
and
had
worked
there
have
heard
him
talk
the
coal
and
iron
districts
had
travelled
good
deal
his
time
was
politician
had
this
secret
society
with
politics
cared
nothing
about
politics
you
have
reason
think
was
criminal
the
contrary
never
met
straighter
man
life
was
there
anything
curious
about
his
life
california
liked
best
stay
and
work
our
claim
the
mountains
would
never
where
other
men
were
could
help
that
why
first
thought
that
someone
was
after
him
then
when
left
suddenly
for
europe
made
sure
that
was
believe
that
had
warning
some
sort
within
week
his
leaving
half
dozen
men
were
inquiring
for
him
what
sort
men
well
they
were
mighty
hard
looking
crowd
they
came
the
claim
and
wanted
know
where
was
told
them
that
was
gone
europe
and
that
did
not
know
where
find
him
they
meant
him
good
was
easy
see
that
were
these
men
americans
californians
well
don
know
about
californians
they
were
americans
all
right
but
they
were
not
miners
don
know
what
they
were
and
was
very
glad
see
their
backs
that
was
six
years
ago
nearer
seven
and
then
you
were
together
five
years
california
that
this
business
dates
back
not
less
than
eleven
years
the
least
that
must
very
serious
feud
that
would
kept
with
such
earnestness
for
long
that
would
light
thing
that
would
give
rise
think
shadowed
his
whole
life
was
never
quite
out
his
mind
but
man
had
danger
hanging
over
him
and
knew
what
was
don
you
think
would
turn
the
police
for
protection
maybe
was
some
danger
that
could
not
protected
against
there
one
thing
you
should
know
always
went
about
armed
his
revolver
was
never
out
his
pocket
but
bad
luck
was
his
dressing
gown
and
had
left
the
bedroom
last
night
once
the
bridge
was
guess
thought
was
safe
should
like
these
dates
little
clearer
said
macdonald
quite
six
years
since
douglas
left
california
you
followed
him
next
year
did
you
not
that
and
had
been
married
five
years
you
must
have
returned
about
the
time
his
marriage
about
month
before
was
his
best
man
did
you
know
mrs
douglas
before
her
marriage
did
not
had
been
away
from
england
for
ten
years
but
you
have
seen
good
deal
her
since
barker
looked
sternly
the
detective
have
seen
good
deal
him
since
answered
have
seen
her
because
you
cannot
visit
man
without
knowing
his
wife
you
imagine
there
any
connection
imagine
nothing
barker
bound
make
every
inquiry
which
can
bear
upon
the
case
but
mean
offense
some
inquiries
are
offensive
barker
answered
angrily
only
the
facts
that
want
your
interest
and
everyone
interest
that
they
should
cleared
did
douglas
entirely
approve
your
friendship
with
his
wife
barker
grew
paler
and
his
great
strong
hands
were
clasped
convulsively
together
you
have
right
ask
such
questions
cried
what
has
this
with
the
matter
you
are
investigating
must
repeat
the
question
well
refuse
answer
you
can
refuse
answer
but
you
must
aware
that
your
refusal
itself
answer
for
you
would
not
refuse
you
had
not
something
conceal
barker
stood
for
moment
with
his
face
set
grimly
and
his
strong
black
eyebrows
drawn
low
intense
thought
then
looked
with
smile
well
guess
you
gentlemen
are
only
doing
your
clear
duty
after
all
and
have
right
stand
the
way
only
ask
you
not
worry
mrs
douglas
over
this
matter
for
she
has
enough
upon
her
just
now
may
tell
you
that
poor
douglas
had
just
one
fault
the
world
and
that
was
his
jealousy
was
fond
man
could
fonder
friend
and
was
devoted
his
wife
loved
come
here
and
was
forever
sending
for
and
yet
his
wife
and
talked
together
there
seemed
any
sympathy
between
kind
wave
jealousy
would
pass
over
him
and
would
off
the
handle
and
saying
the
wildest
things
moment
more
than
once
sworn
off
coming
for
that
reason
and
then
would
write
such
penitent
imploring
letters
that
just
had
but
you
can
take
from
gentlemen
was
last
word
that
man
ever
had
more
loving
faithful
wife
and
can
say
also
friend
could
more
loyal
than
was
spoken
with
fervour
and
feeling
and
yet
inspector
macdonald
could
not
dismiss
the
subject
you
are
aware
said
that
the
dead
man
wedding
ring
has
been
taken
from
his
finger
appears
said
barker
what
you
mean
appears
you
know
fact
the
man
seemed
confused
and
undecided
when
said
appears
meant
that
was
conceivable
that
had
himself
taken
off
the
ring
the
mere
fact
that
the
ring
should
absent
whoever
may
have
removed
would
suggest
anyone
mind
would
not
that
the
marriage
and
the
tragedy
were
connected
barker
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
can
profess
say
what
means
answered
but
you
mean
hint
that
could
reflect
any
way
upon
this
lady
honour
his
eyes
blazed
for
instant
and
then
with
evident
effort
got
grip
upon
his
own
emotions
well
you
are
the
wrong
track
that
all
don
know
that
anything
else
ask
you
present
said
macdonald
coldly
there
was
one
small
point
remarked
sherlock
holmes
when
you
entered
the
room
there
was
only
candle
lighted
the
table
was
there
not
yes
that
was
its
light
you
saw
that
some
terrible
incident
had
occurred
exactly
you
once
rang
for
help
yes
and
arrived
very
speedily
within
minute
and
yet
when
they
arrived
they
found
that
the
candle
was
out
and
that
the
lamp
had
been
lighted
that
seems
very
remarkable
again
barker
showed
some
signs
indecision
don
see
that
was
remarkable
holmes
answered
after
pause
the
candle
threw
very
bad
light
first
thought
was
get
better
one
the
lamp
was
the
table
lit
and
blew
out
the
candle
exactly
holmes
asked
further
question
and
barker
with
deliberate
look
from
one
the
other
which
had
seemed
something
defiance
turned
and
left
the
room
inspector
macdonald
had
sent
note
the
effect
that
would
wait
upon
mrs
douglas
her
room
but
she
had
replied
that
she
would
meet
the
dining
room
she
entered
now
tall
and
beautiful
woman
thirty
reserved
and
self
possessed
remarkable
degree
very
different
from
the
tragic
and
distracted
figure
had
pictured
true
that
her
face
was
pale
and
drawn
like
that
one
who
has
endured
great
shock
but
her
manner
was
composed
and
the
finely
moulded
hand
which
she
rested
upon
the
edge
the
table
was
steady
own
her
sad
appealing
eyes
travelled
from
one
the
other
with
curiously
inquisitive
expression
that
questioning
gaze
transformed
itself
suddenly
into
abrupt
speech
have
you
found
anything
out
yet
she
asked
was
imagination
that
there
was
undertone
fear
rather
than
hope
the
question
have
taken
every
possible
step
mrs
douglas
said
the
inspector
you
may
rest
assured
that
nothing
will
neglected
spare
money
she
said
dead
even
tone
desire
that
every
possible
effort
should
made
perhaps
you
can
tell
something
which
may
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter
fear
not
but
all
know
your
service
have
heard
from
cecil
barker
that
you
did
not
actually
see
that
you
were
never
the
room
where
the
tragedy
occurred
turned
back
upon
the
stairs
begged
return
room
quite
you
had
heard
the
shot
and
you
had
once
come
down
put
dressing
gown
and
then
came
down
how
long
was
after
hearing
the
shot
that
you
were
stopped
the
stair
barker
may
have
been
couple
minutes
hard
reckon
time
such
moment
implored
not
assured
that
could
nothing
then
mrs
allen
the
housekeeper
led
upstairs
again
was
all
like
some
dreadful
dream
can
you
give
any
idea
how
long
your
husband
had
been
downstairs
before
you
heard
the
shot
cannot
say
went
from
his
dressing
room
and
did
not
hear
him
did
the
round
the
house
every
night
for
was
nervous
fire
the
only
thing
that
have
ever
known
him
nervous
that
just
the
point
which
want
come
mrs
douglas
you
have
known
your
husband
only
england
have
you
not
yes
have
been
married
five
years
have
you
heard
him
speak
anything
which
occurred
america
and
might
bring
some
danger
upon
him
mrs
douglas
thought
earnestly
before
she
answered
yes
she
said
last
have
always
felt
that
there
was
danger
hanging
over
him
refused
discuss
with
was
not
from
want
confidence
there
was
the
most
complete
love
and
confidence
between
but
was
out
his
desire
keep
all
alarm
away
from
thought
should
brood
over
knew
all
and
was
silent
how
did
you
know
then
mrs
douglas
face
lit
with
quick
smile
can
husband
ever
carry
about
secret
all
his
life
and
woman
who
loves
him
have
suspicion
knew
his
refusal
talk
about
some
episodes
his
american
life
knew
certain
precautions
took
knew
certain
words
let
fall
knew
the
way
looked
unexpected
strangers
was
perfectly
certain
that
had
some
powerful
enemies
that
believed
they
were
his
track
and
that
was
always
his
guard
against
them
was
sure
that
for
years
have
been
terrified
ever
came
home
later
than
was
expected
might
ask
asked
holmes
what
the
words
were
which
attracted
your
attention
the
valley
fear
the
lady
answered
that
was
expression
has
used
when
questioned
him
have
been
the
valley
fear
not
out
yet
are
never
get
out
the
valley
fear
have
asked
him
when
have
seen
him
more
serious
than
usual
sometimes
think
that
never
shall
has
answered
surely
you
asked
him
what
meant
the
valley
fear
did
but
his
face
would
become
very
grave
and
would
shake
his
head
bad
enough
that
one
should
have
been
its
shadow
said
please
god
shall
never
fall
upon
you
was
some
real
valley
which
had
lived
and
which
something
terrible
had
occurred
him
that
certain
but
can
tell
you
more
and
never
mentioned
any
names
yes
was
delirious
with
fever
once
when
had
his
hunting
accident
three
years
ago
then
remember
that
there
was
name
that
came
continually
his
lips
spoke
with
anger
and
sort
horror
mcginty
was
the
name
bodymaster
mcginty
asked
him
when
recovered
who
bodymaster
mcginty
was
and
whose
body
was
master
never
mine
thank
god
answered
with
laugh
and
that
was
all
could
get
from
him
but
there
connection
between
bodymaster
mcginty
and
the
valley
fear
there
one
other
point
said
inspector
macdonald
you
met
douglas
boarding
house
london
did
you
not
and
became
engaged
him
there
was
there
any
romance
anything
secret
mysterious
about
the
wedding
there
was
romance
there
always
romance
there
was
nothing
mysterious
had
rival
was
quite
free
you
have
heard
doubt
that
his
wedding
ring
has
been
taken
does
that
suggest
anything
you
suppose
that
some
enemy
his
old
life
had
tracked
him
down
and
committed
this
crime
what
possible
reason
could
have
for
taking
his
wedding
ring
for
instant
could
have
sworn
that
the
faintest
shadow
smile
flickered
over
the
woman
lips
really
cannot
tell
she
answered
certainly
most
extraordinary
thing
well
will
not
detain
you
any
longer
and
are
sorry
have
put
you
this
trouble
such
time
said
the
inspector
there
are
some
other
points
doubt
but
can
refer
you
they
arise
she
rose
and
was
again
conscious
that
quick
questioning
glance
with
which
she
had
just
surveyed
what
impression
has
evidence
made
upon
you
the
question
might
well
have
been
spoken
then
with
bow
she
swept
from
the
room
she
beautiful
woman
very
beautiful
woman
said
macdonald
thoughtfully
after
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
this
man
barker
has
certainly
been
down
here
good
deal
man
who
might
attractive
woman
admits
that
the
dead
man
was
jealous
and
maybe
knew
best
himself
what
cause
had
for
jealousy
then
there
that
wedding
ring
you
can
get
past
that
the
man
who
tears
wedding
ring
off
dead
man
what
you
say
holmes
friend
had
sat
with
his
head
upon
his
hands
sunk
the
deepest
thought
now
rose
and
rang
the
bell
ames
said
when
the
butler
entered
where
cecil
barker
now
see
sir
came
back
moment
say
that
barker
was
the
garden
can
you
remember
ames
what
barker
had
his
feet
last
night
when
you
joined
him
the
study
yes
holmes
had
pair
bedroom
slippers
brought
him
his
boots
when
went
for
the
police
where
are
the
slippers
now
they
are
still
under
the
chair
the
hall
very
good
ames
course
important
for
know
which
tracks
may
barker
and
which
from
outside
yes
sir
may
say
that
noticed
that
the
slippers
were
stained
with
blood
indeed
were
own
that
natural
enough
considering
the
condition
the
room
very
good
ames
will
ring
want
you
few
minutes
later
were
the
study
holmes
had
brought
with
him
the
carpet
slippers
from
the
hall
ames
had
observed
the
soles
both
were
dark
with
blood
strange
murmured
holmes
stood
the
light
the
window
and
examined
them
minutely
very
strange
indeed
stooping
with
one
his
quick
feline
pounces
placed
the
slipper
upon
the
blood
mark
the
sill
exactly
corresponded
smiled
silence
his
colleagues
the
inspector
was
transfigured
with
excitement
his
native
accent
rattled
like
stick
upon
railings
man
cried
there
not
doubt
barker
has
just
marked
the
window
himself
good
deal
broader
than
any
bootmark
mind
that
you
said
was
splay
foot
and
here
the
explanation
but
what
the
game
holmes
what
the
game
what
the
game
friend
repeated
thoughtfully
white
mason
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
fat
hands
together
his
professional
satisfaction
said
was
snorter
cried
and
real
snorter
chapter
dawning
light
the
three
detectives
had
many
matters
detail
into
which
inquire
returned
alone
our
modest
quarters
the
village
inn
but
before
doing
took
stroll
the
curious
old
world
garden
which
flanked
the
house
rows
very
ancient
yew
trees
cut
into
strange
designs
girded
round
inside
was
beautiful
stretch
lawn
with
old
sundial
the
middle
the
whole
effect
soothing
and
restful
that
was
welcome
somewhat
jangled
nerves
that
deeply
peaceful
atmosphere
one
could
forget
remember
only
some
fantastic
nightmare
that
darkened
study
with
the
sprawling
bloodstained
figure
the
floor
and
yet
strolled
round
and
tried
steep
soul
its
gentle
balm
strange
incident
occurred
which
brought
back
the
tragedy
and
left
sinister
impression
mind
have
said
that
decoration
yew
trees
circled
the
garden
the
end
farthest
from
the
house
they
thickened
into
continuous
hedge
the
other
side
this
hedge
concealed
from
the
eyes
anyone
approaching
from
the
direction
the
house
there
was
stone
seat
approached
the
spot
was
aware
voices
some
remark
the
deep
tones
man
answered
little
ripple
feminine
laughter
instant
later
had
come
round
the
end
the
hedge
and
eyes
lit
upon
mrs
douglas
and
the
man
barker
before
they
were
aware
presence
her
appearance
gave
shock
the
dining
room
she
had
been
demure
and
discreet
now
all
pretense
grief
had
passed
away
from
her
her
eyes
shone
with
the
joy
living
and
her
face
still
quivered
with
amusement
some
remark
her
companion
sat
forward
his
hands
clasped
and
his
forearms
his
knees
with
answering
smile
upon
his
bold
handsome
face
instant
but
was
just
one
instant
too
late
they
resumed
their
solemn
masks
figure
came
into
view
hurried
word
two
passed
between
them
and
then
barker
rose
and
came
towards
excuse
sir
said
but
addressing
watson
bowed
with
coldness
which
showed
dare
say
very
plainly
the
impression
which
had
been
produced
upon
mind
thought
that
was
probably
you
your
friendship
with
sherlock
holmes
well
known
would
you
mind
coming
over
and
speaking
mrs
douglas
for
one
instant
followed
him
with
dour
face
very
clearly
could
see
mind
eye
that
shattered
figure
the
floor
here
within
few
hours
the
tragedy
were
his
wife
and
his
nearest
friend
laughing
together
behind
bush
the
garden
which
had
been
his
greeted
the
lady
with
reserve
had
grieved
with
her
grief
the
dining
room
now
met
her
appealing
gaze
with
unresponsive
eye
fear
that
you
think
callous
and
hard
hearted
said
she
shrugged
shoulders
business
mine
said
perhaps
some
day
you
will
justice
you
only
realized
there
need
why
watson
should
realize
said
barker
quickly
has
himself
said
possible
business
his
exactly
said
and
will
beg
leave
resume
walk
one
moment
watson
cried
the
woman
pleading
voice
there
one
question
which
you
can
answer
with
more
authority
than
anyone
else
the
world
and
may
make
very
great
difference
you
know
holmes
and
his
relations
with
the
police
better
than
anyone
else
can
supposing
that
matter
were
brought
confidentially
his
knowledge
absolutely
necessary
that
should
pass
the
detectives
yes
that
said
barker
eagerly
his
own
entirely
with
them
really
don
know
that
should
justified
discussing
such
point
beg
implore
that
you
will
watson
assure
you
that
you
will
helping
helping
greatly
you
will
guide
that
point
there
was
such
ring
sincerity
the
woman
voice
that
for
the
instant
forgot
all
about
her
levity
and
was
moved
only
her
will
holmes
independent
investigator
said
his
own
master
and
would
act
his
own
judgment
directed
the
same
time
would
naturally
feel
loyalty
towards
the
officials
who
were
working
the
same
case
and
would
not
conceal
from
them
anything
which
would
help
them
bringing
criminal
justice
beyond
this
can
say
nothing
and
would
refer
you
holmes
himself
you
wanted
fuller
information
saying
raised
hat
and
went
upon
way
leaving
them
still
seated
behind
that
concealing
hedge
looked
back
rounded
the
far
end
and
saw
that
they
were
still
talking
very
earnestly
together
and
they
were
gazing
after
was
clear
that
was
our
interview
that
was
the
subject
their
debate
wish
none
their
confidences
said
holmes
when
reported
him
what
had
occurred
had
spent
the
whole
afternoon
the
manor
house
consultation
with
his
two
colleagues
and
returned
about
five
with
ravenous
appetite
for
high
tea
which
had
ordered
for
him
confidences
watson
for
they
are
mighty
awkward
comes
arrest
for
conspiracy
and
murder
you
think
will
come
that
was
his
most
cheerful
and
debonair
humour
dear
watson
when
have
exterminated
that
fourth
egg
shall
ready
put
you
touch
with
the
whole
situation
don
say
that
have
fathomed
far
from
but
when
have
traced
the
missing
dumb
bell
the
dumb
bell
dear
watson
possible
that
you
have
not
penetrated
the
fact
that
the
case
hangs
upon
the
missing
dumb
bell
well
well
you
need
not
downcast
for
between
ourselves
don
think
that
either
inspector
mac
the
excellent
local
practitioner
has
grasped
the
overwhelming
importance
this
incident
one
dumb
bell
watson
consider
athlete
with
one
dumb
bell
picture
yourself
the
unilateral
development
the
imminent
danger
spinal
curvature
shocking
watson
shocking
sat
with
his
mouth
full
toast
and
his
eyes
sparkling
with
mischief
watching
intellectual
entanglement
the
mere
sight
his
excellent
appetite
was
assurance
success
for
had
very
clear
recollections
days
and
nights
without
thought
food
when
his
baffled
mind
had
chafed
before
some
problem
while
his
thin
eager
features
became
more
attenuated
with
the
asceticism
complete
mental
concentration
finally
lit
his
pipe
and
sitting
the
inglenook
the
old
village
inn
talked
slowly
and
random
about
his
case
rather
one
who
thinks
aloud
than
one
who
makes
considered
statement
lie
watson
great
big
thumping
obtrusive
uncompromising
lie
that
what
meets
the
threshold
there
our
starting
point
the
whole
story
told
barker
lie
but
barker
story
corroborated
mrs
douglas
therefore
she
lying
also
they
are
both
lying
and
conspiracy
now
have
the
clear
problem
why
are
they
lying
and
what
the
truth
which
they
are
trying
hard
conceal
let
try
watson
you
and
can
get
behind
the
lie
and
reconstruct
the
truth
how
know
that
they
are
lying
because
clumsy
fabrication
which
simply
could
not
true
consider
according
the
story
given
the
assassin
had
less
than
minute
after
the
murder
had
been
committed
take
that
ring
which
was
under
another
ring
from
the
dead
man
finger
replace
the
other
ring
thing
which
would
surely
never
have
done
and
put
that
singular
card
beside
his
victim
say
that
this
was
obviously
impossible
you
may
argue
but
have
too
much
respect
for
your
judgment
watson
think
that
you
will
that
the
ring
may
have
been
taken
before
the
man
was
killed
the
fact
that
the
candle
had
been
lit
only
short
time
shows
that
there
had
been
lengthy
interview
was
douglas
from
what
hear
his
fearless
character
man
who
would
likely
give
his
wedding
ring
such
short
notice
could
conceive
his
giving
all
watson
the
assassin
was
alone
with
the
dead
man
for
some
time
with
the
lamp
lit
that
have
doubt
all
but
the
gunshot
was
apparently
the
cause
death
therefore
the
shot
must
have
been
fired
some
time
earlier
than
are
told
but
there
could
mistake
about
such
matter
that
are
the
presence
therefore
deliberate
conspiracy
upon
the
part
the
two
people
who
heard
the
gunshot
the
man
barker
and
the
woman
douglas
when
the
top
this
able
show
that
the
blood
mark
the
windowsill
was
deliberately
placed
there
barker
order
give
false
clue
the
police
you
will
admit
that
the
case
grows
dark
against
him
now
have
ask
ourselves
what
hour
the
murder
actually
did
occur
half
past
ten
the
servants
were
moving
about
the
house
was
certainly
not
before
that
time
quarter
eleven
they
had
all
gone
their
rooms
with
the
exception
ames
who
was
the
pantry
have
been
trying
some
experiments
after
you
left
this
afternoon
and
find
that
noise
which
macdonald
can
make
the
study
can
penetrate
the
pantry
when
the
doors
are
all
shut
otherwise
however
from
the
housekeeper
room
not
far
down
the
corridor
and
from
could
vaguely
hear
voice
when
was
very
loudly
raised
the
sound
from
shotgun
some
extent
muffled
when
the
discharge
very
close
range
undoubtedly
was
this
instance
would
not
very
loud
and
yet
the
silence
the
night
should
have
easily
penetrated
mrs
allen
room
she
she
has
told
somewhat
deaf
but
none
the
less
she
mentioned
her
evidence
that
she
did
hear
something
like
door
slamming
half
hour
before
the
alarm
was
given
half
hour
before
the
alarm
was
given
would
quarter
eleven
have
doubt
that
what
she
heard
was
the
report
the
gun
and
that
this
was
the
real
instant
the
murder
this
have
now
determine
what
barker
and
mrs
douglas
presuming
that
they
are
not
the
actual
murderers
could
have
been
doing
from
quarter
eleven
when
the
sound
the
shot
brought
them
down
until
quarter
past
eleven
when
they
rang
the
bell
and
summoned
the
servants
what
were
they
doing
and
why
did
they
not
instantly
give
the
alarm
that
the
question
which
faces
and
when
has
been
answered
shall
surely
have
gone
some
way
solve
our
problem
convinced
myself
said
that
there
understanding
between
those
two
people
she
must
heartless
creature
sit
laughing
some
jest
within
few
hours
her
husband
murder
exactly
she
does
not
shine
wife
even
her
own
account
what
occurred
not
whole
souled
admirer
womankind
you
are
aware
watson
but
experience
life
has
taught
that
there
are
few
wives
having
any
regard
for
their
husbands
who
would
let
any
man
spoken
word
stand
between
them
and
that
husband
dead
body
should
ever
marry
watson
should
hope
inspire
wife
with
some
feeling
which
would
prevent
her
from
being
walked
off
housekeeper
when
corpse
was
lying
within
few
yards
her
was
badly
stage
managed
for
even
the
rawest
investigators
must
struck
the
absence
the
usual
feminine
ululation
there
had
been
nothing
else
this
incident
alone
would
have
suggested
prearranged
conspiracy
mind
you
think
then
definitely
that
barker
and
mrs
douglas
are
guilty
the
murder
there
appalling
directness
about
your
questions
watson
said
holmes
shaking
his
pipe
they
come
like
bullets
you
put
that
mrs
douglas
and
barker
know
the
truth
about
the
murder
and
are
conspiring
conceal
then
can
give
you
whole
souled
answer
sure
they
but
your
more
deadly
proposition
not
clear
let
for
moment
consider
the
difficulties
which
stand
the
way
will
suppose
that
this
couple
are
united
the
bonds
guilty
love
and
that
they
have
determined
get
rid
the
man
who
stands
between
them
large
supposition
for
discreet
inquiry
among
servants
and
others
has
failed
corroborate
any
way
the
contrary
there
good
deal
evidence
that
the
douglases
were
very
attached
each
other
that
sure
cannot
true
said
thinking
the
beautiful
smiling
face
the
garden
well
least
they
gave
that
impression
however
will
suppose
that
they
are
extraordinarily
astute
couple
who
deceive
everyone
upon
this
point
and
conspire
murder
the
husband
happens
man
over
whose
head
some
danger
hangs
have
only
their
word
for
that
holmes
looked
thoughtful
see
watson
you
are
sketching
out
theory
which
everything
they
say
from
the
beginning
false
according
your
idea
there
was
never
any
hidden
menace
secret
society
valley
fear
boss
macsomebody
anything
else
well
that
good
sweeping
generalization
let
see
what
that
brings
they
invent
this
theory
account
for
the
crime
they
then
play
the
idea
leaving
this
bicycle
the
park
proof
the
existence
some
outsider
the
stain
the
windowsill
conveys
the
same
idea
does
the
card
the
body
which
might
have
been
prepared
the
house
that
all
fits
into
your
hypothesis
watson
but
now
come
the
nasty
angular
uncompromising
bits
which
won
slip
into
their
places
why
cut
off
shotgun
all
weapons
and
american
one
that
how
could
they
sure
that
the
sound
would
not
bring
someone
them
mere
chance
that
mrs
allen
did
not
start
out
inquire
for
the
slamming
door
why
did
your
guilty
couple
all
this
watson
confess
that
can
explain
then
again
woman
and
her
lover
conspire
murder
husband
are
they
going
advertise
their
guilt
ostentatiously
removing
his
wedding
ring
after
his
death
does
that
strike
you
very
probable
watson
does
not
and
once
again
the
thought
leaving
bicycle
concealed
outside
had
occurred
you
would
really
have
seemed
worth
doing
when
the
dullest
detective
would
naturally
say
this
obvious
blind
the
bicycle
the
first
thing
which
the
fugitive
needed
order
make
his
escape
can
conceive
explanation
and
yet
there
should
combination
events
for
which
the
wit
man
cannot
conceive
explanation
simply
mental
exercise
without
any
assertion
that
true
let
indicate
possible
line
thought
admit
mere
imagination
but
how
often
imagination
the
mother
truth
will
suppose
that
there
was
guilty
secret
really
shameful
secret
the
life
this
man
douglas
this
leads
his
murder
someone
who
will
suppose
avenger
someone
from
outside
this
avenger
for
some
reason
which
confess
still
loss
explain
took
the
dead
man
wedding
ring
the
vendetta
might
conceivably
date
back
the
man
first
marriage
and
the
ring
taken
for
some
such
reason
before
this
avenger
got
away
barker
and
the
wife
had
reached
the
room
the
assassin
convinced
them
that
any
attempt
arrest
him
would
lead
the
publication
some
hideous
scandal
they
were
converted
this
idea
and
preferred
let
him
for
this
purpose
they
probably
lowered
the
bridge
which
can
done
quite
noiselessly
and
then
raised
again
made
his
escape
and
for
some
reason
thought
that
could
more
safely
foot
than
the
bicycle
therefore
left
his
machine
where
would
not
discovered
until
had
got
safely
away
far
are
within
the
bounds
possibility
are
not
well
possible
doubt
said
with
some
reserve
have
remember
watson
that
whatever
occurred
certainly
something
very
extraordinary
well
now
continue
our
supposititious
case
the
couple
not
necessarily
guilty
couple
realize
after
the
murderer
gone
that
they
have
placed
themselves
position
which
may
difficult
for
them
prove
that
they
did
not
themselves
either
the
deed
connive
they
rapidly
and
rather
clumsily
met
the
situation
the
mark
was
put
barker
bloodstained
slipper
upon
the
windowsill
suggest
how
the
fugitive
got
away
they
obviously
were
the
two
who
must
have
heard
the
sound
the
gun
they
gave
the
alarm
exactly
they
would
have
done
but
good
half
hour
after
the
event
and
how
you
propose
prove
all
this
well
there
were
outsider
may
traced
and
taken
that
would
the
most
effective
all
proofs
but
not
well
the
resources
science
are
far
from
being
exhausted
think
that
evening
alone
that
study
would
help
much
evening
alone
propose
there
presently
have
arranged
with
the
estimable
ames
who
means
wholehearted
about
barker
shall
sit
that
room
and
see
its
atmosphere
brings
inspiration
believer
the
genius
loci
you
smile
friend
watson
well
shall
see
the
way
you
have
that
big
umbrella
yours
have
you
not
here
well
borrow
that
may
certainly
but
what
wretched
weapon
there
danger
nothing
serious
dear
watson
should
certainly
ask
for
your
assistance
but
take
the
umbrella
present
only
awaiting
the
return
our
colleagues
from
tunbridge
wells
where
they
are
present
engaged
trying
for
likely
owner
the
bicycle
was
nightfall
before
inspector
macdonald
and
white
mason
came
back
from
their
expedition
and
they
arrived
exultant
reporting
great
advance
our
investigation
man
admeet
that
had
doubts
there
was
ever
outsider
said
macdonald
but
that
all
past
now
had
the
bicycle
identified
and
have
description
our
man
that
long
step
our
journey
sounds
like
the
beginning
the
end
said
holmes
sure
congratulate
you
both
with
all
heart
well
started
from
the
fact
that
douglas
had
seemed
disturbed
since
the
day
before
when
had
been
tunbridge
wells
was
tunbridge
wells
then
that
had
become
conscious
some
danger
was
clear
therefore
that
man
had
come
over
with
bicycle
was
from
tunbridge
wells
that
might
expected
have
come
took
the
bicycle
over
with
and
showed
the
hotels
was
identified
once
the
manager
the
eagle
commercial
belonging
man
named
hargrave
who
had
taken
room
there
two
days
before
this
bicycle
and
small
valise
were
his
whole
belongings
had
registered
his
name
coming
from
london
but
had
given
address
the
valise
was
london
made
and
the
contents
were
british
but
the
man
himself
was
undoubtedly
american
well
well
said
holmes
gleefully
you
have
indeed
done
some
solid
work
while
have
been
sitting
spinning
theories
with
friend
lesson
being
practical
mac
just
that
holmes
said
the
inspector
with
satisfaction
but
this
may
all
fit
with
your
theories
remarked
that
may
may
not
but
let
hear
the
end
mac
was
there
nothing
identify
this
man
little
that
was
evident
that
had
carefully
guarded
himself
against
identification
there
were
papers
letters
and
marking
upon
the
clothes
cycle
map
the
county
lay
his
bedroom
table
had
left
the
hotel
after
breakfast
yesterday
morning
his
bicycle
and
more
was
heard
him
until
our
inquiries
that
what
puzzles
holmes
said
white
mason
the
fellow
did
not
want
the
hue
and
cry
raised
over
him
one
would
imagine
that
would
have
returned
and
remained
the
hotel
inoffensive
tourist
must
know
that
will
reported
the
police
the
hotel
manager
and
that
his
disappearance
will
connected
with
the
murder
one
would
imagine
still
has
been
justified
his
wisdom
date
any
rate
since
has
not
been
taken
but
his
description
what
that
macdonald
referred
his
notebook
here
have
far
they
could
give
they
don
seem
have
taken
any
very
particular
stock
him
but
still
the
porter
the
clerk
and
the
chambermaid
are
all
agreed
that
this
about
covers
the
points
was
man
about
five
foot
nine
height
fifty
years
age
his
hair
slightly
grizzled
grayish
moustache
curved
nose
and
face
which
all
them
described
fierce
and
forbidding
well
bar
the
expression
that
might
almost
description
douglas
himself
said
holmes
just
over
fifty
with
grizzled
hair
and
moustache
and
about
the
same
height
did
you
get
anything
else
was
dressed
heavy
gray
suit
with
reefer
jacket
and
wore
short
yellow
overcoat
and
soft
cap
what
about
the
shotgun
less
than
two
feet
long
could
very
well
have
fitted
into
his
valise
could
have
carried
inside
his
overcoat
without
difficulty
and
how
you
consider
that
all
this
bears
upon
the
general
case
well
holmes
said
macdonald
when
have
got
our
man
and
you
may
sure
that
had
his
description
the
wires
within
five
minutes
hearing
shall
better
able
judge
but
even
stands
have
surely
gone
long
way
know
that
american
calling
himself
hargrave
came
tunbridge
wells
two
days
ago
with
bicycle
and
valise
the
latter
was
sawed
off
shotgun
came
with
the
deliberate
purpose
crime
yesterday
morning
set
off
for
this
place
his
bicycle
with
his
gun
concealed
his
overcoat
one
saw
him
arrive
far
can
learn
but
need
not
pass
through
the
village
reach
the
park
gates
and
there
are
many
cyclists
upon
the
road
presumably
once
concealed
his
cycle
among
the
laurels
where
was
found
and
possibly
lurked
there
himself
with
his
eye
the
house
waiting
for
douglas
come
out
the
shotgun
strange
weapon
use
inside
house
but
had
intended
use
outside
and
there
has
very
obvious
advantages
would
impossible
miss
with
and
the
sound
shots
common
english
sporting
neighbourhood
that
particular
notice
would
taken
that
all
very
clear
said
holmes
well
douglas
did
not
appear
what
was
next
left
his
bicycle
and
approached
the
house
the
twilight
found
the
bridge
down
and
one
about
took
his
chance
intending
doubt
make
some
excuse
met
anyone
met
one
slipped
into
the
first
room
that
saw
and
concealed
himself
behind
the
curtain
thence
could
see
the
drawbridge
and
knew
that
his
only
escape
was
through
the
moat
waited
until
quarter
past
eleven
when
douglas
upon
his
usual
nightly
round
came
into
the
room
shot
him
and
escaped
arranged
was
aware
that
the
bicycle
would
described
the
hotel
people
and
clue
against
him
left
there
and
made
his
way
some
other
means
london
some
safe
hiding
place
which
had
already
arranged
how
that
holmes
well
mac
very
good
and
very
clear
far
goes
that
your
end
the
story
end
that
the
crime
was
committed
half
hour
earlier
than
reported
that
mrs
douglas
and
barker
are
both
conspiracy
conceal
something
that
they
aided
the
murderer
escape
least
that
they
reached
the
room
before
escaped
and
that
they
fabricated
evidence
his
escape
through
the
window
whereas
all
probability
they
had
themselves
let
him
lowering
the
bridge
that
reading
the
first
half
the
two
detectives
shook
their
heads
well
holmes
this
true
only
tumble
out
one
mystery
into
another
said
the
london
inspector
and
some
ways
worse
one
added
white
mason
the
lady
has
never
been
america
all
her
life
what
possible
connection
could
she
have
with
american
assassin
which
would
cause
her
shelter
him
freely
admit
the
difficulties
said
holmes
propose
make
little
investigation
own
night
and
just
possible
that
may
contribute
something
the
common
cause
can
help
you
holmes
darkness
and
watson
umbrella
wants
are
simple
and
ames
the
faithful
ames
doubt
will
stretch
point
for
all
lines
thought
lead
back
invariably
the
one
basic
question
why
should
athletic
man
develop
his
frame
upon
unnatural
instrument
single
dumb
bell
was
late
that
night
when
holmes
returned
from
his
solitary
excursion
slept
double
bedded
room
which
was
the
best
that
the
little
country
inn
could
for
was
already
asleep
when
was
partly
awakened
his
entrance
well
holmes
murmured
have
you
found
anything
out
stood
beside
silence
his
candle
his
hand
then
the
tall
lean
figure
inclined
towards
say
watson
whispered
would
you
afraid
sleep
the
same
room
with
lunatic
man
with
softening
the
brain
idiot
whose
mind
has
lost
its
grip
not
the
least
answered
astonishment
that
lucky
said
and
not
another
word
would
utter
that
night
chapter
the
solution
next
morning
after
breakfast
found
inspector
macdonald
and
white
mason
seated
close
consultation
the
small
parlour
the
local
police
sergeant
the
table
front
them
were
piled
number
letters
and
telegrams
which
they
were
carefully
sorting
and
docketing
three
had
been
placed
one
side
still
the
track
the
elusive
bicyclist
holmes
asked
cheerfully
what
the
latest
news
the
ruffian
macdonald
pointed
ruefully
his
heap
correspondence
present
reported
from
leicester
nottingham
southampton
derby
east
ham
richmond
and
fourteen
other
places
three
them
east
ham
leicester
and
liverpool
there
clear
case
against
him
and
has
actually
been
arrested
the
country
seems
full
the
fugitives
with
yellow
coats
dear
said
holmes
sympathetically
now
mac
and
you
white
mason
wish
give
you
very
earnest
piece
advice
when
went
into
this
case
with
you
bargained
you
will
doubt
remember
that
should
not
present
you
with
half
proved
theories
but
that
should
retain
and
work
out
own
ideas
until
had
satisfied
myself
that
they
were
correct
for
this
reason
not
the
present
moment
telling
you
all
that
mind
the
other
hand
said
that
would
play
the
game
fairly
you
and
not
think
fair
game
allow
you
for
one
unnecessary
moment
waste
your
energies
upon
profitless
task
therefore
here
advise
you
this
morning
and
advice
you
summed
three
words
abandon
the
case
macdonald
and
white
mason
stared
amazement
their
celebrated
colleague
you
consider
hopeless
cried
the
inspector
consider
your
case
hopeless
not
consider
that
hopeless
arrive
the
truth
but
this
cyclist
not
invention
have
his
description
his
valise
his
bicycle
the
fellow
must
somewhere
why
should
not
get
him
yes
yes
doubt
somewhere
and
doubt
shall
get
him
but
would
not
have
you
waste
your
energies
east
ham
liverpool
sure
that
can
find
some
shorter
cut
result
you
are
holding
something
back
hardly
fair
you
holmes
the
inspector
was
annoyed
you
know
methods
work
mac
but
will
hold
back
for
the
shortest
time
possible
only
wish
verify
details
one
way
which
can
very
readily
done
and
then
make
bow
and
return
london
leaving
results
entirely
your
service
owe
you
too
much
act
otherwise
for
all
experience
cannot
recall
any
more
singular
and
interesting
study
this
clean
beyond
holmes
saw
you
when
returned
from
tunbridge
wells
last
night
and
you
were
general
agreement
with
our
results
what
has
happened
since
then
give
you
completely
new
idea
the
case
well
since
you
ask
spent
told
you
that
would
some
hours
last
night
the
manor
house
well
what
happened
can
only
give
you
very
general
answer
that
for
the
moment
the
way
have
been
reading
short
but
clear
and
interesting
account
the
old
building
purchasable
the
modest
sum
one
penny
from
the
local
tobacconist
here
holmes
drew
small
tract
embellished
with
rude
engraving
the
ancient
manor
house
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
immensely
adds
the
zest
investigation
dear
mac
when
one
conscious
sympathy
with
the
historical
atmosphere
one
surroundings
don
look
impatient
for
assure
you
that
even
bald
account
this
raises
some
sort
picture
the
past
one
mind
permit
give
you
sample
erected
the
fifth
year
the
reign
james
and
standing
upon
the
site
much
older
building
the
manor
house
birlstone
presents
one
the
finest
surviving
examples
the
moated
jacobean
residence
you
are
making
fools
holmes
tut
tut
mac
the
first
sign
temper
have
detected
you
well
won
read
verbatim
since
you
feel
strongly
upon
the
subject
but
when
tell
you
that
there
some
account
the
taking
the
place
parliamentary
colonel
the
concealment
charles
for
several
days
the
course
the
civil
war
and
finally
visit
there
the
second
george
you
will
admit
that
there
are
various
associations
interest
connected
with
this
ancient
house
don
doubt
holmes
but
that
business
ours
not
not
breadth
view
dear
mac
one
the
essentials
our
profession
the
interplay
ideas
and
the
oblique
uses
knowledge
are
often
extraordinary
interest
you
will
excuse
these
remarks
from
one
who
though
mere
connoisseur
crime
still
rather
older
and
perhaps
more
experienced
than
yourself
the
first
admit
that
said
the
detective
heartily
you
get
your
point
admit
but
you
have
such
deuced
round
the
corner
way
doing
well
well
drop
past
history
and
get
down
present
day
facts
called
last
night
have
already
said
the
manor
house
did
not
see
either
barker
mrs
douglas
saw
necessity
disturb
them
but
was
pleased
hear
that
the
lady
was
not
visibly
pining
and
that
she
had
partaken
excellent
dinner
visit
was
specially
made
the
good
ames
with
whom
exchanged
some
amiabilities
which
culminated
his
allowing
without
reference
anyone
else
sit
alone
for
time
the
study
what
with
that
ejaculated
everything
now
order
you
gave
permission
for
that
mac
informed
the
room
was
its
normal
state
and
passed
instructive
quarter
hour
what
were
you
doing
well
not
make
mystery
simple
matter
was
looking
for
the
missing
dumb
bell
has
always
bulked
rather
large
estimate
the
case
ended
finding
where
there
come
the
edge
the
unexplored
let
little
further
very
little
further
and
will
promise
that
you
shall
share
everything
that
know
well
bound
take
you
your
own
terms
said
the
inspector
but
when
comes
telling
abandon
the
case
why
the
name
goodness
should
abandon
the
case
for
the
simple
reason
dear
mac
that
you
have
not
got
the
first
idea
what
that
you
are
investigating
are
investigating
the
murder
john
douglas
birlstone
manor
yes
yes
you
are
but
don
trouble
trace
the
mysterious
gentleman
upon
the
bicycle
assure
you
that
won
help
you
then
what
you
suggest
that
will
tell
you
exactly
what
you
will
well
bound
say
always
found
you
had
reason
behind
all
your
queer
ways
what
you
advise
and
you
white
mason
the
country
detective
looked
helplessly
from
one
the
other
holmes
and
his
methods
were
new
him
well
good
enough
for
the
inspector
good
enough
for
said
last
capital
said
holmes
well
then
should
recommend
nice
cheery
country
walk
for
both
you
they
tell
that
the
views
from
birlstone
ridge
over
the
weald
are
very
remarkable
doubt
lunch
could
got
some
suitable
hostelry
though
ignorance
the
country
prevents
from
recommending
one
the
evening
tired
but
happy
man
this
getting
past
joke
cried
macdonald
rising
angrily
from
his
chair
well
well
spend
the
day
you
like
said
holmes
patting
him
cheerfully
upon
the
shoulder
what
you
like
and
where
you
will
but
meet
here
before
dusk
without
fail
without
fail
mac
that
sounds
more
like
sanity
all
was
excellent
advice
but
don
insist
long
you
are
here
when
need
you
but
now
before
part
want
you
write
note
barker
well
dictate
you
like
ready
dear
sir
has
struck
that
our
duty
drain
the
moat
the
hope
that
may
find
some
impossible
said
the
inspector
made
inquiry
tut
tut
dear
sir
please
what
ask
you
well
the
hope
that
may
find
something
which
may
bear
upon
our
investigation
have
made
arrangements
and
the
workmen
will
work
early
morrow
morning
diverting
the
stream
impossible
diverting
the
stream
thought
best
explain
matters
beforehand
now
sign
that
and
send
hand
about
four
clock
that
hour
shall
meet
again
this
room
until
then
may
each
what
like
for
can
assure
you
that
this
inquiry
has
come
definite
pause
evening
was
drawing
when
reassembled
holmes
was
very
serious
his
manner
myself
curious
and
the
detectives
obviously
critical
and
annoyed
well
gentlemen
said
friend
gravely
asking
you
now
put
everything
the
test
with
and
you
will
judge
for
yourselves
whether
the
observations
have
made
justify
the
conclusions
which
have
come
chill
evening
and
not
know
how
long
our
expedition
may
last
beg
that
you
will
wear
your
warmest
coats
the
first
importance
that
should
our
places
before
grows
dark
with
your
permission
shall
get
started
once
passed
along
the
outer
bounds
the
manor
house
park
until
came
place
where
there
was
gap
the
rails
which
fenced
through
this
slipped
and
then
the
gathering
gloom
followed
holmes
until
had
reached
shrubbery
which
lies
nearly
opposite
the
main
door
and
the
drawbridge
the
latter
had
not
been
raised
holmes
crouched
down
behind
the
screen
laurels
and
all
three
followed
his
example
well
what
are
now
asked
macdonald
with
some
gruffness
possess
our
souls
patience
and
make
little
noise
possible
holmes
answered
what
are
here
for
all
really
think
that
you
might
treat
with
more
frankness
holmes
laughed
watson
insists
that
the
dramatist
real
life
said
some
touch
the
artist
wells
within
and
calls
insistently
for
well
staged
performance
surely
our
profession
mac
would
drab
and
sordid
one
did
not
sometimes
set
the
scene
glorify
our
results
the
blunt
accusation
the
brutal
tap
upon
the
shoulder
what
can
one
make
such
denouement
but
the
quick
inference
the
subtle
trap
the
clever
forecast
coming
events
the
triumphant
vindication
bold
theories
are
these
not
the
pride
and
the
justification
our
life
work
the
present
moment
you
thrill
with
the
glamour
the
situation
and
the
anticipation
the
hunt
where
would
that
thrill
had
been
definite
timetable
only
ask
little
patience
mac
and
all
will
clear
you
well
hope
the
pride
and
justification
and
the
rest
will
come
before
all
get
our
death
cold
said
the
london
detective
with
comic
resignation
all
had
good
reason
join
the
aspiration
for
our
vigil
was
long
and
bitter
one
slowly
the
shadows
darkened
over
the
long
sombre
face
the
old
house
cold
damp
reek
from
the
moat
chilled
the
bones
and
set
our
teeth
chattering
there
was
single
lamp
over
the
gateway
and
steady
globe
light
the
fatal
study
everything
else
was
dark
and
still
how
long
this
last
asked
the
inspector
finally
and
what
are
watching
for
have
more
notion
than
you
how
long
last
holmes
answered
with
some
asperity
criminals
would
always
schedule
their
movements
like
railway
trains
would
certainly
more
convenient
for
all
what
well
that
what
are
watching
for
spoke
the
bright
yellow
light
the
study
was
obscured
somebody
passing
and
fro
before
the
laurels
among
which
lay
were
immediately
opposite
the
window
and
not
more
than
hundred
feet
from
presently
was
thrown
open
with
whining
hinges
and
could
dimly
see
the
dark
outline
man
head
and
shoulders
looking
out
into
the
gloom
for
some
minutes
peered
forth
furtive
stealthy
fashion
one
who
wishes
assured
that
unobserved
then
leaned
forward
and
the
intense
silence
were
aware
the
soft
lapping
agitated
water
seemed
stirring
the
moat
with
something
which
held
his
hand
then
suddenly
hauled
something
fisherman
lands
fish
some
large
round
object
which
obscured
the
light
was
dragged
through
the
open
casement
now
cried
holmes
now
were
all
upon
our
feet
staggering
after
him
with
our
stiffened
limbs
while
ran
swiftly
across
the
bridge
and
rang
violently
the
bell
there
was
the
rasping
bolts
from
the
other
side
and
the
amazed
ames
stood
the
entrance
holmes
brushed
him
aside
without
word
and
followed
all
rushed
into
the
room
which
had
been
occupied
the
man
whom
had
been
watching
the
oil
lamp
the
table
represented
the
glow
which
had
seen
from
outside
was
now
the
hand
cecil
barker
who
held
towards
entered
its
light
shone
upon
his
strong
resolute
clean
shaved
face
and
his
menacing
eyes
what
the
devil
the
meaning
all
this
cried
what
are
you
after
anyhow
holmes
took
swift
glance
round
and
then
pounced
upon
sodden
bundle
tied
together
with
cord
which
lay
where
had
been
thrust
under
the
writing
table
this
what
are
after
barker
this
bundle
weighted
with
dumb
bell
which
you
have
just
raised
from
the
bottom
the
moat
barker
stared
holmes
with
amazement
his
face
how
thunder
came
you
know
anything
about
asked
simply
that
put
there
you
put
there
you
perhaps
should
have
said
replaced
there
said
holmes
you
will
remember
inspector
macdonald
that
was
somewhat
struck
the
absence
dumb
bell
drew
your
attention
but
with
the
pressure
other
events
you
had
hardly
the
time
give
the
consideration
which
would
have
enabled
you
draw
deductions
from
when
water
near
and
weight
missing
not
very
far
fetched
supposition
that
something
has
been
sunk
the
water
the
idea
was
least
worth
testing
with
the
help
ames
who
admitted
the
room
and
the
crook
watson
umbrella
was
able
last
night
fish
and
inspect
this
bundle
was
the
first
importance
however
that
should
able
prove
who
placed
there
this
accomplished
the
very
obvious
device
announcing
that
the
moat
would
dried
morrow
which
had
course
the
effect
that
whoever
had
hidden
the
bundle
would
most
certainly
withdraw
the
moment
that
darkness
enabled
him
have
less
than
four
witnesses
who
was
who
took
advantage
the
opportunity
and
barker
think
the
word
lies
now
with
you
sherlock
holmes
put
the
sopping
bundle
upon
the
table
beside
the
lamp

the

that
vermissa
flourishing

one
the

the

have
some
recollection
barker
that
you
associated
the
coal
districts
with
douglas

and
would
surely
not
too
far
fetched
inference
that
the
upon

might
stand
for

that
this
very
valley

sends
forth
emissaries

may
that

fear
which
have
heard
much
fairly
clear
and
now
barker
seem
standing
rather
the
way
your
explanation
was

expressive
face
during
this
exposition
the
great
detective
anger
amazement
consternation
and
indecision
swept
over
turn
finally
took
refuge
somewhat
acrid
irony
you
know
such
lot
holmes
perhaps
you
had
better
tell
some
more
sneered
have
doubt
that
could
tell
you
great
deal
more
barker
but
would
come
with
better
grace
from
you
you
think
you
well
all
can
say
that
there
any
secret
here
not
secret
and
not
the
man
give
away
well
you
take
that
line
barker
said
the
inspector
quietly
must
just
keep
you
sight
until
have
the
warrant
and
can
hold
you
you
can
what
you
damn
please
about
that
said
barker
defiantly
the
proceedings
seemed
have
come
definite
end
far
was
concerned
for
one
had
only
look
that
granite
face
realize
that
peine
forte
dure
would
ever
force
him
plead
against
his
will
the
deadlock
was
broken
however
woman
voice
mrs
douglas
had
been
standing
listening
the
half
opened
door
and
now
she
entered
the
room
you
have
done
enough
for
now
cecil
said
she
whatever
comes
the
future
you
have
done
enough
enough
and
more
than
enough
remarked
sherlock
holmes
gravely
have
every
sympathy
with
you
madam
and
should
strongly
urge
you
have
some
confidence
the
common
sense
our
jurisdiction
and
take
the
police
voluntarily
into
your
complete
confidence
may
that
myself
fault
for
not
following
the
hint
which
you
conveyed
through
friend
watson
but
that
time
had
every
reason
believe
that
you
were
directly
concerned
the
crime
now
assured
that
this
not
the
same
time
there
much
that
unexplained
and
should
strongly
recommend
that
you
ask
douglas
tell
his
own
story
mrs
douglas
gave
cry
astonishment
holmes
words
the
detectives
and
must
have
echoed
when
were
aware
man
who
seemed
have
emerged
from
the
wall
who
advanced
now
from
the
gloom
the
corner
which
had
appeared
mrs
douglas
turned
and
instant
her
arms
were
round
him
barker
had
seized
his
outstretched
hand
best
this
way
jack
his
wife
repeated
sure
that
best
indeed
yes
douglas
said
sherlock
holmes
sure
that
you
will
find
best
the
man
stood
blinking
with
the
dazed
look
one
who
comes
from
the
dark
into
the
light
was
remarkable
face
bold
gray
eyes
strong
short
clipped
grizzled
moustache
square
projecting
chin
and
humorous
mouth
took
good
look
all
and
then
amazement
advanced
and
handed
bundle
paper
heard
you
said
voice
which
was
not
quite
english
and
not
quite
american
but
was
altogether
mellow
and
pleasing
you
are
the
historian
this
bunch
well
watson
you
never
had
such
story
that
pass
through
your
hands
before
and
lay
last
dollar
that
tell
your
own
way
but
there
are
the
facts
and
you
can
miss
the
public
long
you
have
those
been
cooped
two
days
and
spent
the
daylight
hours
much
daylight
could
get
that
rat
trap
putting
the
thing
into
words
you
welcome
them
you
and
your
public
there
the
story
the
valley
fear
that
the
past
douglas
said
sherlock
holmes
quietly
what
desire
now
hear
your
story
the
present
you
have
sir
said
douglas
may
smoke
talk
well
thank
you
holmes
you
smoker
yourself
remember
right
and
you
guess
what
sitting
for
two
days
with
tobacco
your
pocket
and
afraid
that
the
smell
will
give
you
away
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
and
sucked
the
cigar
which
holmes
had
handed
him
heard
you
holmes
never
guessed
that
should
meet
you
but
before
you
are
through
with
that
nodded
papers
you
will
say
brought
you
something
fresh
inspector
macdonald
had
been
staring
the
newcomer
with
the
greatest
amazement
well
this
fairly
beats
cried
last
you
are
john
douglas
birlstone
manor
then
whose
death
have
been
investigating
for
these
two
days
and
where
the
world
have
you
sprung
from
now
you
seemed
come
out
the
floor
like
jack
box
mac
said
holmes
shaking
reproving
forefinger
you
would
not
read
that
excellent
local
compilation
which
described
the
concealment
king
charles
people
did
not
hide
those
days
without
excellent
hiding
places
and
the
hiding
place
that
has
once
been
used
may
again
had
persuaded
myself
that
should
find
douglas
under
this
roof
and
how
long
have
you
been
playing
this
trick
upon
holmes
said
the
inspector
angrily
how
long
have
you
allowed
waste
ourselves
upon
search
that
you
knew
absurd
one
not
one
instant
dear
mac
only
last
night
did
form
views
the
case
they
could
not
put
the
proof
until
this
evening
invited
you
and
your
colleague
take
holiday
for
the
day
pray
what
more
could
when
found
the
suit
clothes
the
moat
once
became
apparent
that
the
body
had
found
could
not
have
been
the
body
john
douglas
all
but
must
that
the
bicyclist
from
tunbridge
wells
other
conclusion
was
possible
therefore
had
determine
where
john
douglas
himself
could
and
the
balance
probability
was
that
with
the
connivance
his
wife
and
his
friend
was
concealed
house
which
had
such
conveniences
for
fugitive
and
awaiting
quieter
times
when
could
make
his
final
escape
well
you
figured
out
about
right
said
douglas
approvingly
thought
dodge
your
british
law
for
was
not
sure
how
stood
under
and
also
saw
chance
throw
these
hounds
once
for
all
off
track
mind
you
from
first
last
have
done
nothing
ashamed
and
nothing
that
would
not
again
but
you
judge
that
for
yourselves
when
tell
you
story
never
mind
warning
inspector
ready
stand
pat
upon
the
truth
not
going
begin
the
beginning
that
all
there
indicated
bundle
papers
and
mighty
queer
yarn
you
find
all
comes
down
this
that
there
are
some
men
that
have
good
cause
hate
and
would
give
their
last
dollar
know
that
they
had
got
long
alive
and
they
are
alive
there
safety
this
world
for
they
hunted
from
chicago
california
then
they
chased
out
america
but
when
married
and
settled
down
this
quiet
spot
thought
last
years
were
going
peaceable
never
explained
wife
how
things
were
why
should
pull
her
into
she
would
never
have
quiet
moment
again
but
would
always
imagining
trouble
fancy
she
knew
something
for
may
have
dropped
word
here
word
there
but
until
yesterday
after
you
gentlemen
had
seen
her
she
never
knew
the
rights
the
matter
she
told
you
all
she
knew
and
did
barker
here
for
the
night
when
this
thing
happened
there
was
mighty
little
time
for
explanations
she
knows
everything
now
and
would
have
been
wiser
man
had
told
her
sooner
but
was
hard
question
dear
took
her
hand
for
instant
his
own
and
acted
for
the
best
well
gentlemen
the
day
before
these
happenings
was
over
tunbridge
wells
and
got
glimpse
man
the
street
was
only
glimpse
but
have
quick
eye
for
these
things
and
never
doubted
who
was
was
the
worst
enemy
had
among
them
all
one
who
has
been
after
like
hungry
wolf
after
caribou
all
these
years
knew
there
was
trouble
coming
and
came
home
and
made
ready
for
guessed
fight
through
all
right
own
luck
was
proverb
the
states
about
never
doubted
that
would
with
still
was
guard
all
that
next
day
and
never
went
out
into
the
park
well
have
had
the
drop
with
that
buckshot
gun
his
before
ever
could
draw
him
after
the
bridge
was
mind
was
always
more
restful
when
that
bridge
was
the
evenings
put
the
thing
clear
out
head
never
dreamed
his
getting
into
the
house
and
waiting
for
but
when
made
round
dressing
gown
was
habit
had
sooner
entered
the
study
than
scented
danger
guess
when
man
has
had
dangers
his
life
and
had
more
than
most
time
there
kind
sixth
sense
that
waves
the
red
flag
saw
the
signal
clear
enough
and
yet
couldn
tell
you
why
next
instant
spotted
boot
under
the
window
curtain
and
then
saw
why
plain
enough
just
the
one
candle
that
was
hand
but
there
was
good
light
from
the
hall
lamp
through
the
open
door
put
down
the
candle
and
jumped
for
hammer
that
left
the
mantel
the
same
moment
sprang
saw
the
glint
knife
and
lashed
him
with
the
hammer
got
him
somewhere
for
the
knife
tinkled
down
the
floor
dodged
round
the
table
quick
eel
and
moment
later
got
his
gun
from
under
his
coat
heard
him
cock
but
had
got
hold
before
could
fire
had
the
barrel
and
wrestled
for
all
ends
for
minute
more
was
death
the
man
that
lost
his
grip
never
lost
his
grip
but
got
butt
downward
for
moment
too
long
maybe
was
that
pulled
the
trigger
maybe
just
jolted
off
between
anyhow
got
both
barrels
the
face
and
there
was
staring
down
all
that
was
left
ted
baldwin
recognized
him
the
township
and
again
when
sprang
for
but
his
own
mother
wouldn
recognize
him
saw
him
then
used
rough
work
but
fairly
turned
sick
the
sight
him
was
hanging
the
side
the
table
when
barker
came
hurrying
down
heard
wife
coming
and
ran
the
door
and
stopped
her
was
sight
for
woman
promised
come
her
soon
said
word
two
barker
took
all
glance
and
waited
for
the
rest
come
along
but
there
was
sign
them
then
understood
that
they
could
hear
nothing
and
that
all
that
had
happened
was
known
only
ourselves
was
that
instant
that
the
idea
came
was
fairly
dazzled
the
brilliance
the
man
sleeve
had
slipped
and
there
was
the
branded
mark
the
lodge
upon
his
forearm
see
here
the
man
whom
had
known
douglas
turned
his
own
coat
and
cuff
show
brown
triangle
within
circle
exactly
like
that
which
had
seen
upon
the
dead
man
was
the
sight
that
which
started
seemed
see
all
clear
glance
there
were
his
height
and
hair
and
figure
about
the
same
own
one
could
swear
his
face
poor
devil
brought
down
this
suit
clothes
and
quarter
hour
barker
and
had
put
dressing
gown
him
and
lay
you
found
him
tied
all
his
things
into
bundle
and
weighted
them
with
the
only
weight
could
find
and
put
them
through
the
window
the
card
had
meant
lay
upon
body
was
lying
beside
his
own
rings
were
put
his
finger
but
when
came
the
wedding
ring
held
out
his
muscular
hand
you
can
see
for
yourselves
that
had
struck
the
limit
have
not
moved
since
the
day
was
married
and
would
have
taken
file
get
off
don
know
anyhow
that
should
have
cared
part
with
but
had
wanted
couldn
just
had
leave
that
detail
take
care
itself
the
other
hand
brought
bit
plaster
down
and
put
where
wearing
one
myself
this
instant
you
slipped
there
holmes
clever
you
are
for
you
had
chanced
take
off
that
plaster
you
would
have
found
cut
underneath
well
that
was
the
situation

lie
low
for
while
and
then
get
away
where
could
joined
widow

have
chance
last
living
peace
for
the
rest

lives
these
devils
would
give
rest

above
ground
but
they
saw
the
papers
that
baldwin
had
got
his
man

end
all
troubles

this
hiding
place

ames
but
never
entered
his
head

with
the
matter
retired
into

barker
the
rest
guess
you
can
fill
for
yourselves
what
did
opened
the
window
and
made
the
mark
the
sill
give
idea
how
the
murderer
escaped
was
tall
order
that
but
the
bridge
was
there
was
other
way
then
when
everything
was
fixed
rang
the
bell

twenty
years
time

thousands
miles

and
terrible
that

past

meet
once
more

this
like
many
other
wonderful
happenings
will
find
its
end

the

the
year
had
been
severe
winter
and
the
snow
lay
deep
the
gorges
the
gilmerton
mountains
the
steam
ploughs
had
however
kept
the
railroad
open
and
the
evening
train
which
connects
the
long
line
coal
mining
and
iron
working
settlements
was
slowly
groaning

but
every

and
they
were
numerous
long
lines

piled
with
coal
and

told
the
hidden
wealth
which
had
brought
rude
population
and
bustling
life
this
most
desolate
corner
the
united
states
america
for
desolate
was
little
could
the
first
pioneer
who
had
traversed
have
ever
imagined
that
the
fairest
prairies
and
the
most
lush
water
pastures
were
valueless
compared
this
gloomy
land
black
crag
and
tangled
forest
above
the
dark
and
often
scarcely
penetrable
woods
upon
their
flanks

inquiringly
from
time
time
looks
round
through
his
spectacles
the
people
about
him
easy
see
that
sociable
and
possibly
simple
disposition
anxious
friendly
all
men
anyone
could
pick
him
once
gregarious
his
habits
and
communicative
his
nature
with
quick
wit
and
ready
smile
and
yet
the
man
who
studied
him
more
closely
might
discern
certain
firmness
jaw
and
grim
tightness
about
the
lips
which
would
warn
him
that
there
were
depths
beyond
and
that
this
pleasant
brown
haired
young
irishman
might
conceivably
leave
his
mark
for
good
evil
upon
any
society
which
was
introduced
having
made
one
two
tentative
remarks
the
nearest
miner
and
receiving
only
short
gruff
replies
the
traveller
resigned
himself
uncongenial
silence
staring
moodily
out
the
window
the
fading
landscape
was
not
cheering
prospect
through
the
growing
gloom
there
pulsed
the
red
glow
the
furnaces
the
sides
the
hills
great
heaps
slag
and
dumps
cinders
loomed
each
side
with
the
high
shafts
the
collieries
towering
above
them
huddled
groups
mean
wooden
houses
the
windows
which
were
beginning
outline
themselves
light
were
scattered
here
and
there
along
the
line
and
the
frequent
halting
places
were
crowded
with
their
swarthy
inhabitants
the
iron
and
coal
valleys
the
vermissa
district
were
resorts
for
the
leisured
the
cultured
everywhere
there
were
stern
signs
the
crudest
battle
life
the
rude
work
done
and
the
rude
strong
workers
who
did
the
young
traveller
gazed
out
into
this
dismal
country
with
face
mingled
repulsion
and
interest
which
showed
that
the
scene
was
new
him
intervals
drew
from
his
pocket
bulky
letter
which
referred
and
the
margins
which
scribbled
some
notes
once
from
the
back
his
waist
produced
something
which
one
would
hardly
have
expected
find
the
possession
mild
mannered
man
was
navy
revolver
the
largest
size
turned
slantwise
the
light
the
glint
upon
the
rims
the
copper
shells
within
the
drum
showed
that
was
fully
loaded
quickly
restored
his
secret
pocket
but
not
before
had
been
observed
working
man
who
had
seated
himself
upon
the
adjoining
bench
hullo

the
remark
had
singular
effect
upon
his
companion
glanced
round
suspiciously
the
others
the
car
the
miners
were
still
whispering
among
themselves
the
two
police
officers
were
dozing
came
across

himself
close
the
young
traveller
and
held
out
his
hand

the

scanlan
groaned
sympathetically

deep
penitentiary

the
rest
not
killing
early

things
said
mcmurdo
with
the
air
man
who
had
been
surprised
into
saying
more
than
intended
own
good
reasons
for
leaving
chicago
and
let
that
enough
for
you
who
are
you
that
you
should

gray
eyes
gleamed
with
sudden
and
dangerous
anger
from
behind
his
glasses

boss
mcginty
scanlan
descended
and
mcmurdo
was
left
once
again
his
thoughts
night
had
now
fallen
and
the
flames
the
frequent
furnaces
were
roaring
and
leaping
the
darkness
against
their
lurid
background
dark
figures
were
bending
and
straining
twisting
and
turning
with
the
motion
winch
windlass
the
rhythm
eternal
clank
and
roar
guess
hell
must
look
something
like
that
said
voice
mcmurdo
turned
and
saw
that
one
the
policemen
had
shifted
his
seat
and
was
staring
out
into
the
fiery
waste
for
that
matter
said
the
other
policeman
allow
that
hell
must
something
like
that
there
are
worse

mcmurdo
voice

carriage
round

altercation

ask
you
for
your
advice
did
you
think
such
sucker
that
couldn
move
without
you
speak
when
you
are
spoken
and
the
lord
you
have
wait
long
time
was
thrust
out
his
face
and
grinned
the
patrolmen
like
snarling
dog
the
two
policemen
heavy
good
natured
men
were
taken
aback
the
extraordinary
vehemence
with
which
their
friendly
advances
had
been
rejected
offense
stranger

was
warning
for
your

not

from

dare
look
the
like

the

don
make
any
mistake
about
that
there
was
murmur
sympathy
and
admiration
from
the
miners
the
dauntless
demeanour
the
newcomer
while
the
two
policemen
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
renewed
conversation
between
themselves
few
minutes
later
the
train
ran
into
the
ill
lit
station
and
there
was
general
clearing
for
vermissa
was
far
the
largest
town
the
line
mcmurdo
picked
his
leather
gripsack
and
was
about
start
off
into
the
darkness
when
one
the
miners
accosted
him
gar
mate
you
know
how
speak
the
cops
said
voice
awe
was
grand
hear
you
let
carry
your
grip
and
show
you
the
road
passing
shafter
the
way
own
shack
there
was
chorus
friendly
good
nights
from
the
other
miners
they
passed
from
the
platform
before
ever
had
set
foot
mcmurdo
the
turbulent
had
become
character
vermissa
the
country
had
been
place
terror
but
the
town
was
its
way
even
more
depressing
down
that
long
valley
there
was
least
certain
gloomy
grandeur
the
huge
fires
and
the
clouds
drifting
smoke
while
the
strength
and
industry
man
found
fitting
monuments
the
hills
which
had
spilled
the
side
his
monstrous
excavations
but
the
town
showed
dead
level
mean
ugliness
and
squalor
the
broad
street
was
churned
the
traffic
into
horrible
rutted
paste
muddy
snow
the
sidewalks
were
narrow
and
uneven
the
numerous
gas
lamps
served
only
show
more
clearly
long
line
wooden
houses
each
with
its
veranda
facing
the
street
unkempt
and
dirty
they
approached
the
centre
the
town
the
scene
was
brightened
row
well
lit
stores
and
even
more
cluster
saloons
and
gaming
houses
which
the
miners
spent
their
hard
earned
but
generous
wages
that
the
union
house
said
the
guide
pointing
one
saloon
which
rose
almost
the
dignity
being
hotel
jack
mcginty
the
boss
there
what
sort
man
mcmurdo
asked
what
have
you
never
heard
the
boss
how
could
have
heard
him
when
you
know
that
stranger
these
parts
well
thought
his
name
was
known
clear
across
the
country
been
the
papers
often
enough
what
for
well
the
miner
lowered
his
voice
over
the
affairs
what
affairs
good
lord
mister
you
are
queer
must
say
without
offense
there
only
one
set
affairs
that
you
hear
these
parts
and
that
the
affairs
the
scowrers
why
seem
have
read
the
scowrers
chicago
gang
murderers
are
they
not
hush
your
life
cried
the
miner
standing
still
alarm
and
gazing
amazement
his
companion
man
you
won
live
long
these
parts
you
speak
the
open
street
like
that
many
man
has
had
the
life
beaten
out
him
for
less
well
know
nothing
about
them
only
what
have
read
and
not
saying
that
you
have
not
read
the
truth
the
man
looked
nervously
round
him
spoke
peering
into
the
shadows
feared
see
some
lurking
danger
killing
murder
then
god
knows
there
murder
and
spare
but
don
you
dare
breathe
the
name
jack
mcginty
connection
with
stranger
for
every
whisper
goes
back
him
and
not
one
that
likely
let
pass
now
that
the
house
you
after
that
one
standing
back
from
the
street
you
find
old
jacob
shafter
that
runs
honest

this
township
thank
you
said
mcmurdo
and
shaking
hands
with
his
new
acquaintance
plodded
gripsack
hand
the
path
which
led
the
dwelling
house
the
door
which
gave
resounding
knock
was
opened
once
someone
very
different
from
what
had
expected
was
woman
young
and
singularly
beautiful
she
was
the
german
type
blonde
and
fair
haired
with
the
piquant
contrast
pair
beautiful
dark
eyes
with
which
she
surveyed
the
stranger
with
surprise
and
pleasing
embarrassment
which
brought
wave
colour
over
her
pale
face
framed
the
bright
light
the
open
doorway
seemed
mcmurdo
that
had
never
seen
more
beautiful
picture
the
more
attractive
for
its
contrast
with
the
sordid
and
gloomy
surroundings
lovely
violet
growing
upon
one
those
black
slag
heaps
the
mines
would
not
have
seemed
more
surprising
entranced
was
that
stood
staring
without
word
and
was
she
who
broke
the
silence
thought
was
father
said
she
with
pleasing
little
touch
german
accent
did
you
come
see
him
down
town
expect
him
back
every
minute
mcmurdo
continued
gaze
her
open
admiration
until
her
eyes
dropped
confusion
before
this
masterful
visitor
miss
said
last
hurry
see
him
but
your
house
was
recommended
for
board
thought
might
suit
and
now
know
will
you
are
quick

said
she
with
smile
anyone

right
away
heavy
elderly
man
came
plodding
the
path
few
words
mcmurdo

his

him

mcmurdo

his

the
most
important
person
shafter
there
were
ten
dozen
boarders
there
but
they
were
honest
foremen
commonplace
clerks
from
the
stores
very
different
calibre
from
the
young
irishman
evening
when
they
gathered
together
his
joke
was
always
the
readiest
his
conversation
the
brightest
and
his
song
the
best
was
born
boon
companion
with
magnetism
which
drew
good
humour
from
all
around
him
and
yet
showed
again
and
again
had
shown
the
railway
carriage
capacity
for
sudden
fierce
anger
which
compelled
the
respect
and
even
the
fear
those
who
met
him
for
the
law
too
and
all
who
were
connected
with
exhibited
bitter
contempt
which
delighted
some
and
alarmed
others
his
fellow
boarders
from
the
first
made
evident
his
open
admiration
that
the
daughter
the
house
had
won
his
heart
from
the
instant
that
had
set
eyes
upon
her
beauty
and
her
grace
was
backward
suitor
the
second
day
told
her
that
loved
her
and
from
then
onward
repeated
the
same
story
with
absolute
disregard
what
she
might
say
discourage
him
someone
else
would
cry
well
the
worse
luck
for

him
look
out

you
can
keep

the
day

come
when
you
will
say
yes
and
young
enough
wait
was
dangerous
suitor
with
his
glib
irish
tongue
and
his
pretty
coaxing
ways
there
was
about
him
also
that
glamour
experience
and
mystery
which
attracts
woman
interest
and
finally
her
love
could
talk
the
sweet
valleys
county
monaghan
from
which
came
the
lovely
distant
island
the
low
hills
and
green
meadows
which
seemed
the
more
beautiful
when
imagination
viewed
them
from
this
place
grime
and
snow
then
was
versed
the
life
the
cities
the
north
detroit
and
the
lumber
camps
michigan
and
finally
chicago
where
had
worked
planing
mill
and
afterwards
came
the
hint

the
feeling
that
strange
things
had
happened
him
that
great

strange
and
intimate
that
they
might
not

this
dreary

and
with
sympathy

turn
rapidly
and
naturally

and
don
fear
them
and
don
believe
them
said
mcmurdo
lived
among
rough
men
darling
and
instead
fearing
them
has
always
ended
that
they
have
feared
always
ettie
mad
the
face
these
men
your
father
says
have
done
crime
after
crime
the
valley
and
everyone
knows
them
name
how
comes
that
none
are
brought
justice
you
answer
that
ettie
because
witness
dares
appear
against
them
would
not
live
month
did
also
because
they
have
always
their
own
men
swear
that
the
accused
one
was
far
from
the
scene
the
crime
but
surely
jack
you
must
have
read
all
this
had
understood
that
every
paper
the
united
states
was
writing
about
well
have
read
something
true
but
had
thought
was
story
maybe
these
men
have
some
reason
what
they
maybe
they
are
wronged
and
have
other
way
help
themselves
jack
don
let
hear
you
speak

that
why
loathe
him
jack
now
can
tell
you
the
truth
loathe
him
with
all
heart
but
fear
him
also
fear
him
for
myself
but
above
all
fear
him
for
father
know
that
some
great
sorrow
would
come
upon
dared
say
what
really
felt
that
why
have
put
him
off
with
half
promises
was
real
truth
our
only
hope
but
you
would
fly
with
jack
could
take
father
with
and
live
forever
far
from
the
power
these
wicked
men
again
there
was
the
struggle
upon
mcmurdo
face
and
again
set
like
granite
harm
shall
come
you
ettie
nor
your

either
wicked
men
expect
you
may
find
that
bad

fury
then
turned
upon
his
heel
and
instant
later
the
outer
door
had
banged
behind
him
for
few
moments
mcmurdo
and
the
girl
stood
silence
then
she
threw
her
arms
around
him

why
should
you
not
down
and
make
friend
boss
mcginty
hurry
jack
hurry
get
your
word
first
the
hounds

your
trail
was
thinking
the
same
thing
said
mcmurdo
right
now
and
fix
you
can
tell
your
father
that
sleep
here
night
and
find
some
other
quarters
the
morning
the
bar
mcginty
saloon
was
crowded
usual
for
was
the
favourite
loafing
place
all
the
rougher
elements
the
town
the
man
was
popular
for
had
rough
jovial
disposition
which
formed
mask
covering
great
deal
which
lay
behind
but
apart
from
this
popularity
the
fear
which
was
held
throughout
the
township
and
indeed
down
the
whole
thirty
miles
the
valley
and
past
the
mountains
each
side
was
enough
itself
fill
his
bar
for
none
could
afford
neglect
his
good
will
besides
those
secret
powers
which
was
universally
believed
that
exercised
pitiless
fashion
was
high
public
official
municipal
councillor
and
commissioner
roads
elected
the
office
through
the
votes
the
ruffians
who
turn
expected
receive
favours
his
hands
assessments
and
taxes
were
enormous
the
public
works
were
notoriously
neglected
the
accounts
were
slurred
over
bribed
auditors
and
the
decent
citizen
was
terrorized
into
paying
public
blackmail
and
holding
his
tongue
lest
some
worse
thing
befall
him
thus
was
that
year
year
boss
mcginty
diamond
pins
became
more
obtrusive
his
gold
chains
more
weighty
across
more
gorgeous
vest
and
his
saloon
stretched
farther
and
farther
until
threatened
absorb
one
whole
side
the
market
square
mcmurdo
pushed
open
the
swinging
door
the
saloon
and
made
his
way
amid
the
crowd
men
within
through
atmosphere
blurred
with
tobacco
smoke
and
heavy
with
the
smell
spirits
the
place
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
huge
heavily
gilt
mirrors
upon
every
wall
reflected
and
multiplied
the
garish
illumination
there
were
several
bartenders
their
shirt
sleeves
hard
work
mixing
drinks
for
the
loungers
who
fringed
the
broad
brass
trimmed
counter
the
far
end
with
his
body
resting
upon
the
bar
and
cigar
stuck
acute
angle
from
the
corner
his
mouth
stood
tall
strong
heavily
built
man
who
could
none
other
than
the
famous
mcginty
himself
was
black
maned
giant
bearded
the
cheek
bones
and
with
shock
raven
hair
which
fell
his
collar
his
complexion
was
swarthy
that
italian
and
his
eyes
were
strange
dead
black
which
combined
with
slight
squint
gave
them
particularly
sinister
appearance
all
else
the
man
his
noble
proportions
his
fine
features
and
his
frank
bearing
fitted
with
that
jovial
man
man
manner
which
affected
here
one
would
say
bluff
honest
fellow
whose
heart
would
sound
however
rude
his
outspoken
words
might
seem
was
only
when
those
dead
dark
eyes
deep
and
remorseless
were
turned
upon
man
that
shrank
within
himself
feeling
that
was
face
face
with
infinite
possibility
latent
evil
with
strength
and
courage
and
cunning
behind
which
made
thousand
times
more
deadly
having
had
good
look
his
man
mcmurdo
elbowed
his
way
forward
with
his
usual
careless
audacity
and
pushed
himself
through
the
little
group
courtiers
who
were
fawning
upon
the
powerful
boss
laughing
uproariously
the
smallest
his
jokes
the
young
stranger
bold
gray
eyes
looked
back
fearlessly
through
their
glasses
the
deadly
black
ones
which
turned
sharply
upon
him
well
young
man
can
call
your
face
mind
new
here
mcginty

are
not

raised
glass
with
which
had
been
served
his
lips
and
elevated
his
little
finger
drank
mcginty
who
had
been
watching
him
narrowly
raised
his
thick
black
eyebrows
like

said

look
bit
closer

mcmurdo
for

parts
nor

all

neither
come
here
for
moment
behind
the
bar
there
was
small
room
there
lined
with
barrels
mcginty
carefully
closed
the
door
and
then
seated
himself
one
them
biting
thoughtfully
his
cigar
and
surveying
his
companion
with
those
disquieting
eyes
for
couple
minutes
sat
complete
silence
mcmurdo
bore
the
inspection
cheerfully
one
hand
his
coat
pocket
the
other
twisting
his
brown
moustache
suddenly
mcginty
stooped
and
produced
wicked
looking
revolver
see

said

and
there
end
the
matter
took
bottle
champagne

shelf
and
twisted

three
high
glasses

the
quarrelling

answered
baldwin
but
they
will
forever
brighten
and
this
swear
the
men
drank
their
glasses
and
the
same
ceremony
was
performed
between
baldwin
and
mcmurdo
there
cried
mcginty
rubbing
his
hands
that
the
end
the
black
blood
you
come
under
lodge
discipline

further
and
that
heavy
hand

mcmurdo
held
out
his
hand
baldwin
quick
quarrel
and
quick
forgive
hot
irish
blood
they
tell
but
over
for
and
bear
grudge
baldwin
had
take
the
proffered
hand
for
the
baleful
eye
the
terrible
boss
was
upon
him
but
his
sullen
face
showed
how
little
the
words
the
other
had
moved
him
mcginty
clapped
them
both
the
shoulders
tut
these
girls
these
girls
cried
think
that
the
same
petticoats
should
come
between
two
boys
the
devil
own
luck
well
the
colleen
inside
them
that
must
settle
the
question
for
outside
the
jurisdiction
bodymaster
and
the
lord
praised
for
that
have
enough
without
the
women
well
you
have
affiliated
lodge
brother
mcmurdo
have
our
own
ways
and
methods
different
from
chicago
saturday
night
our
meeting
and
you
come
then
make
you
free
forever
the
vermissa
valley
chapter
lodge
vermissa
the
day
following
the
evening
which
had
contained
many
exciting
events
mcmurdo
moved
his
lodgings
from
old
jacob
shafter
and
took
his
quarters
the
widow
macnamara
the
extreme
outskirts
the
town
scanlan
his
original
acquaintance
aboard
the
train
had
occasion
shortly
afterwards
move
into
vermissa
and
the
two
lodged
together
there
was
other
boarder
and
the
hostess
was
easy
going
old
irishwoman
who
left
them
themselves
that
they
had
freedom
for
speech
and
action
welcome
men
who
had
secrets
common
shafter
had
relented
the
extent
letting
mcmurdo
come
his
meals
there
when
liked
that
his
intercourse
with
ettie
was
means
broken
the
contrary
drew
closer
and
more
intimate
the
weeks
went
his
bedroom
his
new
abode
mcmurdo
felt
safe
take
out
the
coining
moulds
and
under
many
pledge
secrecy
number
brothers
from
the
lodge
were
allowed
come
and
see
them
each
carrying
away
his
pocket
some
examples
the
false
money
cunningly
struck
that
there
was
never
the
slightest
difficulty
danger
passing
why
with
such
wonderful
art
his
command
mcmurdo
should
condescend
work
all
was
perpetual
mystery
his
companions
though
made
clear
anyone
who
asked
him
that
lived
without
any
visible
means
would
very
quickly
bring
the
police
upon
his
track
one
policeman
was
indeed
after
him
already
but
the
incident
luck
would
have
did
the
adventurer
great
deal
more
good
than
harm
after
the
first
introduction
there
were
few
evenings
when
did
not
find
his
way
mcginty
saloon
there
make
closer
acquaintance
with
the
boys
which
was
the
jovial
title
which
the
dangerous
gang
who
infested
the
place
were
known
one
another
his
dashing
manner
and
fearlessness
speech
made
him
favourite
with
them
all
while
the
rapid
and
scientific
way
which
polished
off
his
antagonist
all
bar
room
scrap
earned
the
respect
that
rough
community
another
incident
however
raised
him
even
higher
their
estimation
just
the
crowded
hour
one
night
the
door
opened
and
man
entered
with
the
quiet
blue
uniform
and
peaked
cap
the
mine
police
this
was
special
body
raised
the
railways

supplement
the
efforts
the
ordinary
civil

who
were
perfectly
helpless
the
face
the
organized
ruffianism
which
terrorized
the
district
there
was
hush
entered
and
many
curious
glance
was
cast
him
but
the
relations
between
policemen
and
criminals
are
peculiar
some
parts
the
states
and
mcginty
himself
standing
behind
his
counter
showed
surprise
when
the
policeman
enrolled
himself
among
his
customers
straight
whisky
for
the
night
bitter
said
the
police
officer

the
captain
but
the
lord

get
off
after
this
another
story
good
night
you
and
good
night
councillor
left
the
bar
room
but
not
before
had
created
local
hero
mcmurdo
deeds
far
chicago
had
been
whispered
before
had
put
off
all
questions
with
smile
one
who
did
not
wish
have
greatness
thrust
upon
him
but
now
the
thing
was
officially
confirmed
the
bar
loafers
crowded
round
him
and
shook
him
heartily
the
hand
was
free
the
community
from
that
time
could
drink
hard
and
show
little
trace
but
that
evening
had
his
mate
scanlan
not
been
hand
lead
him
home
the
feted
hero
would
surely
have
spent
his
night
under
the
bar
saturday
night
mcmurdo
was
introduced
the
lodge
had
thought
pass
without
ceremony
being
initiate
chicago
but
there
were
particular
rites
vermissa
which
they
were
proud
and
these
had
undergone
every
postulant
the
assembly
met
large
room
reserved
for
such
purposes
the
union
house
some
sixty
members
assembled
vermissa
but
that
means
represented
the
full
strength
the
organization
for
there
were
several
other
lodges
the
valley
and
others
across
the
mountains
each
side
who
exchanged
members
when
any
serious
business
was
afoot
that
crime
might
done
men
who
were
strangers
the
locality
altogether
there
were
not
less
than
five
hundred
scattered
over
the
coal
district
the
bare
assembly
room
the
men
were
gathered
round
long
table
the
side
was
second
one
laden
with
bottles
and
glasses
which
some
members
the
company
were
already
turning
their
eyes
mcginty
sat
the
head
with
flat
black
velvet
cap
upon
his
shock
tangled
black
hair
and
coloured
purple
stole
round
his
neck
that
seemed
priest
presiding
over
some
diabolical
ritual
right
and
left
him
were
the
higher
lodge
officials
the
cruel
handsome
face
ted
baldwin
among
them
each
these
wore
some
scarf
medallion
emblem
his
office
they
were
for
the
most
part
men
mature
age
but
the
rest
the
company
consisted
young
fellows
from
eighteen
twenty
five
the
ready
and
capable
agents
who
carried
out
the
commands
their
seniors
among
the
older
men
were
many
whose
features
showed
the
tigerish
lawless
souls
within
but
looking
the
rank
and
file
was
difficult
believe
that
these
eager
and
open
faced
young
fellows
were
very
truth
dangerous
gang
murderers
whose
minds
had
suffered
such
complete
moral
perversion
that
they
took
horrible
pride
their
proficiency
the
business
and
looked
with
deepest
respect
the
man
who
had
the
reputation
making
what
they
called
clean
job
their
contorted
natures
had
become
spirited
and
chivalrous
thing
volunteer
for
service
against
some
man
who
had
never
injured
them
and
whom
many
cases
they
had
never
seen
their
lives
the
crime
committed
they
quarrelled
who
had
actually
struck
the
fatal
blow
and
amused
one
another
and
the
company
describing
the
cries
and
contortions
the
murdered
man
first
they
had
shown
some
secrecy
their
arrangements
but
the
time
which
this
narrative
describes
their
proceedings
were
extraordinarily
open
for
the
repeated
failure
the
law
had
proved
them
that
the
one
hand
one
would
dare
witness
against
them
and
the
other
they
had
unlimited
number
stanch
witnesses
upon
whom
they
could
call
and
well
filled
treasure
chest
from
which
they
could
draw
the
funds
engage
the
best
legal
talent
the
state
ten
long
years
outrage
there
had
been
single
conviction
and
the
only
danger
that
ever
threatened
the
scowrers
lay
the
victim
himself
who
however
outnumbered
and
taken
surprise
might
and
occasionally
did
leave
his
mark
upon
his
assailants
mcmurdo
had
been
warned
that
some
ordeal
lay
before
him
but
one
would
tell
him
what
consisted
was
led
now
into
outer
room
two
solemn
brothers
through
the
plank
partition
could
hear
the
murmur
many
voices
from
the
assembly
within
once
twice
caught
the
sound
his
own
name
and
knew
that
they
were
discussing
his
candidacy
then
there
entered
inner
guard
with
green
and
gold
sash
across
his
chest
the
bodymaster
orders
that
shall
trussed
blinded
and
entered
said
the
three
them
removed
his
coat
turned
the
sleeve
his
right
arm
and
finally
passed
rope
round
above
the
elbows
and
made
fast
they
next
placed
thick
black
cap
right
over
his
head
and
the
upper
part
his
face
that
could
see
nothing
was
then
led
into
the
assembly
hall
was
pitch
dark
and
very
oppressive
under
his
hood
heard
the
rustle
and
murmur
the
people
round
him
and
then
the
voice
mcginty
sounded
dull
and
distant
through
the
covering
his
ears
john
mcmurdo
said
the
voice
are
you
already
member
the
ancient
order
freemen
bowed
assent
your
lodge
chicago
bowed
again
dark
nights
are
unpleasant
said
the
voice
yes
for
strangers
travel
answered
the
clouds
are
heavy
yes
storm
approaching
are
the
brethren
satisfied
asked
the
bodymaster
there
was
general
murmur
assent
know
brother
your
sign
and
your
countersign
that
you
are
indeed
one
said
mcginty
would
have
you
know
however
that
this
county
and
other
counties
these
parts
have
certain
rites
and
also
certain
duties
our
own
which
call
for
good
men
are
you
ready
tested
are
you
stout
heart
take
stride
forward
prove
the
words
were
said
felt
two
hard
points
front
his
eyes
pressing
upon
them
that
appeared
could
not
move
forward
without
danger
losing
them
none
the
less
nerved
himself
step
resolutely
out
and
did
the
pressure
melted
away
there
was
low
murmur
applause
stout
heart
said
the
voice
can
you
bear
pain
well
another
answered
test
him
was
all
could
keep
himself
from
screaming
out
for
agonizing
pain
shot
through
his
forearm
nearly
fainted
the
sudden
shock
but
bit
his
lip
and
clenched
his
hands
hide
his
agony
can
take
more
than
that
said
this
time
there
was
loud
applause
finer
first
appearance
had
never

what

left
the

the

ring
blackmailers
gar
was
well
that
made
break
for
before
the
note
reached
guess
won
show
his
face
this
valley
again
elderly
clean
shaved
man
with
kindly
face
and
good
brow
rose
from
the
end
the
table
which
faced
the
chairman
treasurer
asked
may
ask
who
has
bought
the
property
this
man
that
have
driven
out
the
district
yes
brother
morris
has
been
bought
the
state
merton
county
railroad
company
and
who
bought
the
mines
todman
and
lee
that
came
into
the
market
the
same
way
last
year
the
same
company
brother
morris
and
who
bought
the
ironworks
manson
and
shuman
and
van
deher
and
atwood
which
have
all
been
given
late
they
were
all
bought
the
west
gilmerton
general
mining
company
don
see
brother
morris
said
the
chairman
that
matters
who
buys
them
since
they
can
carry
them
out
the
district
with
all
respect
you
eminent
bodymaster
think
may
matter
very
much
this
process
has
been
going
now
for
ten
long
years
are
gradually
driving
all
the
small
men
out
trade
what
the
result
find
their
places
great
companies
like
the
railroad
the
general
iron
who
have
their
directors
new
york
philadelphia
and
care
nothing
for
our
threats
can
take
out
their
local
bosses
but
only
means
that
others
will
sent
their
stead
and
are
making
dangerous
for
ourselves
the
small
men
could
not
harm
they
had
not
the
money
nor
the
power
long
did
not
squeeze
them
too
dry
they
would
stay
under
our
power
but
these
big
companies
find
that
stand
between
them
and
their
profits
they
will
spare
pains
and
expense
hunt
down
and
bring
court
there
was
hush
these
ominous
words
and
every
face
darkened
gloomy
looks
were
exchanged
omnipotent
and
unchallenged
had
they
been
that
the
very
thought
that
there
was
possible
retribution
the
background
had
been
banished
from
their
minds
and
yet
the
idea
struck
chill
the
most
reckless
them
advice
the
speaker
continued
that
easier
upon
the
small
men
the
day
that
they
have
all
been
driven
out
the
power
this
society
will
have
been
broken
unwelcome
truths
are
not
popular
there
were
angry
cries
the
speaker
resumed
his
seat
mcginty
rose
with
gloom
upon
his
brow
brother
morris
said
you
were
always
croaker
long
the
members
this
lodge
stand
together
there
power
the
united
states
that
can
touch
them
sure
have
not
tried
often
enough
the
lawcourts
expect
the
big
companies
will
find
easier
pay
than
fight
same
the
little
companies
and
now
brethren
mcginty
took
off
his
black
velvet
cap
and
his
stole
spoke
this
lodge
has
finished
its
business
for
the
evening
save
for
one
small
matter
which
may
mentioned
when
are
parting
the
time
has
now
come
for
fraternal
refreshment
and
for
harmony
strange
indeed
human
nature
here
were
these
men
whom
murder
was
familiar
who
again
and
again
had
struck
down
the
father
the
family
some
man
against
whom
they
had
personal
feeling
without
one
thought
compunction
compassion
for
his
weeping
wife
helpless
children
and
yet
the
tender
pathetic
music
could
move
them
tears
mcmurdo
had
fine
tenor
voice
and
had
failed
gain
the
good
will
the
lodge
before
could
longer
have
been
withheld
after
had
thrilled
them
with
sitting
the
stile
mary
and
the
banks
allan
water
his
very
first
night
the
new
recruit
had
made
himself
one
the
most
popular
the
brethren
marked
already
for
advancement
and
high
office
there
were
other
qualities
needed
however
besides
those
good
fellowship
make
worthy
freeman
and
these
was
given
example
before
the
evening
was
over
the
whisky
bottle
had
passed
round
many
times
and
the
men
were
flushed
and
ripe
for
mischief
when
their
bodymaster
rose
once
more
address
them
boys
said
there
one
man
this
town
that

james

how
been
opening
his

there
was

with

mcginty
took
slip
paper
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
law
and
order
that
how

twelve
years

now
elapsed
since
the
first
assassinations
which
proved
the
existence
criminal
organization
our
midst
from
that
day
these
outrages
have
never
ceased
until
now
they
have
reached
pitch
which
makes
the
opprobrium
the
civilized
world
for
such
results
this
that
our
great
country
welcomes
its
bosom
the
alien
who
flies
from
the
despotisms
europe
that
they
shall
themselves
become
tyrants
over
the
very
men
who
have
given
them
shelter
and
that
state
terrorism
and
lawlessness
should
established
under
the
very
shadow
the
sacred
folds
the
starry
flag
freedom
which
would
raise
horror
our
minds
read
existing

the
most
effete

tossing
the
paper
down
upon
the
table
that
what

question
asking
you
what
shall
say
him
kill

cried
dozen
fierce
voices
protest
against
that
said
brother
morris
the
man
the
good
brow
and
shaved
face
tell
you
brethren
that
our
hand
too
heavy

valley
and
that
there
will
come
point
where
self
defense
every
man
will
unite
crush
out
james
stanger
old
man
respected
the
township
and
the
district
his
paper
stands
for
all
that
solid
the
valley
that
man
struck
down
there
will
stir
through
this
state
that
will
only
end
with
our
destruction
and
how
would
they
bring
about
our
destruction
standback
cried
mcginty
the
police
sure
half
them
are
our
pay
and
half
them
afraid
the
law
courts
and
the
judge
haven
tried
that
before
now
and
what
ever
came
there

try

said
brother
morris
general
shout
anger
greeted
the
suggestion
have
but
raise
finger
cried
mcginty
and
could
put
two
hundred
men
into
this
town
that
would
clear
out
from
end
end
then
suddenly
raising
his
voice
and
bending
his
huge
black
brows
into
terrible
frown
see
here
brother
morris
have
eye
you
and
have
had
for
some
time
you

you
try
take

heart
out

ill

for
you
brother
morris
when
your
own
name
comes

agenda
paper
and
thinking
that
just
there
that
ought
place
morris
had
turned
deadly
pale
and
his
knees
seemed
give
way
under
him
fell
back
into
his
chair
raised
his
glass
his
trembling
hand
and
drank
before
could
answer
apologize
eminent
bodymaster
you
and
every
brother
this
lodge
have
said
more
than

faithful

you
all
know
that
and
fear
lest
evil
come
the
lodge
which
makes

anxious
words
but
have
greater
trust
your
judgment
than
own
eminent
bodymaster
and
promise
you
that

not
offend

the
bodymaster
scowl
relaxed
listened
the
humble
words
very

myself
that

sorry
were
needful
give
you
lesson
but
long
this
chair
shall
united
lodge
word
and

and
now
boys
continued
looking
round
the
company
say
this
much
that
stanger
got
his
full
deserts
there
would
more
trouble
than
need
ask
for
these
editors
hang
together
and
every
journal
the

out
for

and

but
guess

pretty
severe
warning

the

broke
with
shouts
and
yells
and
snatches
drunken
song
the
bar
was
still
crowded
with
revellers
and
many
the
brethren
remained
there
the
little
band
who
had
been
told
off
for
duty
passed
out
into
the
street
proceeding

and
threes
along

his
face
and
half
dozen
sticks

clattering
together

still
stooping
over

when
mcmurdo
awoke
next
morning
had
good
reason
remember
his
initiation
into
the
lodge
his
head
ached
with
the
effect
the

and
his

where
had
been

himself
more
familiar
than
the
writer
could
have
been
ended
with
the
statement
the
matter
now
the
hands
the
police
but
can
hardly
hoped
that
their
exertions
will
attended
any
better
results
than
the
past
some
the
men
were
recognized
and
there
hope
that
conviction
may
obtained
the
source
the
outrage
was
need
hardly
said
that
infamous
society
which
has
held
this
community
bondage
for
long
period
and
against
which
the
herald
has
taken
uncompromising
stand
stanger
many
friends
will
rejoice
hear
that
though
has
been
cruelly
and
brutally
beaten
and
though
has
sustained
severe
injuries
about
the

mcmurdo
had
laid
down
the

and
was
lighting
his
pipe
with
hand
which
was
shaky
from
the
excesses
the
previous
evening
when
there
was
knock
outside
and
his
landlady
brought
him
note
which
had
just
been
handed
lad

unsigned
and
ran
thus
should
wish
speak
you
but
would
rather
not
your
house
you
will
find
beside
the
flagstaff
upon
miller
hill
you
will
come
there
now
have
something
which
important
for
you
hear
and
for
say
mcmurdo
read
the
note
twice
with
the
utmost
surprise
for
could
not
imagine
what
meant
who
was
the
author
had
been
feminine
hand
might
have
imagined
that
was
the
beginning
one
those
adventures
which
had
been
familiar
enough
his
past
life
but
was
the
writing
man
and
well
educated
one
too
finally
after
some
hesitation
determined
see
the
matter
through
miller
hill
ill
kept
public
park
the
very
centre
the
town
summer
favourite
resort
the
people
but
winter
desolate
enough
from
the
top
one
has
view
not
only
the
whole
straggling
grimy
town
but
the
winding
valley
beneath
with
its
scattered
mines
and
factories
blackening
the
snow
each
side
and
the
wooded
and
white
capped
ranges
flanking
mcmurdo
strolled
the
winding
path
hedged
with
evergreens
until
reached
the
deserted
restaurant
which
forms
the
centre
summer
gaiety
beside
was
bare
flagstaff
and
underneath
man
his
hat
drawn
down
and
the
collar
his
overcoat
turned
when
turned
his
face
mcmurdo
saw
that

night
before

morris
sure

said
mcmurdo
thinking
that
you

weak
man
and
that
you
make
too
much
the
matter
too
much
wait
till
you
have
lived
here

down
the
valley

mcmurdo
carelessly
what
very
clear
that
you
are
not
the
man
for
the
place
and
that
the
sooner
you
sell
out
you
only
get
dime
dollar
for
what
the
business
worth
the
better
will
for
you
what

cried
morris
piteously
well
let
rest
that
bear
what
you
have
said
mind
and
maybe
some
day
come
back
expect
you
meant
kindly
speaking
like
this
now
getting
home
one
word
before
you
said
morris
may
have
been
seen
together
they
may
want

what
have
spoken
about
that
well
thought
offer
you
clerkship
store
and
refuse
that
our
business
well
long
brother
morris
and
may
you
find
things
better
with
you
the
future
that
same
afternoon
mcmurdo
sat
smoking
lost
thought
beside
the
stove
his
sitting
room
the
door
swung
open
and
its
framework
was
filled
with
the
huge
figure
boss
mcginty
passed
the
sign
and
then
seating
himself
opposite
the
young
man
looked
him
steadily
for
some
time
look
which
was
steadily
returned
not
much
visitor
brother
mcmurdo
said
last
guess
too
busy
over
the
folk
that
visit
but
thought
stretch
point
and
drop
down
see
you
your
own
house
proud
see
you
here
councillor
mcmurdo
answered
heartily
bringing
his
whisky
bottle
out
the
cupboard
honour
that
had
not
expected
how
the
arm
asked
the
boss
mcmurdo
made
wry
face
well
not
forgetting
said
but
worth
yes
worth
the
other
answered
those
that
are
loyal
and
through
with
and
are
help
the
lodge
what
were
you
speaking
brother
morris
about
miller
hill
this
morning
the
question
came
suddenly
that
was
well
that
had
his
answer
prepared
burst
into
hearty
laugh
morris
didn
know
could
earn
living
here
home
shan
know
either
for
has
got
too
much
conscience
for
the
likes
but
good
hearted
old
chap
was
his
idea
that
was
loose
end
and
that
would
good
turn
offering
clerkship
drygoods
store
that
was
yes
that
was
and
you
refused
sure
couldn
earn
ten
times
much
own
bedroom
with
four
hours
work
that
but
wouldn
get
about
too
much
with
morris
why
not
well
guess
because
tell
you
not
that
enough
for
most
folk
these
parts
may
enough
for
most
folk
but
ain
enough
for
councillor
said
mcmurdo
boldly
you
are
judge
men
you
know
that
the
swarthy
giant
glared
him
and
his
hairy
paw
closed
for
instant
round
the
glass
though

hurl
the
head
his
companion
then
laughed
his
loud
boisterous
insincere
fashion
you

morris
say

his
heart
not

pen
but
you
keep
company
with
disloyal
man
might
think
that
you

disloyal
too
see
there

company
with
him
for
dislike
the
man
mcmurdo
answered
being
disloyal

any

enough
said
mcginty

his
leavetaking
was
cut
short
very
unexpected
fashion
with
sudden
crash
the
door
flew
open
and
three
frowning
intent
faces
glared
them
from
under
the
peaks
police
caps
mcmurdo
sprang
his
feet
and
half
drew
his
revolver
but
his
arm
stopped

was
with

midnight
and

gun
across
your
head
you

mcginty
for

when

was
the
appearance
the
captain
that
both
mcmurdo
and
his
boss
were
forced
accept
the
situation
the
latter
managed
have
few
whispered
words
with
the
prisoner
before
they
parted
what
about
jerked
his
thumb
upward
signify
the
coining
plant
all
right
whispered
mcmurdo
who
had
devised
safe
hiding
place
under
the
floor
bid
you
good
bye
said
the
boss
shaking
hands
see
reilly
the
lawyer
and
take
the
defense
upon
myself
take
word
for
that
they
won
able
hold
you
wouldn
bet
that
guard
the
prisoner
you
two
and
shoot
him
tries
any
games
search
the
house
before
leave
did
but
apparently
found
trace
the
concealed
plant
when
had
descended
and
his
men
escorted
mcmurdo
headquarters
darkness
had
fallen
and
keen
blizzard
was
blowing
that
the
streets
were
nearly
deserted
but
few
loiterers
followed
the
group
and
emboldened
invisibility
shouted
imprecations
the
prisoner
lynch
the
cursed
scowrer
they
cried
lynch
him
they
laughed
and
jeered
was
pushed
into
the

short
formal
examination
from
the
inspector

was
put
into
the
common
cell
here
found
baldwin
and
three
other
criminals
the
night
before
all
arrested
that
afternoon
and
waiting
their
trial
next
morning
but
even
within
this
inner
fortress
the
law
the
long
arm
the
freemen
was
able
extend
late
night
there
came
jailer
with
straw
bundle
for
their
bedding
out
which
extracted
two
bottles
whisky
some
glasses
and
pack
cards
they
spent
hilarious
night
without
anxious
thought
the
ordeal
the
morning
nor
had
they
cause
the
result
was
show
the
magistrate
could
not
possibly
the
evidence
have
held
them
for
higher
court
the
one
hand
the
compositors
and
pressmen
were
forced
admit
that
the
light
was
uncertain
that
they
were
themselves
much
perturbed
and
that
was
difficult
for
them
swear
the
identity
the
assailants
although
they
believed
that
the
accused
were
among
them
cross
examined
the
clever
attorney
who
had
been
engaged
mcginty
they
were
even
more
nebulous
their
evidence
the
injured
man
had
already
deposed
that
was
taken
surprise
the
suddenness
the
attack
that
could
state
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
the
first
man
who
struck
him
wore
moustache
added
that
knew
them
scowrers
since
one
else
the
community
could
possibly
have
any
enmity
him
and
had
long
been
threatened
account
his
outspoken
editorials
the
other
hand
was
clearly
shown
the
united
and
unfaltering
evidence
six
citizens
including
that
high
municipal
official
councillor
mcginty
that
the
men
had
been
card
party
the
union
house
until
hour
very
much
later
than
the
commission
the
outrage
needless
say
that
they
were
discharged
with
something
very
near
apology
from
the
bench
for
the
inconvenience
which
they
had
been
put
together
with
implied
censure
captain
marvin
and
the
police
for
their
officious
zeal
the
verdict
was
greeted
with
loud
applause
court
which
mcmurdo
saw
many
familiar
faces
brothers
the
lodge
smiled
and
waved
but
there
were
others
who
sat
with
compressed
lips
and
brooding
eyes
the
men
filed
out
the
dock
one
them
little
dark
bearded
resolute
fellow
put
the
thoughts
himself
and
comrades
into
words
the
prisoners
passed
him
you
damned
murderers
said
fix
you
yet
chapter
the
darkest
hour
anything
had
been
needed
give
impetus
jack
mcmurdo
popularity
among
his
fellows
would
have
been
his
arrest
and
acquittal
that
man
the
very
night
joining
the
lodge
should
have
done
something
which
brought
him
before
the
magistrate
was
new
record
the
annals
the
society
already
had
earned
the
reputation
good
boon
companion
cheery
reveller
and
withal
man
high
temper
who
would
not
take
insult
even
from
the
all
powerful
boss
himself
but
addition
this
impressed
his
comrades
with
the
idea
that
among
them
all
there
was
not
one
whose
brain
was
ready
devise
bloodthirsty
scheme
whose
hand
would
more
capable
carrying
out
the
boy
for
the
clean
job
said
the
oldsters
one
another
and
waited
their
time
until
they
could
set
him
his
work
mcginty
had
instruments
enough
already
but
recognized
that
this
was
supremely
able
one
felt
like
man
holding
fierce
bloodhound
leash
there
were
curs
the
smaller
work
but
some
day
would
slip
this
creature
upon
its
prey
few
members
the
lodge
ted
baldwin
among
them
resented
the
rapid
rise
the
stranger
and
hated
him
for
but
they
kept
clear
him
for
was
ready
fight
laugh
but
gained
favour
with
his
fellows
there
was
another
quarter
one
which
had
become
even
more
vital
him
which
lost
ettie
shafter
father
would
have
nothing
more
with
him
nor
would
allow
him
enter
the
house
ettie
herself
was
too
deeply
love
give
him
altogether
and
yet
her
own
good
sense
warned
her
what
would
come
from
marriage
with
man
who
was
regarded
criminal
one
morning
after
sleepless
night
she
determined
see
him
possibly
for
the
last
time
and
make
one
strong
endeavour
draw
him
from
those
evil
influences
which
were
sucking
him
down
she
went
his
house
had
often
begged
her
and
made
her
way
into
the
room
which
used
his
sitting
room
was
seated

with
his
back
turned
and
letter
front
him
sudden
spirit
girlish
mischief
came
over
her
she
was
still
only
nineteen
had
not
heard
her
when
she
pushed
open
the
door
now
she
tiptoed
forward
and
laid
her
hand
lightly
upon
his
bended
shoulders
she
had
expected
startle
him
she
certainly
succeeded
but
only
turn
startled
herself
with
tiger
spring
turned
her
and
his
right
hand
was
feeling
for
her
throat
the
same
instant
with
the
other
hand
crumpled
the
paper
that
lay
before
him
for
instant
stood
glaring
then
astonishment
and
joy
took
the
place
the
ferocity
which
had
convulsed
his
features
ferocity
which
had
sent
her
shrinking
back
horror
from
something
which
had
never
before
intruded
into
her
gentle
life
you
said
mopping
his
brow
and
think
that
you
should
come

better
than

then
darling
and
held
out
his
arms
let
make
you
but
she
had
not
recovered
from
that
sudden
glimpse
guilty
fear
which
she
had
read
the
man

all
her
woman

told
her
that

more

then
sudden
suspicion
seized
her

cried

was
the
most
that
ettie
could
obtain
and
yet
was
something
there
was
this
distant
light
illuminate
the
gloom
the
immediate
future
she
returned
her
father
house
more
light
hearted
than
she
had
ever
been
since
jack
mcmurdo
had
come
into
her
life
might
thought
that
member
all
the
doings
the
society
would
told
him
but
was
soon
discover
that
the
organization
was
wider
and
more
complex
than
the
simple
lodge
even
boss
mcginty
was
ignorant
many
things
for
there
was
official
named
the
county
delegate
living
hobson
patch
farther
down
the
line
who
had
power
over
several
different
lodges
which
wielded
sudden
and
arbitrary
way
only
once
did
mcmurdo
see
him
sly
little
gray
haired
rat
man
with
slinking
gait
and
sidelong
glance
which
was
charged
with
malice
evans
pott
was
his
name
and
even
the
great
boss
vermissa
felt
towards
him
something
the
repulsion
and
fear
which
the
huge
danton
may
have
felt
for
the
puny
but
dangerous
robespierre
one
day
scanlan
who
was
mcmurdo
fellow
boarder
received
note
from
mcginty
inclosing
one
from
evans
pott
which
informed
him
that
was
sending
over
two
good
men
lawler
and
andrews
who
had
instructions
act
the
neighbourhood
though
was
best
for
the
cause
that
particulars
their
objects
should
given
would
the
bodymaster
see
that
suitable
arrangements
made
for
their
lodgings
and
comfort
until
the
time
for
action
should
arrive
mcginty
added
that
was
impossible
for
anyone
remain
secret
the
union
house
and
that
therefore
would
obliged
mcmurdo
and
scanlan
would
put
the
strangers
for
few
days
their
boarding
house
the
same
evening
the
two
men
arrived
each
carrying
his
gripsack
lawler
was
elderly
man
shrewd
silent
and
self
contained
clad
old
black
frock
coat
which
with
his
soft
felt
hat
and
ragged
grizzled
beard
gave
him
general
resemblance
itinerant
preacher
his
companion
andrews
was
little
more
than
boy
frank
faced
and
cheerful
with
the
breezy
manner
one
who
out
for
holiday
and
means
enjoy
every
minute
both
men
were
total
abstainers
and
behaved
all
ways
exemplary
members
the
society
with
the
one
simple
exception
that
they
were
assassins
who
had
often
proved
themselves
most
capable
instruments
for
this
association
murder
lawler
had
already
carried
out
fourteen
commissions
the
kind
and
andrews
three
they
were
mcmurdo
found
quite
ready
converse
about
their
deeds
the
past
which
they
recounted
with
the
half
bashful
pride
men
who
had
done
good
and
unselfish
service
for
the
community
they
were
reticent
however
the
immediate
job
hand
they
chose
because
neither
nor
the
boy
here
drink
lawler
explained
they
can
count
saying
more
than
should
you
must
not
take
amiss
but
the
orders
the
county
delegate
that
obey
sure
are
all
together
said
scanlan
mcmurdo
mate
the
four
sat
together
supper
that
true
enough
and
talk
till
the
cows
come
home
the
killing
charlie
williams
simon
bird
any
other
job
the
past
but
till
the
work
done
say
nothing
there
are
half
dozen
about
here
that
have
word
say
said
mcmurdo
with
oath
suppose
isn
jack
knox
ironhill
that
you
are
after
some
way
see
him
get
his
deserts
not
him
yet
herman
strauss
nor
him
either
well
you
won
tell
can
make
you
but
glad
know
lawler
smiled
and
shook
his
head
was
not
drawn
spite
the
reticence
their
guests
scanlan
and
mcmurdo
were
quite
determined
present
what
they
called
the
fun
when
therefore
early
hour
one
morning
mcmurdo
heard
them
creeping
down
the
stairs
awakened
scanlan
and
the
two
hurried
their
clothes
when
they
were
dressed
they
found
that
the
others
had
stolen
out
leaving
the
door
open
behind
them
was
not
yet
dawn
and
the
light
the
lamps
they
could
see
the
two
men
some
distance
down
the
street
they
followed
them
warily
treading
noiselessly
the
deep
snow
the
boarding
house
was
near
the
edge
the
town
and
soon
they
were
the
crossroads
which
beyond
its
boundary
here
three
men
were
waiting
with
whom
lawler
and
andrews
held
short
eager
conversation
then
they
all
moved
together
was
clearly
some
notable
job
which
needed
numbers
this
point
there
are
several
trails
which
lead
various
mines
the
strangers
took
that
which
led
the
crow
hill
huge
business
which
was
strong
hands
which
had
been
able
thanks
their
energetic
and
fearless
new
england
manager
josiah
dunn
keep
some
order
and
discipline
during
the
long
reign
terror
day
was
breaking
now
and
line
workmen
were
slowly
making
their
way
singly
and
groups
along
the
blackened
path
mcmurdo
and
scanlan
strolled
with
the
others
keeping
sight
the
men
whom
they
followed
thick
mist
lay
over
them
and
from
the
heart
there
came
the
sudden
scream
steam
whistle
was
the
ten
minute
signal
before
the
cages
descended
and
the
day
labour
began
when
they
reached
the
open
space
round
the
mine
shaft
there
were
hundred
miners
waiting
stamping
their
feet
and
blowing
their
fingers
for
was
bitterly
cold
the
strangers
stood
little
group
under
the
shadow
the
engine
house
scanlan
and
mcmurdo
climbed
heap
slag
from
which
the
whole
scene
lay
before
them
they
saw
the
mine
engineer
great
bearded
scotchman
named
menzies
come
out
the
engine
house
and
blow
his
whistle
for
the
cages
lowered
the
same
instant
tall
loose
framed
young
man
with
clean
shaved
earnest
face
advanced
eagerly
towards
the
pit
head
came
forward
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
group
silent
and
motionless
under
the
engine
house
the
men
had
drawn
down
their
hats
and
turned
their
collars
screen
their
faces
for
moment
the
presentiment
death
laid
its
cold
hand
upon
the
manager
heart
the
next
had
shaken
off
and
saw
only
his
duty
towards
intrusive
strangers
who
are
you
asked
advanced
what
are
you
loitering
there
for
there
was
answer
but
the
lad
andrews
stepped
forward
and
shot
him
the
stomach
the
hundred
waiting
miners
stood
motionless
and
helpless
they
were
paralyzed
the
manager
clapped
his
two
hands
the
wound
and
doubled
himself
then
staggered
away
but
another
the
assassins
fired
and
went
down
sidewise
kicking
and
clawing
among
heap
clinkers
menzies
the
scotchman
gave
roar
rage
the
sight
and
rushed
with
iron
spanner
the
murderers
but
was
met
two
balls
the
face
which
dropped
him
dead
their
very
feet
there
was
surge
forward
some
the
miners
and
inarticulate
cry
pity
and
anger
but
couple
the
strangers
emptied
their
six
shooters
over
the
heads
the
crowd
and
they
broke
and
scattered
some
them
rushing
wildly
back
their
homes
vermissa
when
few
the
bravest
had
rallied
and
there
was
return
the
mine
the
murderous
gang
had
vanished
the
mists
morning
without
single
witness
being
able
swear
the
identity
these
men
who
front
hundred
spectators
had
wrought
this
double
crime
scanlan
and
mcmurdo
made
their
way
back
scanlan
somewhat
subdued
for
was
the
first
murder
job
that
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
and
appeared
less
funny
than
had
been
led
believe
the
horrible
screams
the
dead
manager
wife
pursued
them
they
hurried
the
town
mcmurdo
was
absorbed
and
silent
but
showed
sympathy
for
the
weakening
his
companion
sure
like
war
repeated
what
but
war
between
and
them
and
hit
back
where
best
can
there
was
high
revel
the
lodge
room
the
union
house
that
night
not
only
over
the
killing
the
manager
and
engineer
the
crow
hill
mine
which
would
bring
this
organization
into
line
with
the
other
blackmailed
and
terror
stricken
companies
the
district
but
also
over
distant
triumph
which
had
been
wrought
the
hands
the
lodge
itself
would
appear
that
when
the
county
delegate
had
sent
over
five
good
men
strike
blow
vermissa
had
demanded
that
return
three
vermissa

however
upon

face
and
glazed
bloodshot
eyes
told
sleeplessness
and
drink
and
his
two
comrades
had
spent
the
night
before
among
the
mountains
they
were
unkempt
and
weather
stained
but
heroes
returning
from
forlorn
hope
could
have
had
warmer
welcome
from
their
comrades
the
story
was
told
and
retold
amid
cries
delight
and
shouts
laughter
they
had
waited
for
their
man
drove
home
nightfall
taking
their
station
the
top
steep
hill
where
his
horse
must
walk
was
furred
keep
out
the
cold
that
could
not
lay
his
hand
his
pistol
they
had
pulled
him
out
and
shot
him
again
and
again
had
screamed
for
mercy
the
screams
were
repeated
for
the
amusement
the
lodge
let
hear
again
how
squealed
they
cried
none
them
knew
the
man
but
there
eternal
drama
killing
and
they
had
shown
the
scowrers
gilmerton
that
the
vermissa
men
were
relied
upon
there
had
been
one
contretemps
for
man
and
his
wife
had
driven
while
they
were
still
emptying
their
revolvers
into
the
silent
body
had
been
suggested
that
they
should
shoot
them
both
but
they
were
harmless
folk
who
were
not
connected
with
the
mines
they
were
sternly
bidden
drive
and
keep
silent
lest
worse
thing
befall
them
and
the
blood
mottled
figure
had
been
left
warning
all
such
hard
hearted
employers
and
the
three
noble
avengers
had
hurried
off
into
the
mountains
where
unbroken
nature
comes
down
the
very
edge
the
furnaces
and
the
slag
heaps
here
they
were
safe
and
sound
their
work
well
done
and
the
plaudits
their
companions
their
ears
had
been
great
day
for
the
scowrers
the
shadow
had
fallen
even
darker
over
the
valley
but
the
wise
general
chooses
the
moment
victory
which
redouble
his
efforts
that
his
foes
may
have
time
steady
themselves
after
disaster
boss
mcginty
looking
out
upon
the
scene
his
operations
with
his
brooding
and
malicious
eyes
had
devised
new
attack
upon
those
who
opposed
him
that
very
night
the
half
drunken
company
broke
touched
mcmurdo

great
day
when
you
bring
the
news
just
the
last
stroke
that
will
bring
them
all
their
knees
mcmurdo
thought
long
and
deeply
over
the
commission
which
had
been
suddenly
placed
his
hands
the
isolated
house
which
chester
wilcox
lived
was
about
five
miles
off
adjacent
valley
that
very
night
started
off
all
alone
prepare
for
the
attempt
was
daylight
before
returned
from
his
reconnaissance
next
day
interviewed
his
two
subordinates
manders
and
reilly
reckless
youngsters
who
were
elated
were
deer
hunt
two
nights
later
they
met
outside
the
town
all
three
armed
and
one
them
carrying
sack
stuffed
with
the
powder
which
was
used
the
quarries
was
two
the
morning
before
they
came
the
lonely
house
the
night
was
windy
one
with
broken
clouds
drifting
swiftly
across
the
face
three
quarter
moon
they
had
been
warned
their
guard
against
bloodhounds
they
moved
forward
cautiously
with
their
pistols
cocked
their
hands
but
there
was
sound
save
the
howling
the
wind
and
movement
but
the
swaying
branches
above
them
mcmurdo
listened
the
door
the
lonely
house
but
all
was
still
within
then
leaned
the
powder
bag
against
ripped
hole
with
his
knife
and
attached
the
fuse
when
was
well
alight
and
his
two
companions
took
their
heels
and
were
some
distance
off
safe
and
snug
sheltering
ditch
before
the
shattering
roar
the
explosion
with
the
low
deep
rumble
the
collapsing
building
told
them
that
their
work
was
done
cleaner
job
had
ever
been
carried
out
the
bloodstained
annals
the
society
but
alas
that
work
well
organized
and
boldly
carried
out
should
all
have
gone
for
nothing
warned
the
fate
the
various
victims
and
knowing
that
was
marked
down
for
destruction
chester
wilcox
had
moved
himself
and
his
family
only
the
day
before
some
safer
and
less
known
quarters
where
guard
police
should
watch
over
them
was
empty
house
which
had
been
torn
down
the
gunpowder
and
the
grim
old
colour
sergeant
the
war
was
still
teaching
discipline
the
miners
iron
dike
leave
him
said
mcmurdo
man
and
get
him
sure
have
wait
year
for
him
vote
thanks
and
confidence
was
passed
full
lodge
and
for
the
time
the
matter
ended
when
few
weeks
later
was
reported
the
papers
that
wilcox
had
been
shot
from
ambuscade
was
open
secret
that
mcmurdo
was
still
work
upon
his
unfinished
job
such
were
the
methods
the
society
freemen
and
such
were
the
deeds
the
scowrers
which
they
spread
their
rule
fear
over
the
great
and
rich
district
which
was
for
long
period
haunted
their
terrible
presence
why
should
these
pages
stained
further
crimes
have
not
said
enough
show
the
men
and
their
methods
these
deeds
are
written
history
and
there
are
records
wherein
one
may
read
the
details
them
there
one
may
learn
the
shooting
policemen
hunt
and
evans
because
they
had
ventured
arrest
two
members
the
society
double
outrage
planned
the
vermissa
lodge
and
carried
out
cold
blood
upon
two
helpless
and
disarmed
men
there
also
one
may
read
the
shooting
mrs
larbey
when
she
was
nursing
her
husband
who
had
been
beaten
almost
death
orders
boss
mcginty
the
killing
the
elder
jenkins
shortly
followed
that
his
brother
the
mutilation
james
murdoch
the
blowing
the
staphouse
family
and
the
murder
the
stendals
all
followed
hard
upon
one
another
the
same
terrible
winter
darkly
the
shadow
lay
upon
the
valley
fear
the
spring
had
come
with
running
brooks
and
blossoming
trees
there
was
hope
for
all
nature
bound
long
iron
grip
but
nowhere
was
there
any
hope
for
the
men
and
women
who
lived
under
the
yoke
the
terror
never
had
the
cloud
above
them
been
dark
and
hopeless
the
early
summer
the
year
chapter
danger
was
the
height
the
reign
terror
mcmurdo
who
had
already
been
appointed
inner
deacon
with
every
prospect
some
day
succeeding
mcginty
bodymaster
was
now
necessary
the
councils
his
comrades
that
nothing
was
done
without
his
help
and
advice
the
more
popular
became
however
with
the
freemen
the
blacker
were
the
scowls
which
greeted
him
passed
along
the
streets
vermissa
spite
their
terror
the
citizens
were
taking
heart
band
themselves
together
against
their
oppressors
rumours
had
reached
the
lodge
secret
gatherings
the
herald
office
and
distribution
firearms
among
the
law
abiding
people
but
mcginty
and
his
men
were
undisturbed
such
reports
they
were
numerous
resolute
and
well
armed
their
opponents
were
scattered
and
powerless
would
all
end
had
done
the
past
aimless
talk
and
possibly
impotent
arrests
said
mcginty
mcmurdo
and
all
the
bolder
spirits
was
saturday

creased
with
care
and
his
kindly
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
can
speak
with
you
freely
mcmurdo
sure
can
forget
that
spoke
heart

once
and
that
you
kept
yourself

the
boss

came

you
about
what
else

danger
and
the
need
for

gripped
morris
shoulder
and
shook
him
his
earnestness
see

cried
and
almost
screeched
the
words

anything
sitting
keening
like

let
have
the
facts
who

you
come

for
you
are
the
one
man
that
would
advise
told
you
that

east
before
came
here
left
good
friends
behind
and
one
them
the
telegraph
service
here
letter
that
had
from
him
yesterday
this
part
from
the
top
the
page
you
can
read
yourself
this
was
what
mcmurdo
read
how
are
the
scowrers
getting
your
parts
read
plenty
them
the
papers
between
you
and
expect
hear
news
from
you
before
long
five
big
corporations
and
the
two
railroads
have
taken
the
thing
dead
earnest
they
mean
and
you
can
bet
they
get
there
they
are
right
deep
down
into
pinkerton
has
taken
hold
under
their
orders
and
his
best
man
birdy
edwards
operating
the
thing
has
got
stopped
right
now
now
read
the
postscript
course
what
give
you
what
learned
business
goes
further
queer
cipher
that
you
handle
the
yard
every
day
and
can
get
meaning
from
mcmurdo
sat
silence
for
some
time
with
the
letter
his
listless
hands
the
mist
had
lifted
for
moment
and
there
was
the
abyss
before
him
does
anyone
else
know
this
asked
have
told
one
else
but
this
man
your
friend
has
any
other
person
that
would
likely
write
well
dare
say
knows
one
two
more
the
lodge
likely
enough
was
asking
because
likely
that
may
have
given
some
description
this
fellow
birdy
edwards
then
could
get
his
trail
well
possible
but
should
not
think
knew
him
just
telling
the
news
that
came
him
way
business
how
would
know
this
pinkerton
man
mcmurdo
gave
violent
start
gar
cried
got
him
what
fool
was
not
know
lord
but
luck
will
fix
him
before
can
any
harm
see
here
morris
will
you
leave
this
thing
hands
sure
you
will
only
take
off
mine
that
you
can
stand
right
back
and
let
run
even
your
name
need
not
mentioned
take
all
myself
were
that
this
letter
has
come
will
that
content
you
just
what
would
ask
then
leave
that
and
keep
your
head
shut
now
get
down
the
lodge
and
soon
make
old
man
pinkerton
sorry
for
himself
you
wouldn
kill
this
man
the
less
you
know
friend
morris
the
easier
your
conscience
will
and
the
better
you
will
sleep
ask
questions
and
let
these
things
settle
themselves
have
hold
now
morris
shook
his
head
sadly
left
feel
that
his
blood
hands
groaned
self
protection
murder
anyhow
said
mcmurdo
smiling
grimly
him
guess
this
man
would
destroy
all
left
him
long
the
valley
why
brother
morris
have
elect
you
bodymaster
yet
for
you
surely
saved
the
lodge
and
yet
was
clear
from
his
actions
that
thought
more
seriously
this
new
intrusion
than
his
words
would
show
may
have
been
his
guilty
conscience
may
have
been
the
reputation
the
pinkerton
organization
may
have
been
the
knowledge
that
great
rich
corporations
had
set
themselves
the
task
clearing
out
the
scowrers
but
whatever
his
reason
his
actions
were
those
man
who
preparing
for
the
worst
every
paper
which
would
incriminate
him
was
destroyed
before
left
the
house
after
that
gave
long
sigh
satisfaction
for
seemed
him
that
was
safe
and
yet
the
danger
must
still
have
pressed
somewhat
upon
him
for
his
way
the
lodge
stopped
old
man
shafter
the
house
was
forbidden
him
but
when

baldwin
mcmurdo
nodded
good
for
you
brother
baldwin
said
you
and
have
had
our
differences
but
you
have
said
the
true
word
night
where
then
where

him
eminent
bodymaster
said
mcmurdo
earnestly
would
put
you
that
this
too
vital
thing
for
discuss
open
lodge
god
forbid
that
should
throw
doubt
anyone
here
but
much
word
gossip
got
the
ears
this
man
there
would
end
any
chance
our
getting
him
would
ask
the
lodge
choose
trusty
committee
chairman
yourself
might
suggest
and
brother
baldwin
here
and
five
more
then
can
talk
freely

what
advise

done
the
proposition
was
once
adopted
and
the
committee
chosen
besides
the
chairman
and
baldwin
there
were
the
vulture
faced
secretary
harraway
tiger
cormac
the
brutal
young
assassin
carter
the
treasurer
and
the
brothers
willaby
fearless
and
desperate
men
who
would
stick
nothing
the
usual
revelry
the
lodge
was
short
and
subdued
for
there
was
cloud
upon
the
men
spirits
and
many
there
for
the
first
time
began
see
the
cloud
avenging
law
drifting
that
serene
sky
under
which
they
had
dwelt
long
the
horrors
they
had
dealt
out
others
had
been
much
part
their
settled
lives
that
the
thought
retribution
had
become
remote
one
and
seemed
the
more
startling
now
that
came
closely
upon
them
they
broke
early
and
left
their
leaders
their
council
now
mcmurdo
said
mcginty
when
they
were
alone
the
seven
men
sat
frozen
their
seats
said
just
now
that

mcmurdo
explained

the

scared
that

what
the

time

mcginty

and
you

rest
with
chapter
the
trapping
birdy
edwards
mcmurdo
had
said
the
house
which
lived
was
lonely
one
and
very
well
suited
for
such
crime
they
had
planned
was
the
extreme
fringe
the
town
and
stood
well
back
from
the
road
any
other
case
the
conspirators
would
have
simply
called
out
their
man
they
had
many
time
before
and
emptied
their
pistols
into
his
body
but
this
instance
was
very
necessary
find
out
how
much
knew
how
knew
and
what
had
been
passed
his
employers
was
possible
that
they
were
already
too
late
and
that
the
work
had
been
done
that
was
indeed
they
could
least
have
their
revenge
upon
the
man
who
had
done
but
they
were
hopeful
that
nothing
great
importance
had
yet
come
the
detective
knowledge
otherwise
they
argued
would
not
have
troubled
write
down
and
forward
such
trivial
information
mcmurdo
claimed
have
given
him
however
all
this
they
would
learn
from
his
own
lips
once
their
power
they
would
find
way
make
him
speak
was
not
the
first
time
that
they
had
handled
unwilling
witness
mcmurdo
went
hobson
patch
agreed
the
police
seemed
take
particular
interest
him
that
morning
and
captain
marvin
who
had
claimed
the
old
acquaintance
with
him
chicago
actually
addressed
him
waited
the
station
mcmurdo
turned
away
and
refused
speak
with
him
was
back
from
his
mission
the
afternoon
and
saw
mcginty
the
union
house
coming
said
good
said
mcginty
the
giant
was
his
shirt
sleeves
with
chains
and
seals
gleaming
athwart
his
ample
waistcoat
and
diamond
twinkling
through
the
fringe
his
bristling
beard
drink
and
politics
had
made
the
boss
very
rich
well
powerful
man
the
more
terrible
therefore
seemed
that
glimpse
the
prison
the
gallows
which
had
risen
before
him
the
night
before
you
reckon
knows
much
asked
anxiously
mcmurdo
shook
his
head
gloomily
been
here
some
time
six
weeks
the
least
guess
didn
come
into
these
parts
look
the
prospect
has
been
working
among
all
that
time
with
the
railroad
money
his
back
should
expect
that
has
got
results
and
that
has
passed
them
there
not
weak
man
the
lodge
cried
mcginty
true
steel
every
man
them
and
yet
the
lord
there
that
skunk
morris
what
about
him
any
man
gives
away
would
mind
send
couple
the
boys
round
before
evening
give
him
beating
and
see
what
they
can
get
from
him
well
there
would
harm
that
mcmurdo
answered
won
deny
that
have
liking
for
morris
and
would
sorry
see
him
come
harm
has
spoken
once
twice
over
lodge
matters
and
though
may
not
see
them
the
same
you
never
seemed
the
sort
that
squeals
but
still
not
for
stand
between
him
and
you
fix
the
old
devil
said
mcginty
with
oath
had
eye
him
this
year
past
well
you
know
best
about
that
mcmurdo
answered
but
whatever
you
must
morrow
for
must
lie
low
until
the
pinkerton
affair
settled
can
afford
set
the
police
buzzing
day
all
days
true
for
you
said
mcginty
and
learn
from
birdy
edwards
himself
where
got
his
news
have
cut
his
heart
out
first
did
seem
scent
trap
mcmurdo
laughed
guess
took
him
his
weak
point
said
could
get
good
trail
the
scowrers
ready
follow
into
hell
took
his
money
mcmurdo
grinned
produced
wad
dollar
notes
and
much
more
when
has
seen
all
papers
what
papers
well
there
are
papers
but
filled
him
about
constitutions
and
books
rules
and
forms
membership
expects
get
right
down
the
end
everything
before
leaves
faith
right
there
said
mcginty
grimly
didn
ask
you
why
you
didn
bring
him
the
papers
would
carry
such
things
and
suspected
man
and
captain
marvin
after
speaking
this
very
day
the
depot
heard
that
said
mcginty
guess
the
heavy
end
this
business
coming
you
could
put
him
down
old
shaft
when
done
with
him
but
however
work
can
get
past
the
man
living
hobson
patch
and
you
being
there
day
mcmurdo
shrugged
his
shoulders
handle
right
they
can
never
prove
the
killing
said
one
can
see
him
come
the
house
after
dark
and
lay
that
one
will
see
him
now
see
here
councillor
show
you
plan
and
ask
you
fit
the
others
into
you
will
all
come
good
time
very
well
comes
ten
tap
three
times
and
open
the
door
for
him
then
get
behind
him
and
shut
our
man
then
that
all
easy
and
plain
yes
but
the
next
step
wants
considering
hard
proposition
heavily
armed
fooled
him
proper
and
yet
likely
his
guard
suppose
show
him
right
into
room
with
seven
men
where
expected
find
alone
there
going
shooting
and
somebody
going
hurt
that
and
the
noise
going
bring
every
damned
copper
the
township
top
guess
you
are
right
this
how
should
work
you
will
all
the
big
room
same
you
saw
when
you
had
chat
with
open
the
door
for
him
show
him
into
the
parlour
beside
the
door
and
leave
him
there
while
get
the
papers
that
will
give
the
chance
telling
you
how
things
are
shaping
then
will
back
him
with
some
faked
papers
reading
them
will
jump
for
him
and
get
grip
his
pistol
arm
you
hear
call
and
you
will
rush
the
quicker
the
better
for
strong
man
and
may
have
more
than
can
manage
but
allow
that
can
hold
him
till
you
come
good
plan
said
mcginty
the
lodge
will
owe
you
debt
for
this
guess
when
move
out
the
chair
can
put
name
the
man
that
coming
after
sure
councillor
little
more
than
recruit
said
mcmurdo
but
his
face
showed
what
thought
the
great
man
compliment
when
had
returned
home
made
his
own
preparations
for
the
grim
evening
front
him
first
cleaned
oiled
and
loaded
his
smith
wesson
revolver
then
surveyed
the
room
which
the
detective
was
trapped
was
large
apartment
with
long
deal
table
the
centre
and
the
big
stove
one
side
each
the
other
sides
were
windows
there
were
shutters
these
only
light
curtains
which
drew
across
mcmurdo
examined
these
attentively
doubt
must
have
struck
him
that
the
apartment
was
very
exposed
for
secret
meeting
yet
its
distance
from
the
road
made
less
consequence
finally
discussed
the
matter
with
his
fellow
lodger
scanlan
though
scowrer
was
inoffensive
little
man
who
was
too
weak
stand
against
the
opinion
his
comrades
but
was
secretly
horrified
the
deeds
blood
which
had
sometimes
been
forced
assist
mcmurdo
told
him
shortly
what
was
intended
and
were
you
mike
scanlan
would
take
night
off
and
keep
clear
there
will
bloody
work
here
before
morning
well
indeed
then
mac
scanlan
answered
not
the
will
but
the
nerve
that
wanting
when
saw
manager
dunn
down
the
colliery
yonder
was
just
more
than
could
stand
not
made
for
same
you
mcginty
the
lodge
will
think
none
the
worse
just
you
advise
and
leave
you
yourselves
for
the
evening
the
men
came
good
time
arranged
they
were
outwardly
respectable
citizens
well
clad
and
cleanly
but
judge
faces
would
have
read
little
hope
for
birdy
edwards
those
hard
mouths
and
remorseless
eyes
there
was
not
man
the
room
whose
hands
had
not
been
reddened
dozen
times
before
they
were
hardened
human
murder
butcher
sheep
foremost
course
both
appearance
and
guilt
was
the
formidable
boss
harraway
the
secretary
was
lean
bitter
man
with
long
scraggy
neck
and
nervous
jerky
limbs
man
incorruptible
fidelity
where
the
finances
the
order
were
concerned
and
with
notion
justice
honesty
anyone
beyond
the
treasurer
carter
was
middle
aged
man
with
impassive
rather
sulky
expression
and
yellow
parchment
skin
was
capable
organizer
and
the
actual
details
nearly
every
outrage
had
sprung
from
his
plotting
brain
the
two
willabys
were
men
action
tall
lithe
young
fellows
with
determined
faces
while
their
companion
tiger
cormac
heavy
dark
youth
was
feared
even
his
own
comrades
for
the
ferocity
his
disposition
these
were
the
men
who
assembled
that
night
under
the
roof
mcmurdo
for
the
killing
the
pinkerton
detective
their
host
had
placed
whisky
upon
the
table
and
they
had
hastened
prime
themselves
for
the
work
before
them
baldwin
and
cormac
were
already
half
drunk
and
the
liquor
had
brought
out
all
their
ferocity
cormac
placed
his
hands
the
stove
for
instant
had
been
lighted
for
the
nights
were
still
cold
that
will
said
with
oath
said
baldwin
catching
his
meaning
strapped
that
will
have
the
truth
out
him
have
the
truth
out
him
never
fear
said
mcmurdo
had
nerves
steel
this
man
for
though
the
whole
weight
the
affair
was
him
his
manner
was
cool
and
unconcerned
ever
the
others
marked
and
applauded
you
are
the
one
handle
him
said
the
boss
approvingly
not
warning
will
get
till
your
hand
his
throat
pity
there
are
shutters
your
windows
mcmurdo
went
from
one
the
other
and
drew
the
curtains
tighter
sure
one
can
spy
upon
now
close
upon
the
hour
maybe
won
come
maybe
get
sniff
danger
said
the
secretary
come
never
fear
mcmurdo
answered
eager
come
you
can
see
him
hark
that
they
all
sat
like
wax
figures
some
with
their
glasses
arrested
halfway
their
lips
three
loud
knocks
had
sounded
the
door
hush
mcmurdo
raised
his
hand
caution
exulting
glance
went
round
the
circle
and
hands
were
laid
upon
their
weapons
not
sound
for
your
lives
mcmurdo
whispered
went
from
the
room
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
with
strained
ears
the
murderers
waited
they
counted
the
steps
their
comrade
down
the
passage
then
they
heard
him
open
the
outer
door
there
were
few
words
greeting
then
they
were
aware
strange
step
inside
and
unfamiliar
voice
instant
later
came
the
slam
the
door
and
the
turning
the
key
the
lock
their
prey
was
safe
within
the
trap
tiger
cormac
laughed
horribly
and
boss
mcginty
clapped
his
great
hand
across
his
mouth
quiet
you
fool
whispered
you
the
undoing
yet
there
was
mutter
conversation
from
the
next
room
seemed
interminable
then
the
door
opened
and
mcmurdo
appeared
his
finger
upon
his
lip
came
the
end
the
table
and
looked
round
them
subtle
change
had
come
over
him
his
manner
was
one
who
has
great
work
his
face
had
set
into
granite
firmness
his
eyes
shone
with
fierce
excitement
behind
his
spectacles
had
become
visible
leader
men
they
stared
him
with
eager
interest
but
said
nothing
still
with
the
same
singular
gaze
looked
from
man
man
well
cried
boss
mcginty
last
here
birdy
edwards
here
yes
mcmurdo
answered
slowly
birdy
edwards
here
birdy
edwards
there
were
ten
seconds
after
that
brief
speech
during
which
the
room
might
have
been
empty
profound
was
the
silence
the
hissing
kettle
upon
the
stove
rose
sharp
and
strident
the
ear
seven
white
faces
all
turned
upward
this
man
who
dominated
them
were
set
motionless
with
utter
terror
then
with
sudden
shivering
glass
bristle
glistening
rifle
barrels
broke
through
each
window
while
the
curtains
were
torn
from
their
hangings
the
sight
boss
mcginty
gave
the
roar
wounded
bear
and
plunged
for
the
half
opened
door
levelled
revolver
met
him
there
with
the
stern
blue
eyes
captain
marvin
the
mine
police
gleaming
behind
the
sights
the
boss
recoiled
and
fell
back
into
his
chair
you
safer
there
councillor
said
the
man
whom
they
had
known
mcmurdo
and
you
baldwin
you
don
take
your
hand
off
your
pistol
you
cheat
the
hangman
yet
pull
out
the
lord
that
made
there
that
will
there
are
forty
armed
men
round
this
house
and
you
can
figure
out
for
yourself
what
chance
you
have
take
their
pistols
marvin
there
was
possible
resistance
under
the
menace
those
rifles
the
men
were
disarmed
sulky
sheepish
and
amazed
they
still
sat
round
the
table
like
say
word
you
before
separate
said
the
man
who
had
trapped
them
guess
may
not
meet
again
until
you
see
the
stand
the
courthouse
give
you
something
think
over
between
now
and
then
you
know
now
for
what
last
can
put
cards
the
table
birdy
edwards
pinkerton
was
chosen
break
your
gang
had
hard
and
dangerous
game
play
not
soul
not
one
soul
not
nearest
and
dearest
knew
that
was
playing
only
captain
marvin
here
and
employers
knew
that
but
over
night
thank
god
and
the
winner
the
seven
pale
rigid
faces
looked
him
there
was
unappeasable
hatred
their
eyes
read
the
relentless
threat
maybe
you
think
that
the
game
not
over
yet
well
take
chance
that
anyhow
some
you
will
take
further
hand
and
there
are
sixty
more
besides
yourselves
that
will
see
jail
this
night
tell
you
this
that
when
was
put
upon
this
job
never
believed
there
was
such
society
yours
thought
was
paper
talk
and
that
would
prove
they
told
was
with
the
freemen
went
chicago
and
was
made
one
then
was
surer
than
ever
that
was
just
paper
talk
for
found
harm
the
society
but
deal
good
still
had
carry
out
job
and
came
the
coal
valleys
when
reached
this
place
learned
that
was
wrong
and
that
wasn
dime
novel
after
all
stayed
look
after
never
killed
man
chicago
never
minted
dollar
life
those
gave
you
were
good
any
others
but
never
spent
money
better
but
knew
the
way
into
your
good
wishes
and
pretended
you
that
the
law
was
after
all
worked
just
thought
joined
your
infernal
lodge
and
took
share
your
councils
maybe
they
will
say
that
was
bad
you
they
can
say
what
they
like
long
get
you
but
what
the
truth
the
night
joined
you
beat
old
man
stanger
could
not
warn
him
for
there
was
time
but
held
your
hand
baldwin
when
you
would
have
killed
him
ever
have
suggested
things
keep
place
among
you
they
were
things
which
knew
could
prevent
could
not
save
dunn
and
menzies
for
did
not
know
enough
but
will
see
that
their
murderers

chester
wilcox
warning
that
when
blew
his
house
and
his
folk
were
hiding
there
was
many
crime
that
could
not
stop
but
you
look
back
and
think
how
often
your
man
came
home
the
other
road
was
down
town
when
you
went
for
him
stayed
indoors
when
you
thought
would
come
out

mcginty
through
his
closed
teeth

your
grip
there

just
one
way

seriousness
deviltry
watson

long
with
clouded
brow
late
last
night
