she
added
becoming
calm
again
expecting
two
very
interesting
men
tonight
vicomte
mortemart
who
connected
with
the
montmorencys
through
the
rohans
one
the
best
french
families
one
the
genuine
emigres
the
good
ones
and
also
the
abbe
morio
you
know
that
profound
thinker
has
been
received
the
emperor
had
you
heard
shall
delighted
meet
them
said
the
prince
but
tell
added
with
studied
carelessness
had
only
just
occurred
him
though
the
question
was
about
ask
was
the
chief
motive
his
visit
true
that
the
dowager
empress
wants
baron
funke
appointed
first
secretary
vienna
the
baron
all
accounts
poor
creature
prince
vasili
wished
obtain
this
post
for
his
son
but
others
were
trying
through
the
dowager
empress
marya
fedorovna
secure
for
the
baron
anna
pavlovna
almost
closed
her
eyes
indicate
that
neither
she
nor
anyone
else
had
right
criticize
what
the
empress
desired
was
pleased
with
baron
funke
has
been
recommended
the
dowager
empress
her
sister
was
all
she
said
dry
and
mournful
tone
she
named
the
empress
anna
pavlovna
face
suddenly
assumed
expression
profound
and
sincere
devotion
and
respect
mingled
with
sadness
and
this
occurred
every
time
she
mentioned
her
illustrious
patroness
she
added
that
her
majesty
had
deigned
show
baron
funke
beaucoup
estime
and
again
her
face
clouded
over
with
sadness
the
prince
was
silent
and
looked
indifferent
but
with
the
womanly
and
courtierlike
quickness
and
tact
habitual
her
anna
pavlovna
wished
both
rebuke
him
for
daring
speak
had
done
man
recommended
the
empress
and
the
same
time
console
him
she
said
now
about
your
family
you
know
that
since
your
daughter
came
out
everyone
has
been
enraptured
her
they
say
she
amazingly
beautiful
the
prince
bowed
signify
his
respect
and
gratitude
often
think
she
continued
after
short
pause
drawing
nearer
the
prince
and
smiling
amiably
him
show
that
political
and
social
topics
were
ended
and
the
time
had
come
for
intimate
conversation
often
think
how
unfairly
sometimes
the
joys
life
are
distributed
why
has
fate
given
you
two
such
splendid
children
don
speak
anatole
your
youngest
don
like
him
she
added
tone
admitting
rejoinder
and
raising
her
eyebrows
two
such
charming
children
and
really
you
appreciate
them
less
than
anyone
and
you
don
deserve
have
them
and
she
smiled
her
ecstatic
smile
can
help
said
the
prince
lavater
would
have
said
lack
the
bump
paternity
don
joke
mean
have
serious
talk
with
you
you
know
dissatisfied
with
your
younger
son
between
ourselves
and
her
face
assumed
its
melancholy
expression
was
mentioned
her
majesty
and
you
were
pitied
the
prince
answered
nothing
but
she
looked
him
significantly
awaiting
reply
frowned
what
would
you
have
said
last
you
know
did
all
father
could
for
their
education
and
they
have
both
turned
out
fools
hippolyte
least
quiet
fool
but
anatole
active
one
that
the
only
difference
between
them
said
this
smiling
way
more
natural
and
animated
than
usual
that
the
wrinkles
round
his
mouth
very
clearly
revealed
something
unexpectedly
coarse
and
unpleasant
and
why
are
children
born
such
men
you
you
were
not
father
there
would
nothing
could
reproach
you
with
said
anna
pavlovna
looking
pensively
your
faithful
slave
and
you
alone
can
confess
that
children
are
the
bane
life
the
cross
have
bear
that
how
explain
myself
can
helped
said
more
but
expressed
his
resignation
cruel
fate
gesture
anna
pavlovna
meditated
have
you
never
thought

your
prodigal

asked

mania
for

the
quickness
memory
and
perception
befitting
man
the
world
indicated
movement
the
head
that
was
considering
this
information
you
know
said
last
evidently
unable
check
the
sad
current
his
thoughts
that
anatole
costing
forty
thousand
rubles
year
and
went
after
pause

little
old

wearing
large

from

with
mournful
and
solemn
interest
and
silent
approval
the
aunt
spoke
each
them
the
same
words
about
their
health
and
her
own
and
the
health
her
majesty
who
thank
god
was
better
today
and
each
visitor
though
politeness
prevented
his
showing
impatience
left
the
old
woman
with
sense
relief
having
performed
vexatious
duty
and
did
not
return
her
the
whole
evening
the
young
princess
bolkonskaya
had
brought
some
work
gold
embroidered
velvet
bag
her
pretty
little
upper
lip
which
delicate
dark
down
was
just
perceptible
was
too
short
for
her
teeth
but
lifted
all
the
more
sweetly
and
was
especially
charming
when
she
occasionally
drew
down
meet
the
lower
lip
always
the
case
with
thoroughly
attractive
woman
her
defect
the
shortness
her
upper
lip
and
her
half
open

her
own
special
and
peculiar
form

everyone
brightened
the
sight
this
pretty
young
woman
soon
become
mother
full
life
and
health
and
carrying
her
burden
lightly
old
men
and
dull
dispirited
young
ones
who
looked
her
after
being
her
company
and
talking
her
little
while
felt
they
too
were
becoming
like
her
full
life
and
health
all
who
talked
her
and
each
word
saw
her
bright
smile
and
the
constant
gleam
her
white
teeth
thought
that
they
were
specially
amiable
mood
that
day
the
little
princess
went
round
the
table
with
quick
short
swaying
steps
her
workbag
her
arm
and
gaily
spreading
out
her
dress
sat
down
sofa
near
the
silver
samovar
all
she
was
doing
was
pleasure
herself
and
all
around

added
turning
her
hostess
you
wrote
that

how
badly

and
she
spread
out
her

girdled
with
broad
ribbon
just
below
the
breast

with
the
nod
she
accorded
the
lowest
hierarchy

but
spite
this
lowest
grade
greeting
look
anxiety
and
fear
the
sight
something
too
large
and
unsuited
the
place
came
over
her
face
when
she
saw
pierre
enter
though
was
certainly
rather
bigger
than
the
other
men
the
room
her
anxiety
could
only
have
reference

observant
and
natural

was
justified
for

turned
away
from

dismay
detained

with
the
words

with
smile
and
having
got
rid
this
young
man
who
did
not
know
how
behave
she
resumed
her
duties

amid

anna

was
full
swing
the
spindles
hummed
steadily
and
ceaselessly
all
sides
with
the
exception
the
aunt
beside
whom
sat
only
one
elderly
lady
who
with
her
thin
careworn
face
was
rather
out

rather
too
plump

age
the
third
group
was
gathered
round
mortemart
and
anna
pavlovna
the
vicomte
was
nice
looking
young
man
with
soft
features
and
polished
manners
who
evidently
considered
himself
celebrity
but
out
politeness
modestly
placed
himself

began
discussing
the

the
vicomte

particular
reasons

said
anna

the
beautiful
young
princess
who
was
sitting
some
way
off
the
center
another
group
the
princess
smiled
she
rose
with
the
same
unchanging
smile
with
which
she
had
first
entered
the
room
the
smile
perfectly
beautiful
woman
with
slight
rustle
her
white
dress
trimmed
with
moss
and
ivy
with
gleam
white
shoulders
glossy
hair
and
sparkling
diamonds
she
passed
between
the
men
who
made
way
for
her
not
looking
any
them
but
smiling
all
graciously
allowing
each
the
privilege
admiring
her
beautiful
figure
and
shapely
shoulders
back
and
bosom
which
the
fashion
those
days
were
very
much
exposed
and
she
seemed
bring
the
glamour
ballroom
with
her
she
moved
toward
anna
pavlovna
helene
was
lovely
that
not
only
did
she
not
show
any
trace
coquetry
but
the
contrary
she
even
appeared
shy
her
unquestionable
and
all
too
victorious
beauty
she
seemed
wish
but
unable
diminish
its
effect
how
lovely
said
everyone
who
saw
her
and
the
vicomte
lifted
his
shoulders
and
dropped
his
eyes
startled
something
extraordinary
when
she
took
her
seat
opposite
and
beamed
upon
him
also
with
her
unchanging
smile
madame
doubt
ability
before
such
audience
said
smilingly
inclining
his
head
the
princess
rested
her
bare
round
arm
little
table
and
considered
reply
unnecessary
she
smilingly
waited
all
the
time
the
story
was
being
told
she
sat
upright
glancing
now
her
beautiful
round
arm
altered
shape
its
pressure
the
table
now
her
still
more
beautiful
bosom
which
she
readjusted
diamond
necklace
from
time
time
she
smoothed
the
folds
her
dress
and
whenever
the
story
produced
effect
she
glanced
anna
pavlovna
once
adopted
just
the
expression
she
saw
the
maid
honor
face
and
again
relapsed
into
her
radiant
smile
the
little
princess
had
also
left
the
tea
table
and
followed
helene
wait
moment
get
work
now
then
what
are
you
thinking
she
went
turning
prince
hippolyte
fetch
workbag
there
was
general
movement
the
princess
smiling
and
talking
merrily
everyone
once
sat
down
and
gaily
arranged
herself
her
seat
now
all
right
she
said
and
asking
the
vicomte
begin
she
took
her
work
prince
hippolyte
having
brought
the
workbag
joined
the
circle
and
moving
chair
close
hers
seated
himself
beside
her
charmant
hippolyte
was
surprising
his
extraordinary
resemblance
his
beautiful
sister
but
yet
more
the
fact
that
spite
this
resemblance
was
exceedingly
ugly
his
features
were
like
his
sister
but
while
her
case
everything
was
lit
joyous
self
satisfied
youthful
and
constant
smile
animation
and
the
wonderful
classic
beauty
her
figure
his
face
the
contrary
was
dulled
imbecility
and
constant
expression
sullen
self
confidence
while
his
body
was
thin
and
weak
his
eyes
nose
and
mouth
all
seemed
puckered
into
vacant
wearied
grimace
and
his
arms
and
legs
always
fell
into
unnatural
positions
not
going
ghost
story
said
sitting
down
beside
the
princess
and
hastily
adjusting
his
lorgnette
without
this
instrument
could
not
begin
speak
why
dear
fellow
said
the
astonished
narrator
shrugging
his
shoulders
because
hate
ghost
stories
said
prince
hippolyte
tone
which
showed
that
only
understood
the
meaning
his
words
after
had
uttered
them
spoke
with
such
self
confidence
that
his
hearers
could
not
sure
whether
what
said
was
very
witty
very
stupid
was
dressed
dark
green

coat
knee
breeches
the
color
cuisse
nymphe
effrayee
called
shoes
and
silk
stockings
the
vicomte
told
his
tale
very
neatly
was
anecdote
then
current
the
effect
that
the
duc
enghien
had
gone
secretly
paris
visit
mademoiselle
george
that
her
house
came
upon
bonaparte
who
also
enjoyed
the
famous
actress
favors
and
that
his
presence
napoleon
happened
fall
into
one
the
fainting
fits
which
was
subject
and
was
thus
the
duc
mercy
the
latter
spared
him
and
this
magnanimity
bonaparte
subsequently
repaid
death
the
story
was
very
pretty
and
interesting
especially
the
point
where
the
rivals
suddenly
recognized
one
another
and
the
ladies
looked
agitated
charming
said
anna
pavlovna
with
inquiring
glance
the
little
princess
charming
whispered
the
little
princess
sticking
the
needle
into
her
work
testify
that
the
interest
and
fascination
the
story
prevented
her
from
going
with
the
vicomte
appreciated
this
silent
praise
and
smiling
gratefully
prepared
continue
but
just
then
anna
pavlovna
who
had
kept
watchful
eye
the
young
man
who
alarmed
her
noticed
that
was
talking
too
loudly
and
vehemently
with
the
abbe
she
hurried
the
rescue
pierre
had
managed
start
conversation
with
the
abbe
about
the
balance
power
and
the
latter
evidently
interested
the
young
man
simple
minded
eagerness
was
explaining
his
pet
theory
both
were
talking
and
listening
too
eagerly
and
too
naturally
which
was
why
anna
pavlovna
disapproved
the
means
are
the
balance
power
europe
and
the
rights
the
people
the
abbe
was
saying
only
necessary
for
one
powerful
nation
like
russia
barbaric
she
said
place
herself
disinterestedly
the
head
alliance
having
for
its
object
the
maintenance
the
balance
power
europe
and
would
save
the
world
but
how
are
you
get
that
balance
pierre
was
beginning
that
moment
anna
pavlovna
came
and
looking
severely
pierre
asked
the
italian
how
stood
russian
climate
the
italian
face
instantly
changed
and
assumed
offensively
affected
sugary
expression
evidently
habitual
him
when
conversing
with
women
enchanted
the
brilliancy
the
wit
and
culture
the
society
more
especially
the
feminine
society
which
have
had
the
honor
being
received
that
have
not
yet
had
time
think
the
climate
said
not
letting
the
abbe
and
pierre
escape
anna
pavlovna
the
more
conveniently
keep
them
under
observation

them
into
the
larger
circle

then
another
visitor
entered
the
drawing
room

andrew
bolkonski
the
little
princess

was
very
handsome
young
man
medium
height
with
firm
clearcut
features
everything
about
him
from
his
weary
bored
expression
his
quiet
measured
step
offered
most
striking
contrast
his
quiet
little
wife
was
evident
that
not
only
knew
everyone
the
drawing
room
but
had
found
them
tiresome
that
wearied
him
look
listen
them
and
among
all
these
faces
that
found
tedious
none
seemed
bore
him
much
that
his
pretty
wife
turned
away
from
her
with
grimace
that
distorted
his
handsome
face
kissed
anna
pavlovna

and
screwing
his
eyes
scanned
the
whole
company

his

addressing
her
husband

same
coquettish
manner
which
she
spoke
other
men

been
telling
such

and
turned
away

who
from
the
moment
prince
andrew
entered
the
room
had
watched
him
with
glad
affectionate
eyes
now
came
and
took
his
arm
before
looked
round
prince
andrew
frowned
again
expressing
his
annoyance
with
whoever
was
touching
his
arm
but
when
saw
pierre
beaming
face
gave
him
unexpectedly
kind
and
pleasant
smile

laughing
and
pressing
pierre

show
that
there
was
need
ask
the
question
wished

something
more
but
that
moment

between
the

lightly
holding
the
folds

and
the
smile
shone
still
more
radiantly
her
beautiful

pierre
gazed

rapturous
almost
frightened
eyes

although
prince
vasili
listened
reluctantly
and
not
very
politely
the
elderly
lady
even
betraying
some
impatience
she
gave
him
ingratiating
and
appealing
smile
and
took
his

quite
true

been
indebted

father
for

but
soon
the
prince
had
gone
her

resumed
its
former
cold
artificial
expression
she
returned

remains
the
throne
france
year
longer
the
vicomte
continued
with
the
air
man
who
matter
with
which
better
acquainted
than
anyone
else
does
not
listen
others
but
follows
the
current
his
own
thoughts
things
will
have
gone
too
far
intrigues
violence
exile
and
executions
french
society
mean
good
french
society
will
have
been
forever
destroyed
and
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
hands
pierre
wished
make
remark
for
the
conversation
interested
him
but
anna
pavlovna
who
had
him
under
observation
interrupted
the
emperor
alexander
said
she
with
the
melancholy
which
always
accompanied
any
reference
hers
the
imperial
family
has
declared
that
will
leave
the
french
people
themselves
choose
their
own
form
government
and
believe
that
once
free
from
the
usurper
the
whole
nation
will
certainly
throw
itself
into
the
arms
its
rightful
king
she
concluded
trying
amiable
the
royalist
emigrant
that
doubtful
said
prince
andrew
monsieur
vicomte
quite
rightly
supposes
that
matters
have
already
gone
too
far
think
will
difficult
return
the
old
regime
from
what
have
heard
said
pierre
blushing
and
breaking
into
the
conversation
almost
all
the
aristocracy
has
already
gone
over
bonaparte
side
the
buonapartists
who
say
that
replied
the
vicomte
without
looking
pierre
the
present
time
difficult
know
the
real
state
french
public
opinion
bonaparte
has
said
remarked
prince
andrew
with
sarcastic
smile
was
evident
that
did
not
like
the
vicomte
and
was
aiming
his
remarks
him
though
without
looking
him
showed
them
the
path
glory
but
they
did
not
follow
prince
andrew
continued
after
short
silence
again
quoting
napoleon
words
opened
antechambers
and
they
crowded
not
know
how
far
was
justified
saying
not
the
least
replied
the
vicomte
after
the
murder
the
duc
even
the
most
partial
ceased
regard
him
hero
some
people
went
turning
anna
pavlovna
ever
was
hero
after
the
murder
the
duc
there
was
one
martyr
more
heaven
and
one
hero
less
earth
before
anna
pavlovna
and
the
others
had
time
smile
their
appreciation
the
vicomte
epigram
pierre
again
broke
into
the
conversation
and
though
anna
pavlovna
felt
sure
would
say
something
inappropriate
she
was
unable
stop
him
the
execution
the
duc
enghien
declared
monsieur
pierre
was
political
necessity
and
seems
that
napoleon
showed
greatness
soul
not
fearing
take
himself
the
whole
responsibility
that
deed
dieu
mon
dieu
muttered
anna
pavlovna
terrified
whisper
what
monsieur
pierre
you
consider
that
assassination
shows
greatness
soul
said
the
little
princess
smiling
and
drawing
her
work
nearer
her
exclaimed
several
voices
capital
said
prince
hippolyte
english
and
began
slapping
his
knee
with
the
palm
his
hand
the
vicomte
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
pierre
looked
solemnly
his
audience
over
his
spectacles
and
continued
say
continued
desperately
because
the
bourbons
fled
from
the
revolution
leaving
the
people
anarchy
and
napoleon
alone
understood
the
revolution
and
quelled
and
for
the
general
good
could
not
stop
short
for
the
sake
one
man
life
won
you
come
over
the
other
table
suggested
anna
pavlovna
but
pierre
continued
his
speech
without
heeding
her
cried
becoming
more
and
more
eager
napoleon
great
because
rose
superior
the
revolution
suppressed
its
abuses
preserved
all
that
was
good
equality
citizenship
and
freedom
speech
and
the
press
and
only
for
that
reason
did
obtain
power
yes
having
obtained
power
without
availing
himself
commit
murder
had
restored
the
rightful
king
should
have
called
him
great
man
remarked
the
vicomte
could
not
that
the
people
only
gave
him
power
that
might
rid
them
the
bourbons
and
because
they
saw
that
was
great
man
the
revolution
was
grand
thing
continued
monsieur
pierre
betraying
this
desperate
and
provocative
proposition
his
extreme
youth
and
his
wish
express
all
that
was
his
mind
what
revolution
and
regicide
grand
thing
well
after
that
but
won
you
come
this
other
table
repeated
anna
pavlovna
rousseau
contrat
social
said
the
vicomte
with
tolerant
smile
not
speaking
regicide
speaking
about
ideas
yes
ideas
robbery
murder
and
regicide
again
interjected
ironical
voice
those
were
extremes
doubt
but
they
are
not
what
most
important
what
important
are
the
rights
man
emancipation
from
prejudices
and
equality
citizenship
and
all
these
ideas
napoleon
has
retained
full
force
liberty
and
equality
said
the
vicomte
contemptuously
last
deciding
seriously
prove
this
youth
how
foolish
his
words
were
high
sounding
words
which
have
long
been
discredited
who
does
not
love
liberty
and
equality
even
our
saviour
preached
liberty
and
equality
have
people
since
the
revolution
become
happier
the
contrary
wanted
liberty
but
buonaparte
has
destroyed
prince
andrew
kept
looking
with
amused
smile
from
pierre
the
vicomte
and
from
the
vicomte
their
hostess
the
first
moment
pierre
outburst
anna
pavlovna
despite
her
social
experience
was
horror
struck
but
when
she
saw
that
pierre
sacrilegious
words
had
not
exasperated
the
vicomte
and
had
convinced
herself
that
was
impossible
stop
him
she
rallied
her
forces
and
joined
the
vicomte
vigorous
attack
the
orator
but
dear
monsieur
pierre
said
she
how
you
explain
the
fact
great
man
executing
duc
even
ordinary
man
who
innocent
and
untried
should
like
said
the
vicomte
ask
how
monsieur
explains
the
brumaire
was
not
that
imposture
was
swindle
and
not
all
like
the
conduct
great
man
and
the
prisoners
killed
africa
that
was
horrible
said
the
little
princess
shrugging
her
shoulders
low
fellow
say
what
you
will
remarked
prince
hippolyte
pierre
not
knowing
whom
answer
looked
them
all
and
smiled
his
smile
was
unlike
the
half
smile
other
people
when
smiled
his
grave
even
rather
gloomy
look
was
instantaneously
replaced
another
childlike
kindly
even
rather
silly
look
which
seemed
ask
forgiveness
the
vicomte
who
was
meeting
him
for
the
first
time
saw
clearly
that
this
young
jacobin
was
not
terrible
his
words
suggested
all
were
silent
how
you
expect
him
answer
you
all
once
said
prince
andrew
besides
the
actions
statesman
one
has
distinguish
between
his
acts
private
person
general
and
emperor
seems
yes
yes
course
pierre
chimed
pleased
the
arrival
this
reinforcement
one
must
admit
continued
prince
andrew
that
napoleon
man
was
great
the
bridge
arcola
and
the
hospital
jaffa
where
gave
his
hand
the
plague
stricken
but
but
there
are
other
acts
which
difficult
justify
prince
andrew
who
had
evidently
wished
tone
down
the
awkwardness
pierre
remarks
rose
and
made
sign
his
wife
that
was
time
suddenly
prince
hippolyte
started
making
signs
everyone
attend
and
asking
them
all
seated
began
was
told
charming
moscow
story
today
and
must
treat
you
excuse
vicomte
must
tell
russian
the
point
will
lost
and
prince
hippolyte
began
tell
his
story
such
russian
frenchman
would
speak
after
spending
about
year
russia
everyone
waited
emphatically
and
eagerly
did
demand
their
attention
his
story
there
moscow
lady
une
dame
and
she
very
stingy
she
must
have
two
footmen
behind
her
carriage
and
very
big
ones
that
was
her
taste
and
she
had
lady
maid
also
big
she
said
here
prince
hippolyte
paused
evidently
collecting
his
ideas
with
difficulty
she
said
yes
she
said
girl
the
maid
put
livery
get
behind
the
carriage
and
come
with
while
make
some
calls
here
prince
hippolyte
spluttered
and
burst
out
laughing
long
before
his
audience
which
produced
effect
unfavorable
the
narrator
several
persons
among
them
the
elderly
lady
and
anna
pavlovna
did
however
smile
she
went
suddenly
there
was
great
wind
the
girl
lost
her
hat
and
her
long
hair
came
down
here
could
contain
himself
longer
and
went
between
gasps
laughter
and
the
whole
world
knew
and
the
anecdote
ended
though
was
unintelligible
why
had
told
why
had
told
russian
still
anna
pavlovna
and
the
others
appreciated
prince
hippolyte
social
tact
agreeably
ending
pierre
unpleasant
and
unamiable
outburst
after
the
anecdote
the
conversation
broke
into
insignificant
small
talk
about
the
last
and
next
balls
about
theatricals
and
who
would
meet
whom
and
when
and
where
chapter
having
thanked
anna
pavlovna
for
her
charming
soiree
the
guests
began
take
their
leave
pierre
was
ungainly
stout
about
the
average
height
broad
with
huge
red
hands
did
not
know
the
saying
how
enter
drawing
room
and
still
less
how
leave
one
that
how
say
something
particularly
agreeable
before
going
away
besides
this
was
absent
minded
when
rose
took
instead
his
own
the
general
three
cornered
hat
and
held
pulling
the
plume
till
the
general
asked
him
restore
all
his
absent
mindedness
and
inability
enter
room
and
converse
was
however
redeemed
his
kindly
simple
and
modest
expression
anna
pavlovna
turned
toward
him
and
with
christian
mildness
that
expressed
forgiveness
his
indiscretion
nodded
and
said
hope
see
you
again
but
also
hope
you
will
change
your
opinions
dear
monsieur
pierre
when
she
said
this
did
not
reply
and
only
bowed
but
again
everybody
saw
his
smile
which
said
nothing
unless
perhaps
opinions
are
opinions
but
you
see
what
capital
good
natured
fellow
and
everyone
including
anna
pavlovna
felt
this
prince
andrew
had
gone
out
into
the
hall
and
turning
his
shoulders
the
footman
who
was
helping
him
with
his
cloak
listened
indifferently
his
wife
chatter
with
prince
hippolyte
who
had
also
come
into
the
hall
prince
hippolyte
stood
close
the
pretty
pregnant
princess
and
stared
fixedly
her
through
his
eyeglass
annette
you
will
catch
cold
said
the
little
princess
taking
leave
anna
pavlovna
settled
she
added
low
voice
anna
pavlovna
had
already
managed
speak
lise
about
the
match
she
contemplated
between
anatole
and
the
little
princess
sister
law
rely
you
dear
said
anna
pavlovna
also
low
tone
write
her
and
let
know
how
her
father
looks
the
matter
revoir
and
she
left
the
hall
prince
hippolyte
approached
the
little
princess
and
bending
his
face
close
her
began
whisper
something
two
footmen
the
princess
and
his
own
stood
holding
shawl
and
cloak
waiting
for
the
conversation
finish
they
listened
the
french
sentences
which
them
were
meaningless
with
air
understanding
but
not
wishing
appear
the
princess
usual
spoke
smilingly
and
listened
with
laugh
very
glad
did
not
the
ambassador
said
prince
hippolyte
dull
has
been
delightful
evening
has
not
delightful
they
say
the
ball
will
very
good
replied
the
princess
drawing
her
downy
little
lip
all
the
pretty
women
society
will
there
not
all
for
you
will
not
there
not
all
said
prince
hippolyte
smiling
joyfully
and
snatching
the
shawl
from
the
footman
whom
even
pushed
aside
began
wrapping
round
the
princess
either
from
awkwardness
intentionally
one
could
have
said
which
after
the
shawl
had
been
adjusted
kept
his
arm
around
her
for
long
time
though
embracing
her
still
smiling
she
gracefully
moved
away
turning
and
glancing
her
husband
prince
andrew
eyes
were
closed
weary
and
sleepy
did
seem
are
you
ready
asked
his
wife
looking
past
her
prince
hippolyte
hurriedly
put
his
cloak
which
the
latest
fashion
reached
his
very
heels
and
stumbling
ran
out
into
the
porch
following
the
princess
whom
footman
was
helping
into
the
carriage
princesse
revoir
cried
stumbling
with
his
tongue
well
with
his
feet
the
princess
picking
her
dress
was
taking
her
seat
the
dark
carriage
her
husband
was
adjusting
his
saber
prince
hippolyte
under
pretense
helping
was
everyone
way
allow
sir
said
prince
andrew
russian
cold
disagreeable
tone
prince
hippolyte
who
was
blocking
his
path
expecting
you
pierre
said
the
same
voice
but
gently
and
affectionately
the
postilion
started
the
carriage
wheels
rattled
prince
hippolyte
laughed
spasmodically
stood
the
porch
waiting
for
the
vicomte
whom
had
promised
take
home
well
mon
cher
said
the
vicomte
having
seated
himself
beside
hippolyte
the
carriage
your
little
princess
very
nice
very
nice
indeed
quite
french
and
kissed
the
tips
his
fingers
hippolyte
burst
out
laughing
you
know
you
are
terrible
chap
for
all
your
innocent
airs
continued
the
vicomte
pity
the
poor
husband
that
little
officer
who
gives
himself
the
airs
monarch
hippolyte
spluttered
again
and
amid
his
laughter
said
and
you
were
saying
that
the
russian
ladies
are
not
equal
the
french
one
has
know
how
deal
with
them
pierre
reaching
the
house
first
went
into
prince
andrew
study
like
one
quite
home
and
from
habit
immediately
lay
down
the
sofa
took
from
the
shelf
the
first
book
that
came
his
hand
was
caesar
commentaries
and
resting
his
elbow
began
reading
the
middle
what

you
done
mlle

she
will
quite
ill

said
prince
andrew
entered
the
study
rubbing
his
small
white
hands
pierre
turned
his
whole
body
making
the
sofa
creak
lifted
his
eager
face
prince
andrew
smiled
and
waved
his
hand
that
abbe
very
interesting
but
does
not
see
the
thing
the
right
light
opinion
perpetual
peace
possible
but
not
know
how
express
not
balance
political
power
was
evident
that
prince
andrew
was
not
interested
such
abstract
conversation
one
can
everywhere
say
all
one
thinks
mon
cher
well
have
you
last
decided

asked
prince
andrew
after
momentary
silence
pierre
sat
the
sofa
with
his
legs
tucked
under
him
really
don
yet
know
don
like
either
the
one
the
other
but
you
must
decide
something
your
father
expects
pierre
the
age
ten
had
been
sent
abroad
with
abbe
tutor
and
had
remained
away
till
was
twenty
when
returned
moscow
his
father
dismissed
the
abbe
and
said
the

vasili
and

you
everything
pierre
had
already
been
choosing
career
for
three
months
and
had
not
decided
anything
was
about
this
choice
that
prince
andrew
was
speaking
pierre
rubbed
his
forehead
but
must
freemason
said
referring
the
abbe
whom
had
met
that
evening
that
all
nonsense
prince
andrew
again
interrupted
him
let
talk

you

understand
and
should
the
first
enter
the
army
but
help
england
and
austria
against
the
greatest
man
the
world
not
right
prince
andrew
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
pierre
childish
words
put
the
air
one
who
finds
impossible
reply
such
nonsense
but
would
fact
have
been
difficult
give
any
other
answer
than
the
one
prince
andrew
gave
this
naive
question
one
fought
except
his
own
conviction
there
would
wars
said
and
that
would
splendid
said
pierre
prince
andrew
smiled
ironically
very
likely
would
splendid
but
will
never
come
about
well
why
are
you
going
the
war
asked
pierre
what
for
don
know
must
besides
that
going
paused
going
because
the
life
leading
here
does
not
suit

replied
pierre
addressing
the
princess
with
none
the
embarrassment
commonly
shown
young

their
intercourse
with
young
women
the
princess
started
evidently
pierre

her
the

the

had
spoken
hippolyte
the
drawing
room
and
which
was
plainly
ill
suited
the
family
circle
which
pierre
was
almost
member
today
when
remembered
that
all
these
delightful
associations
must
broken
off
and
then
you
know
andre
she
looked
significantly
her
husband
afraid
afraid
she
whispered
and
shudder
ran
down
her
back
her
husband
looked
her
surprised
notice
that
someone
besides
pierre
and
himself
was
the
room
and
addressed
her
tone
frigid
politeness
what
you
are
afraid
lise
don
understand
said
there
what
egotists
men
all
are
all
all
egotists
just
for
whim
his
own
goodness
only
knows
why
leaves
and
locks
alone
the
country
with
father
and
sister
remember
said
prince
andrew
gently
alone
all
the
same
without
friends
and
expects
not
afraid
her
tone
was
now
querulous
and
her
lip
drawn
giving
her
not
joyful
but
animal
squirrel
like
expression
she
paused
she
felt
indecorous
speak
her
pregnancy
before
pierre
though
the
gist
the
matter
lay
that
still
can
understand
what
you
are
afraid
said
prince
andrew
slowly
not
taking
his
eyes
off
his
wife
the
princess
blushed
and
raised
her
arms
with
gesture
despair
andrew
must
say
you
have
changed
how
you
have
your
doctor
tells
you
bed
earlier
said
prince
andrew
you
had
better
the
princess
said
nothing
but
suddenly
her
short
downy
lip
quivered
prince
andrew
rose
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
about
the
room
pierre
looked
over
his
spectacles
with
naive
surprise
now
him
and
now
her
moved
about
rise
too
but
changed
his
mind
why
should
mind
monsieur
pierre
being
here
exclaimed
the
little
princess
suddenly
her
pretty
face
all
once
distorted
tearful
grimace
have
long
wanted
ask
you
andrew
why
you
have
changed
what
have
done
you
you
are
going
the
war
and
have
pity
for
why
lise
was
all
prince
andrew
said
but
that
one
word
expressed
entreaty
threat
and
above
all
conviction
that
she
would
herself
regret
her
words
but
she
went
hurriedly
you
treat
like
invalid
child
see
all
did
you
behave
like
that
six
months
ago
lise
beg
you
desist
said
prince
andrew
still
more
emphatically
pierre
who
had
been
growing
more
and
more
agitated
listened
all
this
rose
and
approached
the
princess
seemed
unable
bear
the
sight
tears
and
was
ready
cry
himself
calm

pleasure

the
evening

muttered
the
princess
without
restraining
her
angry
tears
lise
said
prince
andrew
dryly
raising
his
voice
the
pitch
which
indicates
that
patience
exhausted
suddenly
the
angry
squirrel
like
expression
the
princess
pretty
face
changed
into
winning
and
piteous
look
fear
her
beautiful
eyes
glanced
askance
her
husband
face
and
her
own
assumed
the
timid
deprecating
expression

when
rapidly
but
feebly
wags
its
drooping
tail
mon

she
muttered
and
lifting
her
dress
with
one
hand
she
went
her
husband
and
kissed
him
the
forehead
good
night
lise
said
rising
and
courteously
kissing
her

chapter

the
friends
were
silent
neither
cared

talking

continually
glanced
prince
andrew
prince
andrew
rubbed
his
forehead
with
his
small
hand
let
and
have
supper
said
with
sigh
going
the
door
they
entered
the
elegant
newly
decorated
and
luxurious
dining
room
everything
from
the
table
napkins
the
silver
china
and
glass
bore
that
imprint
newness
found
the
households
the
newly
married
halfway
through
supper
prince
andrew
leaned
his
elbows
the
table
and
with
look
nervous
agitation
such
pierre
had
never
before
seen
his
face
began
talk
one
who
has
long
had
something
his
mind
and
suddenly
determines
speak
out
never
never
marry
dear
fellow
that
advice
never
marry
till
you
can
say
yourself
that
you
have
done
all
you
are
capable
and
until
you
have
ceased
love
the
woman
your
choice
and
have
seen
her
plainly
she
else
you
will
make
cruel
and
irrevocable
mistake
marry
when
you
are
old
and
good
for
nothing
all
that
good
and
noble
you
will
lost
will
all
wasted
trifles
yes
yes
yes
don
look
with
such
surprise
you
marry
expecting
anything
from
yourself
the
future
you
will
feel
every
step
that
for
you
all
ended
all
closed
except
the
drawing
room
where
you
will
ranged
side
side
with
court
lackey
and
idiot
but
what
the
good
and
waved
his
arm
pierre
took
off
his
spectacles
which
made
his
face
seem
different
and
the
good
natured
expression
still
more
apparent
and
gazed
his
friend
amazement
wife
continued
prince
andrew
excellent
woman
one
those
rare
women
with
whom
man
honor
safe
but
god
what
would
not
give
now
unmarried
you
are
the
first
and
only
one
whom
mention
this
because
like
you
said
this
prince
andrew
was
less
than
ever
like
that
bolkonski
who
had
lolled
anna
pavlovna
easy
chairs
and
with
half
closed
eyes
had
uttered
french
phrases
between
his
teeth
every
muscle
his
thin
face
was
now
quivering
with
nervous
excitement
his
eyes
which
the
fire
life
had
seemed
extinguished
now
flashed
with
brilliant
light
was
evident
that
the
more
lifeless
seemed
ordinary
times
the
more
impassioned
became
these
moments
almost
morbid
irritation
you
don
understand
why
say
this
continued
but
the
whole
story
life
you
talk
bonaparte
and
his
career
said
though
pierre
had
not
mentioned
bonaparte
but
bonaparte
when
worked
went
step
step
toward
his
goal
was
free
had
nothing
but
his
aim
consider
and
reached
but
tie
yourself
with
woman
and
like
chained
convict
you
lose
all
freedom
and
all
you
have
hope
and
strength
merely
weighs
you
down
and
torments
you
with
regret
drawing
rooms
gossip
balls
vanity
and
triviality
these
are
the
enchanted
circle
cannot
escape
from
now
going
the
war
the
greatest
war
there
ever
was
and
know
nothing
and
fit
for
nothing
very
amiable
and
have
caustic
wit
continued
prince
andrew
and
anna
pavlovna
they
listen
and
that
stupid
set
without
whom
wife
cannot
exist
and
those
women
you
only
knew
what
those
society
women
are
and
women
general
father
right
selfish
vain
stupid
trivial
everything
that
what
women
are
when
you
see
them
their
true
colors
when
you
meet
them
society
seems
there
were
something
them
but
there
nothing
nothing
nothing
don
marry
dear
fellow
don
marry
concluded
prince
andrew
seems
funny
said
pierre
that
you
you
should
consider
yourself
incapable
and
your
life
spoiled
life
you
have
everything
before
you
everything
and
you
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
his
tone
showed
how
highly
thought
his
friend
and
how
much
expected
him
the
future
how
can
talk
like
that
thought
pierre
considered
his
friend
model
perfection
because
prince
andrew
possessed
the
highest
degree
just
the
very
qualities
pierre
lacked
and
which
might
best
described
strength
will
pierre
was
always
astonished
prince
andrew
calm
manner
treating
everybody
his
extraordinary
memory
his
extensive
reading
had
read
everything
knew
everything
and
had
opinion
about
everything
but
above
all
his
capacity
for
work
and
study
and
pierre
was
often
struck
andrew
lack
capacity
for
philosophical
meditation
which
himself
was
particularly
addicted
regarded
even
this
not
defect
but
sign
strength
even
the
best
most
friendly
and
simplest
relations
life
praise
and
commendation
are
essential
just
grease
necessary
wheels
that
they
may
run
smoothly
part
played
out
said
prince
andrew
what
the
use
talking
about
let
talk
about
you
added
after
silence
smiling
his
reassuring
thoughts
that
smile
was
immediately
reflected
pierre
face
but
what
there
say
about
said
pierre
his
face
relaxing
into
careless
merry
smile
what
illegitimate
son
suddenly
blushed
crimson
and
was
plain
that
had
made
great
effort
say
this
without
name
and
without
means
and
really
but
did
not
say
what
really
was
for
the
present
free
and
all
right
only
haven
the
least
idea
what
wanted
consult
you
seriously
prince
andrew
looked
kindly
him
yet
his
glance
friendly
and
affectionate
was
expressed
sense
his
own
superiority
fond
you
especially
you
are
the
one
live
man
among
our
whole
set
yes
you
all
right
choose
what
you
will
all
the
same
you
all
right
anywhere
but
look
here
give
visiting
those
kuragins
and
leading
that
sort
life
suits
you
badly
all
this
debauchery
dissipation
and
the
rest
what
would
you
have
dear
fellow
answered
pierre
shrugging
his
shoulders
women
dear
fellow
women
don
understand
replied
prince
andrew
women
who
are
comme
faut
that
different
matter
but
the
kuragins
set
women
women
and
wine
don
understand
pierre
was
staying
prince
vasili
kuragin
and
sharing
the
dissipated
life
his
son
anatole
the
son
whom
they
were
planning
reform
marrying
him
prince
andrew
sister
you
know
said
pierre
suddenly
struck
happy
thought
seriously
have
long
been
thinking
leading
such
life
can
decide
think
properly
about
anything
one
head
aches
and
one
spends
all
one
money
asked
for
tonight
but
won
you
give
your
word
honor
not
honor
chapter
was
past
one
clock
when
pierre
left
his
friend
was
cloudless
northern
summer
night
pierre
took
open
cab
intending
drive
straight
home
but
the
nearer
drew
the
house
the
more
felt
the
impossibility
going
sleep
such
night
was
light
enough
see
long
way
the
deserted
street
and
seemed
more
like
morning
evening
than
night
the
way
pierre
remembered
that
anatole
kuragin
was
expecting
the
usual
set
for
cards
that
evening
after
which
there
was
generally
drinking
bout
finishing
with
visits
kind
pierre
was
very
fond
should
like
kuragin
thought
but
immediately
recalled
his
promise
prince
andrew
not
there
then
happens
people
weak
character
desired
passionately
once
more
enjoy
that
dissipation
was
accustomed
that
decided
the
thought
immediately
occurred
him
that
his
promise
prince
andrew
was
account
because
before
gave
had
already
promised
prince
anatole
come
his
gathering
besides
thought
all
such
words
honor
are
conventional
things
with
definite
meaning
especially
one
considers
that
tomorrow
one
may
dead
something
extraordinary
may
happen
one
that
honor
and
dishonor
will
all
the
same
pierre
often
indulged
reflections
this
sort
nullifying
all
his
decisions
and
intentions
went
kuragin
reaching
the
large
house
near
the
horse
guards
barracks
which
anatole
lived

entered
the
lighted

ascended
the

off

listening

his

was
clearly
seen
the
lines
that
mouth
were
remarkably
finely
curved
the
middle
the
upper
lip
formed
sharp
wedge
and
closed
firmly
the
firm
lower
one
and
something
like
two
distinct
smiles
played
continually
round
the
two
corners
the
mouth
this
together
with
the
resolute
insolent
intelligence
his
eyes
produced
effect
which
made
impossible
not
notice
his

dolokhov
was
man
small
means
and
connections
yet
though
anatole
spent
tens
thousands
rubles
dolokhov
lived
with
him
and
had
placed
himself
such
footing
that
all
who
knew

including
anatole
himself
respected
him
more
than
they
did

dolokhov

her
eyes
under
their

long
lashes
watched
her
cousin
who
was
going
join
the
army
with
such
passionate
girlish
adoration
that
her
smile
could
not
for
single
instant
impose
upon
anyone
and
was
clear
that
the
kitten
had
settled
down
only
spring
with
more
energy
and
again
play
with
her
cousin

engaged
the
smiling

confidential
conversation
without
all
noticing
that
his
involuntary
smile
had
stabbed
the
heart
sonya

blushed
and
smiled
unnaturally

got
and
left

for
the

the

when
the
brightness

young
people
had
brought
into

vanished
and
answering
question
one
had
put
but
which
was
always
her
mind
and
how
much
suffering
how
much
anxiety
one
has
had
through
that

now
and
yet
really
the
anxiety
greater

the
countess

shall
always
daughters

and
that
nicholas
with

all
the

never
like
those
petersburg
young
men
yes

are
splendid
splendid

chimed
the
count
who
always
solved
questions
that
seemed
him
perplexing
deciding
that
everything
was
splendid
just
fancy

why

thirteen
and
she
love
with
boris
already
just
fancy
said
the
countess
with
gentle
smile
looking
boris
and
went
evidently
concerned
with
thought
that
always
occupied
her
now
you
see
were
severe
with
her
and
forbid
goodness
knows
what
they
might
the
sly
she
meant
that
they
would
kissing
but
know
every
word
she
utters
she
will
come
running
her
own
accord
the
evening
and
tell
everything
perhaps
spoil
her
but
really
that
seems
the
best
plan
with
her
elder
sister
was
stricter
yes
was
brought
quite
differently
remarked
the
handsome
elder
daughter
countess
vera
with
smile
but
the
smile
did
not
enhance
vera
beauty
smiles
generally
the
contrary
gave
her
unnatural
and
therefore
unpleasant
expression
vera
was
good
looking
not
all
stupid
quick
learning
was
well
brought
and
had
pleasant
voice
what
she
said
was
true
and
appropriate
yet
strange
say
everyone
the
visitors
and
countess
alike
turned
look
her
wondering
why
she
had
said
and
they
all
felt
awkward
people
are
always
too
clever
with
their
eldest
children
and
try
make
something
exceptional
them
said
the
visitor
what
the
good
denying
dear
our
dear
countess
was
too
clever
with
vera
said
the
count
well
what
that
she
turned
out
splendidly
all
the
same
added
winking
vera
the
guests
got
and
took
their
leave
promising
return
dinner
what
manners
thought
they
would
never
said
the
countess
when
she
had
seen
her
guests
out
chapter
xiii
when
natasha
ran
out
the
drawing
room
she
only
went
far
the
conservatory
there
she
paused
and
stood
listening
the
conversation
the
drawing
room
waiting
for
boris
come
out
she
was
already
growing
impatient
and
stamped
her
foot
ready
cry
his
not
coming
once
when
she
heard
the
young
man
discreet
steps
approaching
neither
quickly
nor
slowly
this
natasha
dashed
swiftly
among
the
flower
tubs
and
hid
there
boris
paused
the
middle
the
room
looked
round
brushed
little
dust
from
the
sleeve
his
uniform
and
going
mirror
examined
his
handsome
face
natasha
very
still
peered
out
from
her
ambush
waiting
see
what
would
stood
little
while
before
the
glass
smiled
and
walked
toward
the
other
door
natasha
was
about
call
him
but
changed
her
mind
let
him
look
for
thought
she
hardly
had
boris
gone
than
sonya
flushed
tears
and
muttering
angrily
came
the
other
door
natasha
checked
her
first
impulse
run
out
her
and
remained
her
hiding
place
watching
under
invisible
cap
see
what
went
the
world
she
was
experiencing
new
and
peculiar
pleasure
sonya
muttering
herself
kept
looking
round
toward
the
drawing
room
door
opened
and
nicholas
came
sonya
what
the
matter
with
you
how
can
you
said
running
her
nothing
nothing
leave
alone
sobbed
sonya
know
what
well

much
the
better
and
you
can
back
her
onya
look
here
how
can
you
torture

yourself
like
that
for
mere
fancy
said
nicholas
taking
her
hand
sonya
did
not
pull
away
and
left
off
crying
natasha
not
stirring
and
scarcely
breathing
watched
from
her
ambush
with
sparkling
eyes
what
will
happen
now
thought
she
sonya
what
anyone
the
world
you
alone
are
everything
said
nicholas
and
will
prove
you
don
like
you
talk
like
that
well
then
won
only
forgive
sonya
drew
her
him
and
kissed
her
how
nice
thought
natasha
and
when
sonya
and
nicholas
had
gone
out
the
conservatory
she
followed
and
called
boris
her
boris
come
here
said
she
with
sly
and
significant
look
have
something
tell
you
here
here
and
she
led
him
into
the
conservatory
the
place
among
the
tubs
where
she
had
been
hiding
boris
followed
her
smiling
what
the
something
asked
she
grew
confused
glanced
round
and
seeing
the
doll
she
had
thrown
down
one
the
tubs
picked
kiss
the
doll
said
she
boris
looked
attentively
and
kindly
her
eager
face
but
did
not
reply
don
you
want
well
then
come
here
said
she
and
went
further
among
the
plants
and
threw
down
the
doll
closer
closer
she
whispered
she
caught
the
young
officer
his
cuffs
and
look
solemnity
and
fear
appeared
her
flushed
face
and
would
you
like
kiss
she
whispered
almost
inaudibly
glancing
him
from
under
her
brows
smiling
and
almost
crying
from
excitement
boris
blushed
how
funny
you
are
said
bending
down
her
and
blushing
still
more
but
waited
and
did
nothing
suddenly
she
jumped
onto
tub
higher
than
embraced
him
that
both
her
slender
bare
arms
clasped
him
above
his
neck
and
tossing
back
her
hair
kissed
him
full
the
lips
then
she
slipped
down
among
the
flowerpots
the
other
side
the
tubs
and
stood
hanging
her
head
natasha
said
you
know
that
love
you
but
you
are
love
with
natasha
broke
yes
but
please
don
let

natasha
considered
thirteen

she
counted
her
slender
little
fingers
all
right
then
settled
smile
joy
and
satisfaction
lit
her
eager
face
settled
replied
boris
forever
said
the
little
girl
till
death
itself
she
took
his
arm
and
with
happy
face
went
with
him
into
the
adjoining
sitting
room
chapter
xiv
after
receiving
her
visitors
the
countess
was
tired
that
she
gave
orders
admit
more
but
the
porter
was
told
sure
invite
dinner
all
who
came
congratulate
the
countess
wished
have
tête
tête
talk
with
the
friend
her
childhood
princess
anna
mikhaylovna
whom
she
had
not
seen
properly
since
she
returned
from
petersburg
anna
mikhaylovna
with
her
tear
worn
but
pleasant
face
drew
her
chair
nearer
that
the
countess
with
you
will
quite
frank
said
anna
mikhaylovna
there
are
not
many
left
old
friends
that
why
value
your
friendship
anna
mikhaylovna
looked
vera
and
paused
the
countess
pressed
her
friend
hand
vera
she
said
her
eldest
daughter
who
was
evidently
not
favorite
how
you
have
little
tact
don
you
see
you
are
not
wanted
here
the
other
girls
the
handsome
vera
smiled
contemptuously
but
did
not
seem
all
hurt
you
had
told
sooner
mamma
would
have
gone
she
replied
she
rose
her
own
room
but
she
passed
the
sitting
room
she
noticed
two
couples
sitting
one
pair
each
window
she
stopped
and
smiled
scornfully
sonya
was
sitting
close
nicholas
who
was
copying
out
some
verses
for
her
the
first
had
ever
written
boris
and
natasha
were
the
other
window
and
ceased
talking
when
vera
entered
sonya
and
natasha
looked
vera
with
guilty
happy
faces
was
pleasant
and
touching
see
these
little
girls
love
but
apparently
the
sight
them
roused
pleasant
feeling
vera
how
often
have
asked
you
not
take
things
she
said
you
have
room
your
own
and
she
took
the
inkstand
from
nicholas
minute
minute
said
dipping
his
pen
you
always
manage
things
the
wrong
time
continued
vera
you
came
rushing
into
the
drawing
room
that
everyone
felt
ashamed
you
though
what
she
said
was
quite
just
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
one
replied
and
the
four
simply
looked
one
another
she
lingered
the
room
with
the
inkstand
her
hand
and
your
age
what
secrets
can
there
between
natasha
and
boris
between
you
two
all
nonsense
now
vera
what
does
matter
you
said
natasha
defense
speaking
very
gently
she
seemed
that
day
more
than
ever
kind
and
affectionate
everyone
very
silly
said
vera
ashamed
you
secrets
indeed
all
have
secrets
their
own
answered
natasha
getting
warmer

remarked
boris

complain
don
boris

such
diplomat
that
really
tiresome
said
natasha
mortified
voice
that
trembled
slightly
she
used
the
word
diplomat
which
was
just
then
much
vogue
among
the
children
the
special
sense
they
attached
why
does
she
bother
and
she
added
turning
vera
you
never
understand
because
you
never
loved
anyone
you
have
heart
you
are
madame
genlis
and
nothing

arranged

and

calmer
the
drawing

deserved
this
censure
but
asked
him
not
too
hard
the
poor
old
man
what
the
doctors
say
asked
the
princess
after
pause
her
worn
face
again
expressing
deep
sorrow

replied
the

and

added

tying

now
been
for
some
days
moscow
and
was
staying

his

house
though
expected
that
the

would
already
known

and
that
the
ladies
about
his
father
who
were
never
favorably
disposed
toward

would
have

against

the
eldest
princess
paused
her
reading
and
silently
stared
him
with
frightened
eyes
the
second
assumed
precisely
the

expression
while
the
youngest
the
one
with
the
mole
who
was

and

bent
over

evoked
the

foresaw

drew
her

down
through

and
scarcely
able

from
laughing
stooped
trying

out
the

how
you

said
pierre
you
don

recognize
you
only
too
well
too
well
how
the

asked
pierre
awkwardly
usual
but
unabashed
the
count
suffering
physically
and
mentally
and
apparently
you
have
done
your
best
increase
his
mental
sufferings
can
see
the

again
asked

added
giving

that
they
were
busy
and
busy
making

while
evidently
pierre
was
only
busy
causing
him
annoyance
olga
went
out
pierre
stood
looking
the

then
bowed
and
said
then
will

you
will
let

and
left

for

and
said
him
dear

you

here
you
did
petersburg
you
will
end
very
badly
that
all
have
say
you
the
count
very
very
ill
and
you
must
not
see
him
all
since
then
pierre
had
not
been
disturbed
and
had
spent
the
whole
time
his
rooms
upstairs
when
boris
appeared
his
door
pierre
was
pacing
and
down
his
room
stopping
occasionally
corner
make
menacing
gestures
the
wall
running
sword
through
invisible
foe
and
glaring
savagely
over
his
spectacles
and
then
again
resuming
his
walk
muttering
indistinct
words
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
gesticulating
england
done
for
said
scowling
and
pointing
his
finger
someone
unseen
pitt
traitor
the
nation
and
the
rights
man
sentenced
but
before
pierre
who
that
moment
imagined
himself
napoleon
person
and
have
just
effected
the
dangerous
crossing
the
straits
dover
and
captured
london
could
pronounce
pitt
sentence
saw
well
built
and
handsome
young
officer
entering
his
room
pierre
paused
had
left
moscow
when
boris
was
boy
fourteen
and
had
quite
forgotten
him
but
his
usual
impulsive
and
hearty
way
took
boris
the
hand
with
friendly
smile
you
remember
asked
boris
quietly
with
pleasant
smile
have
come
with
mother
see
the
count
but
seems
not
well
yes
seems
ill
people
are
always
disturbing
him
answered
pierre
trying
remember
who
this
young
man
was
boris
felt
that
pierre
did
not
recognize
him
but
did
not
consider
necessary
introduce
himself
and
without
experiencing
the
least
embarrassment
looked
pierre
straight
the
face
count
rostov
asks
you
come
dinner
today
said
after
considerable
pause
which
made
pierre
feel
uncomfortable
count
rostov
exclaimed
pierre
joyfully
then
you
are
his
son
ilya
only
fancy
didn
know
you
first
you
remember
how
went
the
sparrow
hills
with
madame
jacquot
such
age
you
are
mistaken
said
boris
deliberately
with
bold
and
slightly
sarcastic
smile
boris
son
princess
anna
mikhaylovna
drubetskaya
rostov
the
father
ilya
and
his
son
nicholas
never
knew
any
madame
jacquot
pierre
shook
his
head
and
arms
attacked
mosquitoes
bees
dear
what
thinking
about
mixed
everything
one
has
many
relatives
moscow
you
are
boris
course
well
now
know
where
are
and
what
you
think
the
boulogne
expedition
the
english
will
come
off
badly
you
know
napoleon
gets
across
the
channel
think
the
expedition
quite
feasible
only
villeneuve
doesn
make
mess
things
boris
knew
nothing
about
the
boulogne
expedition
did
not
read
the
papers
and
was
the
first
time
had
heard
villeneuve
name
here
moscow
are
more
occupied
with
dinner
parties
and
scandal
than
with
politics
said
his
quiet
ironical
tone
know
nothing
about
and
have
not
thought
about
moscow
chiefly
busy
with
gossip
continued
just
now
they
are
talking
about
you
and
your
father
pierre
smiled
his
good
natured
way
afraid
for
his
companion
sake
that
the
latter
might
say
something
would
afterwards
regret
but
boris
spoke
distinctly
clearly
and
dryly
looking
straight
into
pierre
eyes
moscow
has
nothing
else
but
gossip
boris
went
everybody
wondering
whom
the
count
will
leave
his
fortune
though
may
perhaps
outlive
all
sincerely
hope
will
yes
all
very
horrid
interrupted
pierre
very
horrid
pierre
was
still
afraid
that
this
officer
might
inadvertently
say
something
disconcerting
himself
and
must
seem
you
said
boris
flushing
slightly
but
not
changing
his
tone
attitude
must
seem
you
that
everyone
trying
get
something
out
the
rich
man
does
thought
pierre
but
just
wish
say
avoid
misunderstandings
that
you
are
quite
mistaken
you
reckon
mother
among
such
people
are
very
poor
but
for
own
part
any
rate
for
the
very
reason
that
your
father
rich
don
regard
myself
relation
his
and
neither
nor
mother
would
ever
ask
take
anything
from
him
for
long
time
pierre
could
not
understand
but
when
did
jumped
from
the
sofa
seized
boris
under
the
elbow
his
quick
clumsy
way
and
blushing
far
more
than
boris
began
speak
with
feeling
mingled
shame
and
vexation
well
this
strange
you
suppose
who
could
think
know
very
well
but
boris
again
interrupted
him
glad
have
spoken
out
fully
perhaps
you
did
not
like
you
must
excuse
said
putting
pierre
ease
instead
being
put
ease
him
but
hope
have
not
offended
you
always
make
rule
speak
out
well
what
answer
take
will
you
come
dinner
the
rostovs
and
boris
having
apparently
relieved
himself
onerous
duty
and
extricated
himself
from
awkward
situation
and
placed
another
became
quite
pleasant
again
but
say
said
pierre
calming
down
you
are
wonderful
fellow
what
you
have
just
said
good
very
good
course
you
don
know
have
not
met
for
such
long
time
not
since
were
children
you
might
think
that
understand
quite
understand
could
not
have
done
myself
should
not
have
had
the
courage
but
splendid
very
glad
have
made
your
acquaintance
queer
added
after
pause
that
you
should
have
suspected
began
laugh
well
what
hope
get
better
acquainted
and
pressed
boris
hand
you
know
have
not
once
been
see
the
count
has
not
sent
for
sorry
for
him
man
but
what
can
one
and
you
think
napoleon
will
manage
get
army
across
asked
boris
with
smile
pierre
saw
that
boris
wished
change
the
subject
and
being
the
same
mind
began
explaining
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
the
boulogne
expedition
footman
came
summon
boris
the
princess
was
going
pierre
order
make
boris
better
acquaintance
promised
come
dinner
and
warmly
pressing
his
hand
looked
affectionately
over
his
spectacles
into
boris
eyes
after
had
gone
pierre
continued
pacing
and
down
the
room
for
long
time
longer

bending

and
then
the

with
evident
pleasure
and
listened

having
stuck

far
into

was
inhaling
the
smoke
spasmodically
and
screwing
his

this
was
old
bachelor
shinshin
cousin
the

with
sharp
tongue

said

condescending

with

gently
inhaled
the

especially
when
succeeded

said
shinshin
laughing
ironically
and
mixing
the
most
ordinary

with
the
choicest
french

which
was

peter

show
that
the

the
advantages
are
far
less
than
the

just
consider
own
position
now
peter
nikolaevich
berg
always
spoke
quietly
politely
and
with
great
precision
his
conversation
always
related
entirely
himself
would
remain
calm
and
silent
when
the
talk
related
any
topic
that
had
direct
bearing
himself
could
remain
silent
for
hours
without
being
all
put
out
countenance
himself
making
others
uncomfortable
but
soon
the
conversation
concerned
himself
would
begin
talk
circumstantially
and
with
evident
satisfaction
consider
position
peter
nikolaevich
were
the
cavalry
should
get
not
more
than
two
hundred
rubles
every
four
months
even
with
the
rank

looking
shinshin

the

with

were
obvious
him
that
his

always
the
chief
desire

shinshin
moving
his

side
his
mouth
and
winking
the
count
that
squares
matters
the
count
burst
out
laughing
the
other

seeing
that
shinshin
was
talking
came
listen
berg
oblivious
irony
indifference
continued
explain
how
exchanging
into
the
guards
had
already
gained
step
his
old
comrades
the
cadet
corps
how
wartime
the
company
commander
might
get
killed
and
senior
the
company
might
easily
succeed
the
post
how
popular
was
with
everyone
the
regiment
and
how
satisfied
his
father
was
with
him
berg
evidently
enjoyed
narrating
all
this
and
did
not
seem
suspect
that
others
too
might
have
their
own
interests
but
all
said
was
prettily
sedate
and
the
naivete
his
youthful
egotism
was
obvious
that
disarmed
his
hearers
well

mouth
drooped
sonya
what

the
matter
and
natasha
large
mouth
widened
making
her
look
quite
ugly
and
she
began
wail
like

without
knowing
why
except
that
sonya

crying
sonya
tried

satisfaction
being
able
clearly

and
state
the

meanwhile
prince
vasili
had
opened
the
door
into
the
princess
room
this
room
was
almost
dark
only
two
tiny
lamps
were
burning
before
the
icons
and
there
was
pleasant
scent
flowers
and
burnt
pastilles
the

was
crowded
with
small
pieces
furniture

and
little
tables

was
just
visible
behind

began
bark

she
rose
and
smoothed
her
hair
which
was
usual
extremely
smooth
that
seemed
made
one
piece
with
her

and
covered
with
varnish
has

she
asked
terrified

the

seating
himself
wearily
the
chair

had
just
vacated

catherine
thought
perhaps

she
said
with
her
unchanging
stonily
severe
expression
and
sitting
down
opposite
the
prince
she
prepared
listen
wished
get
nap
mon
cousin
but
can
well
dear
said
prince
vasili
taking
her
hand
and
bending
downwards
was
his
habit
was
plain
that
this
well
referred
much
that
they
both
understood
without
naming
the
princess
who
had
straight
rigid
body
abnormally
long
for
her
legs
looked
directly
prince
vasili
with
sign
emotion
her
prominent
gray
eyes
then
she
shook
her
head
and
glanced
the
icons
with
sigh
this
might
have
been
taken
expression
sorrow
and
devotion
weariness
and
hope
resting
before
long
prince
vasili
understood

and
said
you

easier
for
worn
out
post
horse
but
still
must
have
talk
with
you
catiche
very
serious
talk
prince
vasili
said
more
and
his
cheeks
began
twitch
nervously
now
one
side
now
the
other
giving
his
face
unpleasant
expression
which
was
never
seen
drawing
room
his
eyes
too
seemed
strange
one
moment
they
looked
impudently
sly
and
the
next
glanced
round
alarm
the
princess
holding
her
little
dog
her
lap
with
her
thin
bony
hands
looked
attentively
into
prince
vasili
eyes
evidently
resolved
not
the
first
break
silence
she
had
wait
till
morning
well
you
see
dear
princess
and
cousin
catherine
semenovna
continued
prince
vasili
returning
his
theme
apparently
not
without
inner
struggle
such
moment
this
one
must
think
everything
one
must
think
the
future
all
you
love
you
all
like
children
own
you
know
the
princess
continued
look
him
without
moving
and
with
the
same
dull
expression
and
then
course
family
has
also
considered
prince
vasili
went
testily
pushing
away
little
table
without
looking
her
you
know
catiche
that
you
three
sisters
mamontov
and
wife
are
the
count
only
direct
heirs
know
know
how
hard
for
you
talk
think
such
matters
easier
for
but
dear
getting
for
sixty
and
must
prepared
for
anything
you
know
have
sent
for
pierre
the
count
pointing
his
portrait
definitely
demanded
that
should
called
prince
vasili
looked
questioningly
the
princess
but
could
not
make
out
whether
she
was
considering
what
had
just
said
whether
she
was
simply
looking
him
there
one
thing
constantly
pray
god
grant
mon
cousin
she
replied
and
that
would
merciful
him
and
would
allow
his
noble
soul
peacefully
leave
this
yes
yes
course
interrupted
prince
vasili
impatiently
rubbing
his
bald
head
and
angrily
pulling
back
toward
him
the
little
table
that
had
pushed
away
but
short
the
fact
you
know
yourself
that
last
winter
the
count
made
will
which
left
all
his
property
not
his
direct
heirs
but
pierre
has
made
wills
enough
quietly
remarked
the
princess
but
cannot
leave
the
estate
pierre
pierre
illegitimate
but
dear
said
prince
vasili
suddenly
clutching
the
little
table
and
becoming
more
animated
and
talking
more
rapidly
what
letter
has
been
written
the
emperor
which
the
count
asks
for
pierre
legitimation
you
understand
that
consideration
the
count
services
his
request
would
granted
the
princess
smiled
people
who
think
they
know
more
about
the
subject
under
discussion
than
those
they
are
talking
with
can
tell
you
more
continued
prince
vasili
seizing
her
hand
that
letter
was
written
though
was
not
sent
and
the
emperor
knew
the
only
question
has
been
destroyed
not
not
then
soon
all
over
and
prince
vasili
sighed
intimate
what
meant
the
words
all
over
and
the
count
papers
are
opened
the
will
and
letter
will
delivered
the
emperor
and
the
petition
will
certainly
granted
pierre
will
get
everything
the
legitimate
son
and
our
share
asked
the
princess
smiling
ironically
anything
might
happen
only
not
that
but
poor
catiche
clear
daylight
will
then
the
legal
heir
everything
and
you
won
get
anything
you
must
know
dear
whether
the
will
and
letter
were
written
and
whether
they
have
been
destroyed
not
and
they
have
somehow
been
overlooked
you
ought
know
where
they
are
and
must
find
them
because
what
next
the
princess
interrupted
smiling
sardonically
and
not
changing
the
expression
her
eyes
woman
and
you
think
are
all
stupid
but
know
this
illegitimate
son
cannot
inherit
batard
she
added
supposing
that
this
translation
the
word
would
effectively
prove
prince
vasili
the
invalidity
his
contention
bastard
well
really
catiche
can
you
understand
you
are
intelligent
how
you
don
see
that
the
count
has
written
letter
the
emperor
begging
him
recognize
pierre
legitimate
follows
that
pierre
will
not
pierre
but
will
become
count
bezukhov
and
will
then
inherit
everything
under
the
will
and
the
will
and
letter
are
not
destroyed
then
you
will
have
nothing
but
the
consolation
having
been
dutiful
tout
qui
ensuit
that
certain
and
all
that
follows
therefrom
know
the
will
was
made
but
also
know
that
invalid
and
you
mon
cousin
seem
consider
perfect
fool
said
the
princess
with
the
expression
women
assume
when
they
suppose
they
are
saying
something
witty
and
stinging
dear
princess
catherine
semenovna
began
prince
vasili
impatiently
came
here
not
wrangle
with
you
but
talk
about
your
interests
with
kinswoman
good
kind
true
relation
and
tell
you
for
the
tenth
time
that

the
count
papers

expert
have
just
been

dmitri
onufrich
the
family
solicitor
and
says
the
same
this
sudden
change
evidently
took
place
the
princess
ideas
her
thin
lips
grew
white
though
her
eyes
did
not
change
and
her
voice
when
she
began
speak
passed
through
such
transitions
she
herself
evidently
did
not
expect
that
would
fine
thing
said
she
never
wanted
anything
and
don
now
she
pushed
the
little
dog
off
her
lap
and
smoothed
her
dress
and
this
gratitude
this
recognition
for
those
who
have
sacrificed
everything
for
his
sake
she
cried
splendid
fine

prince
vasili

the
princess
did
not
listen
him

long
ago

that

expect
nothing
but
meanness
deceit
envy

blackest
ingratitude

her
fast
though

she
wheedled
herself
here
and
told
the
count
such
vile
disgraceful
things
about
especially
about
sophie

repeat
them
that
made
the
count
quite
ill
and
would
not

infamous

vile
woman
almost
shrieked
the
princess
now
quite
changed
and
what

worming
herself
here
for
but
will
give
her
piece

the
time

chapter
xxii
while
these
conversations
were
going
the
reception
room
and
the
princess
room
carriage
containing
pierre
who
had
been
sent
for
and
anna
mikhaylovna
who
found
necessary
accompany
him
was
driving
into
the
court
count
bezukhov
house
the
wheels
rolled
softly
over
the
straw
beneath
the
windows
anna
mikhaylovna
having
turned
with
words
comfort
her
companion
realized
that
was
asleep
his
corner
and
woke
him
rousing
himself
pierre
followed
anna
mikhaylovna
out
the
carriage
and
only
then
began
think
the
interview
with
his
dying
father
which
awaited
him
noticed
that
they
had
not
come
the
front
entrance
but
the
back
door
while
was
getting
down
from
the
carriage
steps
two
men
who
looked
like
tradespeople
ran
hurriedly
from
the
entrance
and
hid
the
shadow
the
wall
pausing
for
moment
pierre
noticed
several
other
men
the
same
kind
hiding
the
shadow
the
house
both
sides
but
neither
anna
mikhaylovna
nor
the
footman
nor
the
coachman
who
could
not
help
seeing
these
people
took
any
notice
them
seems
all
right
pierre
concluded
and
followed
anna
mikhaylovna
she
hurriedly
ascended
the
narrow
dimly
lit
stone
staircase
calling
pierre
who
was
lagging
behind
follow
though
did
not
see
why
was
necessary
for
him
the
count
all
still
less
why
had
the
back
stairs
yet
judging
anna
mikhaylovna
air
assurance
and
haste
pierre
concluded
that
was
all
absolutely
necessary
halfway
the
stairs
they
were
almost
knocked
over
some
men
who
carrying
pails
came
running
downstairs
their
boots
clattering
these
men
pressed
close
the
wall
let
pierre
and
anna
mikhaylovna
pass
and
did
not
evince
the
least
surprise
seeing
them
there
this
the
way
the
princesses
apartments
asked
anna
mikhaylovna
one
them
yes
replied
footman
bold
loud
voice
anything
were
now
permissible
the
door
the
left
perhaps
the
count
did
not
ask
for
said
pierre
when
reached
the
landing
better
own
room
anna
mikhaylovna
paused
and
waited
for
him
come
friend
she
said
touching
his
arm
she
had
done
her
son
when
speaking
him
that
afternoon
believe
suffer
less
than
you
but
man
but
really
hadn
better
away
asked
looking
kindly
her
over
his
spectacles
dear
friend
forget
the
wrongs
that
may
have
been
done
you
think
that
your
father
perhaps
the
agony
death
she
sighed
have
loved
you
like
son
from
the
first
trust
yourself
pierre
shall
not
forget
your
interests
pierre
did
not
understand
word
but
the
conviction
that
all
this
had
grew
stronger
and
meekly
followed
anna
mikhaylovna
who
was
already
opening
door
this
door
led
into
back
anteroom
old
man
servant
the
princesses
sat
corner
knitting
stocking
pierre
had
never
been
this
part
the
house
and
did
not
even
know
the
existence
these
rooms
anna
mikhaylovna
addressing
maid
who
was
hurrying
past
with
decanter
tray
dear
and
sweet
asked
about
the

health
and
then
led
pierre
along
stone
passage
the
first
door
the
left
led
into
the
princesses
apartments
the
maid
with
the
decanter
her
haste
had
not
closed
the
door
everything
the
house
was
done
haste
that
time
and
pierre
and
anna
mikhaylovna
passing
instinctively
glanced
into
the
room
where
prince
vasili
and
the
eldest
princess
were
sitting
close
together
talking
seeing
them
pass
prince
vasili
drew
back
with
obvious
impatience
while
the
princess
jumped
and
with
gesture
desperation
slammed
the
door
with
all
her
might
this
action
was
unlike
her
usual
composure
and
the
fear
depicted
prince
vasili
face
out
keeping
with
his
dignity
that
pierre
stopped
and
glanced
inquiringly
over
his
spectacles
his
guide
anna
mikhaylovna
evinced
surprise
she
only
smiled
faintly
and
sighed
say
that
this
was
more
than
she
had
expected
man
friend
will
look
after
your
interests
said
she
reply
his
look
and
went
still
faster
along
the
passage
pierre
could
not
make
out
what
was
all
about
and
still
less
what
watching
over
his
interests
meant
but
decided
that
all
these
things
had
from
the
passage
they
went
into
large
dimly
lit
room
adjoining
the
count
reception
room
was
one
those
sumptuous
but
cold
apartments
known
pierre
only
from
the
front
approach
but
even
this
room
there
now
stood
empty
bath
and
water
had
been
spilled
the
carpet
they
were
met
deacon
with
censer
and
servant
who
passed
out
tiptoe
without
heeding
them
they
went
into
the
reception
room
familiar
pierre
with
two
italian
windows
opening
into
the
conservatory
with
its
large
bust
and
full
length
portrait
catherine
the
great
the
same
people
were
still
sitting
here
almost
the
same
positions
before
whispering
one
another
all
became
silent
and
turned
look
the
pale
tear
worn
anna
mikhaylovna
she
entered
and
the
big
stout
figure
pierre
who
hanging
his
head
meekly
followed
her
anna
mikhaylovna
face
expressed
consciousness
that
the
decisive
moment
had
arrived
with
the
air
practical
petersburg
lady
she
now
keeping
pierre
close
beside
her
entered
the
room
even
more
boldly
than
that
afternoon
she
felt
that
she
brought
with
her
the
person
the
dying
man
wished
see
her
own
admission
was
assured
casting
rapid
glance
all
those
the
room
and
noticing
the
count
confessor
there
she
glided
him
with
sort
amble
not
exactly
bowing
yet
seeming
grow
suddenly
smaller
and
respectfully
received
the
blessing
first
one
and
then
another
priest
god
thanked
that
you
are
time
said
she
one
the
priests
all
relatives
have
been
such
anxiety
this
young
man
the
count
son
she
added
more
softly
what
terrible
moment
having
said
this
she
went
the
doctor
dear
doctor
said
she
this
young
man
the
count
son
there
any
hope
the
doctor
cast
rapid
glance
upwards
and
silently
shrugged
his
shoulders
anna
mikhaylovna
with
just
the
same
movement
raised
her
shoulders
and
eyes
almost
closing
the
latter
sighed
and
moved
away
from
the
doctor
pierre
him
particularly
respectful
and
tenderly
sad
voice
she
said
trust
his
mercy
and
pointing
out
small
sofa
for
him
sit
and
wait
for
her
she
went
silently
toward
the
door
that
everyone
was
watching
and
creaked
very
slightly
she
disappeared
behind
pierre
having
made
his
mind
obey
his
monitress
implicitly
moved
toward
the
sofa
she
had
indicated
soon
anna
mikhaylovna
had
disappeared
noticed
that
the
eyes
all
the
room
turned
him
with
something
more
than
curiosity
and
sympathy
noticed
that
they
whispered
one
another
casting
significant
looks
him
with
kind
awe
and
even
servility
deference
such
had
never
before
received
was
shown
him
strange

the
one
who
had
been
talking

rose
and
offered
him

dropped
the

respectfully
silent

and
moved
make
way
for
him
first
pierre
wished
take
another
seat
not
trouble
the
lady
and
also
pick
the
glove
himself
and
pass
round
the
doctors
who
were
not
even
his
way
but
all
once
felt
that
this
would
not
and
that
tonight
was
person
obliged
perform
some
sort
awful
rite
which
everyone
expected
him
and
that
was
therefore
bound
accept
their
services
took
the
glove
silence
from
the
aide
camp
and
sat
down
the
lady
chair
placing
his
huge
hands
symmetrically
his
knees
the
naive
attitude
egyptian
statue
and
decided
his
own
mind
that
all
was
should
and
that
order
not
lose
his
head
and
foolish
things
must
not
act
his
own
ideas
tonight
but
must
yield
himself
entirely
the
will
those
who
were
guiding
him
not
two
minutes
had
passed
before
prince
vasili
with
head
erect
majestically
entered
the
room
was
wearing
his
long
coat
with
three
stars
his
breast
seemed
have
grown
thinner
since
the
morning
his
eyes
seemed
larger
than
usual
when
glanced
round
and
noticed
pierre

and
drew
downwards
wishing

asked

well
and
turned
but
pierre
thought
necessary
ask
how
and
hesitated
not
knowing
whether
would
proper
call
the
dying
man
the
count
yet
ashamed
call
him
father
had
another
stroke
about
half
hour
ago
courage

was
such
confused

that
the
word

suggested
him

and
only
later
grasped
that
stroke
was

illness
prince

said
something

and
went
through
the

not
walk

and
his
whole

jerked

him
and
the

and
some

also
went

last
anna

still
with
the

resolute

out
and
touching

lightly
the

said
the
divine

about

come
pierre
went
the
door
stepping
the
soft
carpet
and
noticed
that
the
strange
lady
the
aide

and
some
the
servants
all
followed
him
there
were
now
further
need
for
permission

the
familiar
majestic
figure
his
father
count
bezukhov
with
that
gray
mane
hair
above
his
broad
forehead
which
reminded
one
lion
and
the
deep
characteristically
noble
wrinkles
his
handsome
ruddy
face
lay
just
under
the
icons
his
large
thick
hands
outside
the
quilt
into
the
right
hand
which
was
lying
palm
downwards
wax

had
been
thrust
between
forefinger
and
thumb
and
old
servant
bending
over
from
behind
the

the

stood
the
priests
their
long
hair
falling
over
their
magnificent
glittering
vestments
with
lighted
tapers
their
hands
slowly
and
solemnly
conducting
the
service
little
behind
them
stood
the
two
younger
princesses
holding
handkerchiefs
their
eyes
and
just
front
them
their
eldest
sister
catiche
with
vicious
and
determined
look
steadily
fixed
the
icons
though
declaring
all
that
she
could
not
answer
for
herself
should
she
glance
round
anna

with
meek
sorrowful
and
all

the
carved
back
velvet
chair
had
turned
round
for
the
purpose
and
was
crossing
himself
with
his
right
hand
turning
his
eyes
upward
each
time
touched
his
forehead
his
face
wore
calm
look
piety
and
resignation
the
will

you
not
understand
these
sentiments
seemed
saying
much
the
worse
for
you
behind
him
stood
the
aide
camp
the
doctors
and
the
menservants
the
men
and
women
had
separated

all
were
silently
crossing
themselves
and
the
reading
the
church
service
the
subdued
chanting
deep
bass
voices
and
the
intervals
sighs
and
the
shuffling
feet
were
the
only
sounds
that
could
heard
anna
mikhaylovna
with
air
importance
that
showed
that
she
felt
she
quite
knew
what
she
was
about
went
across
the
room
where
pierre
was
standing
and
gave
him
taper
lit
and
distracted
observing
those
around
him
began
crossing
himself
with
the
hand
that
held
the
taper
sophie
the
rosy
laughter
loving
youngest
princess
with
the
mole
watched
him
she
smiled
hid
her
face
her
handkerchief
and
remained
with
hidden
for
awhile
then
looking
and
seeing
pierre
she
again
began
laugh
she
evidently
felt
unable
look
him
without
laughing
but
could
not
resist
looking
him
out
temptation
she
slipped
quietly
behind
one
the
columns
the
midst
the
service
the
voices
the
priests
suddenly
ceased
they
whispered
one
another
and
the
old
servant
who
was
holding
the
count
hand
got
and
said
something
the
ladies
anna
mikhaylovna
stepped
forward
and
stooping
over
the
dying
man
beckoned
lorrain
from
behind
her
back
the
french
doctor
held
taper
was
leaning
against
one
the
columns
respectful
attitude
implying
that
foreigner
spite
all
differences
faith
understood
the
full
importance
the
rite
now
being
performed
and
even
approved
now
approached
the
sick
man
with
the
noiseless
step
one
full
vigor
life
with
his
delicate
white
fingers
raised
from
the
green
quilt
the
hand
that
was
free
and
turning
sideways
felt
the
pulse
and
reflected
moment
the
sick
man
was
given
something
drink
there
was
stir
around
him
then
the
people
resumed
their
places
and
the
service
continued
during
this
interval
pierre
noticed
that
prince
vasili
left
the
chair
which
had
been
leaning
and
with
air
which
intimated
that
knew
what
was
about
and
others
did
not
understand
him
was
much
the
worse
for
them
did
not
the
dying
man
but
passed
him
joined
the
eldest
princess
and
moved
with
her
the
side
the
room
where
stood
the
high
bedstead
with
its
silken
hangings
leaving
the
bed
both
prince
vasili
and
the
princess
passed
out
back
door
but
returned
their
places
one
after
the
other
before
the
service
was
concluded
pierre
paid
more
attention
this
occurrence
than
the
rest
what
went
having
made
his
mind
once
for
all
that
what
saw
happening
around
him
that
evening
was
some
way
essential
the
chanting
the
service
ceased
and
the
voice
the
priest
was
heard
respectfully
congratulating
the
dying
man
having
received
the
sacrament
the
dying
man
lay
lifeless
and
immovable
before
around
him
everyone
began
stir
steps
were
audible
and
whispers
among
which
anna
mikhaylovna
was
the
most
distinct
pierre
heard
her
say
certainly
must
moved
onto
the
bed
here
will
impossible
the
sick
man
was
surrounded
doctors
princesses
and
servants
that
pierre
could
longer
see
the
reddish
yellow
face
with
its
gray
mane
which
though
saw
other
faces
well
had
not
lost
sight
for
single
moment
during
the
whole
service
judged
the
cautious
movements
those
who
crowded
round
the
invalid
chair
that
they
had
lifted
the
dying
man
and
were
moving
him
catch
hold
arm
you
drop
him
heard
one
the
servants
say
frightened
whisper
catch
hold
from
underneath
here
exclaimed
different
voices
and
the
heavy
breathing
the
bearers
and
the
shuffling
their
feet
grew
more
hurried
the
weight
they
were
carrying
were
too
much
for
them
the
bearers
among
whom
was
anna
mikhaylovna
passed
the
young
man
caught
momentary
glimpse
between
their
heads
and
backs
the
dying
man
high
stout
uncovered
chest
and
powerful
shoulders
raised
those
who
were
holding
him
under
the
armpits
and
his
gray
curly
leonine
head
this
head
with
its
remarkably
broad
brow
and
cheekbones
its
handsome
sensual
mouth
and
its
cold
majestic
expression
was
not
disfigured
the
approach
death
was
the
same
pierre
remembered
three
months
before
when
the
count
had
sent
him
petersburg
but
now
this
head
was
swaying
helplessly
with
the
uneven
movements
the
bearers
and
the
cold
listless
gaze
fixed
itself
upon
nothing
after
few
minutes
bustle
beside
the
high
bedstead
those
who
had
carried
the
sick
man
dispersed
anna
mikhaylovna
touched
pierre
hand
and
said
come
pierre
went
with
her
the
bed
which
the
sick
man
had
been
laid
stately
pose
keeping
with
the
ceremony
just
completed
lay
with
his
head
propped
high
the
pillows
his
hands
were
symmetrically
placed
the
green
silk
quilt
the
palms
downward
when
pierre
came
the
count
was
gazing
straight
him
but
with
look
the
significance
which
could
not
understood
mortal
man
either
this
look
meant
nothing
but
that
long
one
has
eyes
they
must
look
somewhere
meant
too
much
pierre
hesitated
not
knowing
what
and
glanced
inquiringly
his
guide
anna
mikhaylovna
made
hurried
sign
with
her
eyes
glancing
the
sick
man
hand
and
moving
her
lips
send
kiss
pierre
carefully
stretching
his
neck
not
touch
the
quilt
followed
her
suggestion
and
pressed
his
lips
the
large
boned
fleshy
hand
neither
the
hand
nor
single
muscle
the
count
face
stirred
once
more
pierre
looked
questioningly
anna
mikhaylovna
see
what
was
next
anna
mikhaylovna
with
her
eyes
indicated
chair
that
stood
beside
the
bed
pierre
obediently
sat
down
his
eyes
asking
were
doing
right
anna
mikhaylovna
nodded
approvingly
again
pierre
fell
into
the
naively
symmetrical
pose
egyptian
statue
evidently
distressed
that
his
stout
and
clumsy
body
took
much
room
and
doing
his
utmost
look
small
possible
looked
the
count
who
still
gazed
the
spot
where
pierre
face
had
been
before
sat
down
anna
mikhaylovna
indicated
her
attitude
her
consciousness
the
pathetic
importance
these
last
moments
meeting
between
the
father
and
son
this
lasted
about
two
minutes
which
pierre
seemed
hour
suddenly
the
broad
muscles
and
lines
the
count
face
began
twitch
the
twitching
increased
the
handsome
mouth
was
drawn
one
side
only
now
did
pierre
realize
how
near
death
his
father
was
and
from
that
distorted
mouth
issued
indistinct
hoarse
sound
anna
mikhaylovna
looked
attentively
the
sick
man
eyes
trying
guess
what
wanted
she
pointed
first
pierre
then
some
drink
then
named
prince
vasili
inquiring
whisper
then
pointed
the
quilt
the
eyes
and
face
the
sick
man
showed
impatience
made
effort
look
the

who
stood
constantly
the

the

whispered
the
servant
and
got

the
count
heavy
body
toward
the
wall
pierre
rose
help
him
while
the
count
was
being
turned
over
one
his
arms
fell
back
helplessly
and
made
fruitless
effort
pull
forward
whether
noticed
the
look
terror
with
which
pierre
regarded
that
lifeless
arm
whether
some
other
thought
flitted
across
his
dying
brain
any
rate
glanced
the
refractory
arm
pierre
terror
stricken
face
and
again
the
arm
and
his
face
feeble
piteous
smile
appeared
quite
out
keeping
with
his
features
that
seemed
deride
his
own
helplessness
sight
this
smile
pierre
felt
unexpected
quivering
his
breast
and
tickling
his
nose
and
tears
dimmed
his
eyes
the
sick
man
was
turned
his
side
with
his
face
the
wall
sighed
dozing
said
anna
mikhaylovna
observing
that
one
the
princesses
was
coming
take
her
turn
watching
let
pierre
went
out
chapter

and
the

were
sitting
under
the
portrait
catherine
the
great
and
talking
eagerly
soon
they
saw
pierre
and
his
companion
they
became
silent
and
pierre
thought
saw
the
princess
hide
something
she
whispered

bear
the
sight

giving
his
arm
sympathetic
squeeze
below
the
shoulder
pierre
went
with

into
the

sitting
this
room
watch
the
ladies
who
they
passed
through
their
ball
dresses
with
diamonds
and
pearls
their
bare
shoulders
looked
themselves
the
brilliantly
lighted
mirrors
which
repeated
their
reflections
several
times
now
this
same
room
was
dimly
lighted
two
candles
one
small
table
tea
things
and
supper
dishes
stood
disorder
and
the
middle
the
night
motley
throng
people
sat
there
not
merrymaking
but
somberly
whispering
and
betraying
every
word
and
movement
that
they
none
them
forgot
what
was
happening
and
what
was
about
happen
the
bedroom
pierre
did
not
eat
anything
though
would
very
much
have
liked
looked
inquiringly
his
monitress
and
saw
that
she
was
again
going
tiptoe
the
reception
room
where
they
had
left
prince
vasili
and
the
eldest
princess
pierre
concluded
that
this
also
was
essential
and
after
short
interval
followed
her
anna
mikhaylovna
was
standing
beside
the
princess
and
they
were
both
speaking
excited
whispers
permit
princess
know
what
necessary
and
what
not
necessary
said
the
younger
the
two
speakers
evidently
the
same
state
excitement
when
she
had
slammed
the
door
her
room
but
dear
princess
answered
anna
mikhaylovna
blandly
but
impressively
blocking
the
way
the
bedroom
and
preventing
the
other
from
passing
won
this
too
much
for
poor
uncle
moment
when
needs
repose
worldly
conversation
moment
when
his
soul
already
prepared
prince
vasili
was
seated
easy
chair
his
familiar
attitude
with
one
leg
crossed
high
above
the
other
his
cheeks
which
were
flabby
that
they
looked
heavier
below
were
twitching
violently
but
wore
the
air
man
little
concerned
what
the
two
ladies
were
saying
come

anna
mikhaylovna

catiche
she

you

how

the

addressing

and
pointing

she
held
her
hand
all

that

she
tried

but
the
latter
sprang
bar
her
path
know
dear
kind
princess
said
anna
mikhaylovna
seizing
the

firmly
that

princess
beg
and
implore
you
have
some
pity

vous
conjure
the
princess
did
not
reply
their
efforts
the
struggle
for
the
portfolio
were
the
only
sounds
audible
but
was
evident
that
the
princess
did
speak
her
words
would
not
flattering
anna
mikhaylovna
though
the
latter
held
tenaciously
her
voice
lost
none
its
honeyed
firmness
and
softness
pierre

suddenly
shrieked
the
princess
loud
that
those
the
drawing
room
heard
her
and
were
startled
why
you
remain
silent
when
heaven
knows
who
permits

very
threshold
dying
man

intriguer
she
hissed
viciously
and
tugged
with
all
her

but
anna

went

said
with
reproach
and
surprise

did
not

said
she
turning
the
young
man
who
having
come
quite
close
was
gazing
with
astonishment
the
angry
face
the
princess
which
had
lost
all
dignity
and
the
twitching
cheeks
prince
vasili
remember
that
you
will
answer
for
the
consequences
said
prince
vasili
severely
you
don
know
what
you
are
doing
vile
woman
shouted
the
princess
darting
unexpectedly
anna
mikhaylovna
and
snatching
the
portfolio
from
her
prince
vasili
bent
his
head
and
spread
out
his
hands
this
moment
that
terrible
door
which
pierre
had
watched
long
and
which
had
always
opened
quietly
burst
noisily
open
and
banged
against
the
wall
and
the
second
the
three
sisters
rushed
out
wringing
her
hands
what
are
you
doing
she
cried
vehemently
dying
and
you
leave
alone
with
him
her
sister
dropped
the
portfolio
anna
mikhaylovna
stooping
quickly
caught
the
object
contention
and
ran
into
the
bedroom
the
eldest
princess
and
prince
vasili
recovering
themselves
followed
her
few
minutes
later
the
eldest
sister
came
out
with
pale
hard
face
again
biting
her
underlip

pierre
her
expression
showed
irrepressible
hatred

said
she
this
what
you
have
been
waiting
for
and
bursting
into
tears
she
hid
her
face
her
handkerchief
and
rushed
from
the
room
prince
vasili
came
next
staggered
the
sofa
which
pierre
was
sitting
and
dropped
onto
covering
his
face
with
his
hand
pierre
noticed
that
was
pale
and
that
his
jaw
quivered
and
shook
ague

said
taking
pierre
the
elbow
and
there
was
his
voice
sincerity
and
weakness
pierre
had
never
observed
before
how
often
sin
how
much
deceive
and
all
for
what
near
sixty

and
burst
into

anna

came
out

she
approached
pierre
with
slow
quiet
steps
pierre
she
said
pierre
gave
her
inquiring
look
she
kissed
the
young
man
his
forehead
wetting
him
with
her
tears
then
after
pause
she
said
more
pierre
looked
her
over
his
spectacles
come

with
you
try
weep
nothing

such
relief
tears
she
led
him
into
the
dark
drawing
room
and
pierre
was
glad
one
could
see
his
face
anna
mikhaylovna
left
him
and
when
she
returned
was
fast
asleep
with
his
head
his
arm
the
morning
anna
mikhaylovna
said
pierre

which
moved
noiselessly
and
easily
she
paused
the

the
prince
was
working
the
lathe
and
after
glancing
round
continued
his
work
the
enormous

was
full

with

the
motion
the
small
foot
shod

embroidered
with
silver
and
the

sinewy
hand
showed
that
the

still
possessed
the
tenacious
endurance
and
vigor
hardy
old
age
after
few
more
turns
the
lathe
removed
his
foot
from

into

and
approaching

summoned
his

out
his
bristly

yet
unshaven
and
regarding

his

placing

she
sat

felt
herself
surrounded

had
known

eyes
glittering
close
her
the
red
patches
her
face
came
and
went
and
was
plain
that
she
understood
nothing
and
was
frightened
that
her
fear
would
prevent
her
understanding
any
her
father
further
explanations
however
clear
they
might
whether

the
pupil
this

thing
happened
every
day
the
princess
eyes
grew
dim
she
could
not
see
and
could
not
hear
anything
but
was
only
conscious
her
stern
father
withered
face
close
her
his
breath
and
the
smell
him
and
could
think
only
how
get
away
quickly
her
own
room
make
out
the
problem
peace
the
old
man
was
beside
himself
moved
the
chair
which
was
sitting
noisily
backward
and
forward
made
efforts
control
himself
and
not
become
vehement
but
almost
always
did
become
vehement
scolded
and
sometimes
flung
the
exercise
book
away
the
princess
gave
wrong
answer

the

the

aside
and
turning
sharply
away

shoulder
and
himself
closed
the

after
her
princess
mary
went
back
her
room
with
the
sad
scared
expression
that
rarely
left
her
and
which
made
her
plain
sickly
face
yet
plainer
she
sat
down
her
writing
table
which
stood
miniature
portraits
and
which
was
littered
with
books
and
papers
the
princess
was
untidy
her
father
was
tidy
she
put
down
the
geometry
book
and
eagerly
broke
the

sighed
and
glanced
into
the
mirror
which
stood

weak
ungraceful
figure
and
thin
face
her
eyes
always
sad
now
looked
with
particular
hopelessness
her

the

turning
away
and
continuing

but
julie
did
not
flatter
her

the

large
deep
and
luminous
seemed

from

were
beautiful
that
very
often
spite
the
plainness
her
face
they
gave
her
attraction
more
powerful
than
that
beauty
but
the
princess
never
saw
the
beautiful
expression
her
own

look
they
had
when
she
was
not

confess
you

great
grief

and
full
that
real
youthfulness
which
one
seldom
finds
nowadays
among
our
old
men
twenty
and
particularly
frank
and
has
much
heart
pure
and
poetic
that
relations

amused
themselves
finding
husbands

adieu

and
compliments
mademoiselle
bourienne
embrace
you
love
you
julie
let
have
news
your
brother
and
his
charming
little
wife
the
princess
pondered
awhile
with
thoughtful
smile
and
her
luminous
eyes
lit
that
her
face
was
entirely
transformed
then
she
suddenly
rose
and
with
her
heavy
tread
went
the
table
she
took
sheet
paper
and
her
hand
moved
rapidly
over
this
the
reply
she
wrote
also
french
dear
and
precious
friend
your
letter
the
has
given
great
delight
you
still
love
romantic
julie
separation
which
you
say
much
that
bad
does
not
seem
have
had
its
usual
effect
you
you
complain
our
separation
what
then
should
say
dared
complain
who
deprived
all
who
are
dear
had
not
religion
console
life
would
very
sad
why
you
suppose
that
should
look
severely
your
affection
for
that
young
man
such
matters
only
severe
with
myself
understand
such
feelings
others
and
never
having
felt
them
cannot
approve
them
neither
condemn
them
only
seems
that
christian
love
love
one
neighbor
love
one
enemy
worthier
sweeter
and
better
than
the
feelings
which
the
beautiful
eyes
young
man
can
inspire
romantic
and
loving
young
girl
like
yourself
the
news
count
bezukhov
death
reached
before
your
letter
and
father
was
much
affected
says
the
count
was
the
last
representative
but
one
the
great
century
and
that
his
own
turn
now
but
that
will
all
can
let
his
turn
come
late
possible
god
preserve
from
that
terrible
misfortune
cannot
agree
with
you
about
pierre
whom
knew
child
always
seemed
have
excellent
heart
and
that
the
quality
value
most
people
his
inheritance
and
the
part
played
prince
vasili
very
sad
for
both
dear
friend
our
divine
saviour
words
that
easier
for
camel
through
the
eye
needle
than
for
rich
man
enter
the
kingdom
god
are
terribly
true
pity
prince
vasili
but
still
more
sorry
for
pierre
young
and
burdened
with
such
riches
what
temptations
will
exposed
were
asked
what
desire
most
earth
would
poorer
than
the
poorest
beggar
thousand
thanks
dear
friend
for
the
volume
you
have
sent
and
which
has
such
success
moscow
yet
since
you
tell
that
among
some
good
things
contains
others
which
our
weak
human
understanding
cannot
grasp
seems
rather
useless
spend
time
reading
what
unintelligible
and
can
therefore
bear
fruit
never
could
understand
the
fondness
some
people
have
for
confusing
their
minds
dwelling
mystical
books
that
merely
awaken
their
doubts
and
excite
their
imagination
giving
them
bent
for
exaggeration
quite
contrary
christian
simplicity
let
rather
read
the
epistles
and
gospels
let
not
seek
penetrate
what
mysteries
they
contain
for
how
can
miserable
sinners
that
are
know
the
terrible
and
holy
secrets
providence
while
remain
this
flesh
which
forms
impenetrable
veil
between
and
the
eternal
let
rather
confine
ourselves
studying
those
sublime
rules
which
our
divine
saviour
has
left
for
our
guidance
here
below
let
try
conform
them
and
follow
them
and
let
persuaded
that
the
less
let
our
feeble
human
minds
roam
the
better
shall
please
god
who
rejects
all
knowledge
that
does
not
come
from
him
and
the
less
seek
fathom
what
has
been
pleased
conceal
from
the
sooner
will
vouchsafe
its
revelation
through
his
divine
spirit
father
has
not
spoken
suitor
but
has
only
told
that
has
received
letter
and
expecting
visit
from
prince
vasili
regard
this
project
marriage
for
will
tell
you
dear
sweet
friend

upon

without
disquieting
myself
examining

toward

give
for

had
letter
from

who
announces
his
speedy
arrival
bald
hills
with
his

this
pleasure

but
brief
one
however
for
will
leave
again
take
part
this
unhappy
war
into
which
have
been
drawn
god
knows
how
why
not
only
where
you
are
the
heart
affairs
and
the
world
the
talk
all
war
even
here
amid
fieldwork
and
the
calm
nature
which
townsfolk
consider
characteristic
the
country
rumors
war
are
heard
and
painfully
felt
father
talks
nothing
but
marches
and
countermarches
things
which
understand
nothing
and
the
day
before
yesterday
during
daily
walk
through
the
village
witnessed
heartrending
scene
was
convoy
conscripts
enrolled
from
our
people
and
starting
join
the
army
you
should
have
seen
the
state
the
mothers
wives
and
children
the
men
who
were
going
and
should
have
heard
the
sobs
seems
though
mankind
has
forgotten
the
laws
its
divine
saviour
who
preached
love
and
forgiveness
injuries
and
that
men
attribute
the
greatest
merit

with
guttural
she

mournful
and
gloomy
world
quite
different
atmosphere
careless
lighthearted
and
self
satisfied
princess
must
warn
you
she
added
lowering
her
voice
and
evidently
listening
herself
with
pleasure
and
speaking
with
exaggerated
grasseyement

the
princess
glanced
her
watch
and
seeing
that
she
was
five
minutes
late
starting
her
practice
the

and
two

mapped
out
the
prince
rested
and
the
princess
played
the
clavichord
chapter
xxvi
the
gray
haired
valet
was
sitting
drowsily
listening
the
snoring
the
prince
who
was
his
large
study
from
the
far
side
the
house
through
the
closed
doors
came
the
sound
difficult
passages
twenty
times
repeated
sonata
dussek
just
then
closed

and
another
with
hood
drove
the
porch
prince
andrew
got
out

carriage
helped
his
little
wife

and
let
her
pass
into

him
old
tikhon
wearing
wig
put
his
head
out
the
door
the
antechamber
reported
whisper
that
the
prince
was
sleeping
and
hastily
closed
the
door
tikhon
knew
that
neither
the
son

nor
any
other
unusual
event
must
allowed
disturb
the
appointed
order
the
day
prince
andrew
apparently
knew
this
well
tikhon
looked
his
watch
ascertain
whether
his
father

had
changed
since

home
last
and
having
assured
himself
that
they
had
not
turned
his
wife
will
get
twenty
minutes
let
across
mary
room
said
the
little
princess
had
grown
stouter
during
this
time
but
her
eyes
and
her
short
downy
smiling
lip
lifted
when
she
began
speak
just
merrily
and
prettily
ever
why
this
palace
she
said
her
husband
looking
around
with
the
expression
with
which
people
compliment
their
host
ball
let
come
quick
quick
and
with
glance
round
she
smiled
tikhon
her
husband
and
the
footman
who
accompanied
them
that
mary
practicing
let
quietly
and
take
her
surprise
prince
andrew
followed
her
with
courteous
but
sad
expression
you
grown
older
tikhon
said
passing
the
old
man
who
kissed
his
hand
before
they
reached
the
room
from
which
the
sounds
the
clavichord
came
the
pretty
fair
haired
frenchwoman
mademoiselle
bourienne
rushed
out
apparently
beside
herself
with
delight
what
joy
for
the
princess
exclaimed
she
last
must
let
her
know
please
not
you
are
mademoiselle
bourienne
said
the
little
princess
kissing
her
know
you
already
through
sister
law
friendship
for
you
she
was
not
expecting
they
went
the
door
the
sitting
room
from
which
came
the
sound
the
oft
repeated
passage
the
sonata
prince
andrew
stopped
and
made
grimace
expecting
something
unpleasant
the
little
princess
entered
the
room
the
passage
broke
off
the
middle
cry
was
heard
then
princess
mary
heavy
tread
and
the
sound
kissing
when
prince
andrew
went
the
two
princesses
who
had
only
met
once
before
for
short
time
his
wedding
were
each
other
arms
warmly
pressing
their
lips
whatever
place
they
happened
touch
mademoiselle
bourienne
stood
near
them
pressing
her
hand
her
heart
with
beatific
smile
and
obviously
equally
ready
cry
laugh
prince
andrew
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
frowned
lovers
music
when
they
hear
false
note
the
two
women
let
one
another
and
then
afraid
being
too
late
seized
each
other
hands
kissing
them
and
pulling
them
away
and
again
began
kissing
each
other
the
face
and
then
prince
andrew
surprise
both
began
cry
and
kissed
again
mademoiselle
bourienne
also
began
cry
prince
andrew
evidently
felt
ill
ease
but
the
two
women
seemed
quite
natural
that
they
should
cry
and
apparently
never
entered
their
heads
that
could
have
been
otherwise
this
meeting
dear
mary
they
suddenly
exclaimed
and
then
laughed
dreamed
last
night
you
were
not
expecting
mary

have
got
thinner
and
you
have
grown
stouter
knew
the
princess
once
put
mademoiselle

and
had
idea
exclaimed
princess
mary
andrew
did
not
see
you
prince
andrew
and
his
sister
hand
hand
kissed
one
another
and
told
her
she
was
still
the
same
crybaby
ever
princess
mary
had
turned
toward
her
brother
and
through
her
tears
the
loving
warm
gentle
look
her
large
luminous
eyes
very
beautiful
that
moment
rested
prince
andrew
face
the
little
princess
talked
incessantly
her
short
downy
upper
lip
continually
and
rapidly
touching
her
rosy
nether
lip
when
necessary
and
drawing
again
next
moment
when
her
face
broke
into
smile
glittering
teeth
and
sparkling
eyes
she
told
accident
they
had
had
the
spasski
hill
which
might
have
been
serious
for
her
her
condition
and
immediately
after
that
informed
them
that
she
had
left
all
her
clothes
petersburg
and
that
heaven
knew
what
she
would
have
dress
here
and
that
andrew
had
quite
changed
and
that
kitty
odyntsova
had
married
old
man
and
that
there
was
suitor
for
mary
real
one
but
that
they
would
talk
that
later
princess
mary
was
still
looking
silently
her
brother
and
her
beautiful
eyes
were
full
love
and
sadness
was
plain
that
she
was
following
train
thought
independent
her
sister
law
words
the
midst
description
the
last
petersburg
fete
she
addressed
her
brother

said
sighing
lise
sighed
too
yes

even

replied
her
brother
leaving
here
god
knows
why
when
might
have
had
promotion
princess
mary
did
not
listen
the
end
but
continuing
her
train
thought
turned
her
sister
law
with
tender
glance
her
figure
certain
she
said
the
face
the
little
princess
changed
she
sighed
and
said
yes
quite
certain
very
dreadful
her
lip
descended
she
brought
her
face
close
her
sister
law
and
unexpectedly
again
began
cry
she
needs
rest
said
prince
andrew
with
frown
don

room

father
how
just
the
same
yes

the
same
though

answered
the
princess
joyfully
and
are
the
hours
the
same
and
the
walks
the
avenues
and
the
lathe
asked
prince
andrew
with
scarcely
perceptible
smile
which
showed
that
spite
all
his
love
and
respect
for
his
father
was
aware
his
weaknesses
the
hours
are
the
same
and
the
lathe
and
also
the
mathematics
and
geometry
lessons
said
princess
mary
gleefully
her
lessons
geometry
were
among
the
greatest
delights
her
life
when
the
twenty
minutes
had
elapsed
and
the
time

come

with

his

were
already
awaiting

his

was
admitted
table
though
the
position
that
insignificant
individual
was
such
could
certainly
not
have
caused
him

that
honor
the
prince
who
generally
kept
very
strictly
social
distinctions
and
rarely
admitted
even
important
government
officials
his

had
unexpectedly
selected
michael

who
always
went
into
corner

his
nose
his
checked
handkerchief
illustrate
the
theory
that
all

and
had
more
than

impressed
his

that
michael

was
not

worse
than
you

the
prince
usually
spoke
the
taciturn
michael
ivanovich
more
often
than
anyone
else
the
dining
room
which
like
all
the
rooms
the
house
was
exceedingly
lofty

looking

princess
mary
could
not
understand
the
boldness

brother
criticism
and
was
about
reply
when
the
expected
footsteps
were
heard
coming
from
the
study
the
prince
walked
quickly
and
jauntily
was
his
wont
intentionally
contrasting
the
briskness
his
manners
with
the
strict
formality
his
house
that
moment
the
great
clock
struck
two
and
another
with
shrill
tone
joined
from
the
drawing
room
the
prince
stood
still
his
lively
glittering
eyes
from
under
their
thick
bushy
eyebrows
sternly
scanned
all
present
and
rested
the
little
princess

felt
courtiers
when

and
respect

said
the
little
princess
did
not
did
not
wish
hear
his
words
she
was
silent
and
seemed
confused
the
prince
asked
her
about
her
father
and
she
began
smile
and
talk
asked
about
mutual
acquaintances
and
she
became
still
more
animated
and
chattered
away
giving
him
greetings
from
various
people
and
retelling

looked

more
and
more

and
suddenly
had
studied
her
sufficiently
and
had
formed
definite
idea

turned
away
and
addressed

andrew
always

while
you
and
never
thought
much
him
michael
ivanovich
did
not
all
know
when
you
and
had
said
such
things
about
bonaparte
but
understanding
that
was
wanted
peg
which
hang
the
prince
favorite
topic
looked
inquiringly
the
young
prince
wondering
what
would
follow
great
tactician
said
the
prince
his
son
pointing
the
architect
and
the
conversation
again
turned
the
war
bonaparte
and
the
generals
and
statesmen
the
day
the
old
prince
seemed
convinced
not
only
that
all
the
men
the
day
were
mere
babies
who
did
not
know
the
war
politics
and
that
bonaparte
was
insignificant
little
frenchy
successful
only
because
there
were
longer
any
potemkins
suvorovs
left
oppose
him
but
was
also
convinced
that
there
were
political
difficulties
europe
and
real
war
but
only
sort
puppet
show
which
the
men
the
day
were
playing
pretending
something
real
prince
andrew
gaily
bore
with
his
father
ridicule
the
new
men
and
drew
him
and
listened
him
with
evident
pleasure
the
past
always
seems
good
said
but
did
not
suvorov
himself
fall
into
trap
moreau
set
him
and
from
which
did
not
know
how
escape
who

away

tikhon

said
prince
andrew
only
surprised
your
opinion
bonaparte
you
may
laugh
much
you
like
but
all
the
same
bonaparte
great
general
michael
ivanovich
cried
the
old
prince
the
architect
who
busy
with
his
roast
meat
hoped
had
been
forgotten
didn
tell
you
buonaparte
was
great
tactician
here
says
the
same
thing
sure
your
excellency
replied
the
architect
the
prince
again
laughed
his
frigid
laugh
buonaparte
was
born
with
silver
spoon
his
mouth
has
got
splendid
soldiers
besides
began
attacking
germans
and
only
idlers
have
failed
beat
the
germans
since
the
world
began
everybody
has
beaten
the
germans
they
beat
one
except
one
another
made
his
reputation
fighting
them
and
the
prince
began
explaining
all
the
blunders
which
according
him
bonaparte
had
made
his
campaigns
and
even
politics
his
son
made
rejoinder
but
was
evident
that
whatever
arguments
were
presented
was
little
able
his
father
change
his
opinion
listened
refraining
from
reply
and
involuntarily
wondered
how
this
old
man
living
alone
the
country
for
many
years
could
know
and
discuss
minutely
and
acutely
all
the
recent
european
military
and
political
events
you
think
old
man
and
don
understand
the
present
state
affairs
concluded
his
father
but
troubles
don
sleep
night
come
now
where
has
this
great
commander
yours
shown
his
skill
concluded
that
would
take
too
long
tell
answered
the
son
well
then
your
buonaparte
mademoiselle
bourienne
here
another
admirer
that
powder
monkey
emperor
yours
exclaimed
excellent
french
you
know
prince
not
bonapartist
dieu
sait
quand
reviendra
hummed
the
prince
out
tune
and
with
laugh
still
more
quitted
the
table
the
little
princess
during
the
whole
discussion
and
the
rest
the
dinner
sat
silent
glancing
with
frightened
look
now
her
father
law
and
now
princess
mary
when
they
left
the
table
she
took
her
sister
law
arm
and
drew
her
into
another
room
what
clever
man
your
father
said
she
perhaps
that
why

and
thoughtfully

rather
than
the
trend

conversation
and
that

prince
andrew
had
gone
and
made
the
sign
the
cross
his

from

like

shots
came
the
frequent
sound
the
old
man
angrily
blowing
his
nose
hardly
had
prince
andrew
gone
when
the
study
door
opened
quickly
and
the
stern
figure
the
old
man
the
white
dressing
gown
looked
out
gone
that
all
right
said
and
looking
angrily
the
unconscious
little

reprovingly
and

other

freshly
arriving

settling
near
the

the
commander

despite
the
russian
appearance
the
locality
and
surroundings
fruit
gardens
stone
fences
tiled
roofs
and
hills
the
distance
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
inhabitants
who
gazed
with
curiosity
the
soldiers
were
not
russians
the
regiment
had
just
the
appearance
any
russian
regiment
preparing
for
inspection
anywhere
the
heart
russia
the
evening
the
last
day
march
order
had
been
received
that
the
commander
chief
would
inspect
the
regiment
the
march
though
the
words
the
order
were
not
clear
the
regimental
commander
and
the
question
arose
whether
the
troops
were
marching

not
was
decided
consultation
between
the
battalion
commanders
present
the
regiment
parade
order
the
principle
that
always
better
bow
too
low
than
not
bow
low
enough
the
soldiers
after
twenty
mile
march
were
kept
mending
and
cleaning
all
night
long
without
closing
their
eyes
while
the
adjutants
and
company
commanders
calculated
and
reckoned
and
morning
the

instead
the
straggling
disorderly
crowd
had
been
its
last

the
day
before
presented
well
ordered
array
two
thousand
men
each
whom
knew
his
place
and
his
duty
had
every
button
and
every
strap
place
and
shone
with
cleanliness
and
not
only
externally
was
all
order
but
had
pleased
the

look
under

would
have
found
every
man
clean
shirt
and
every
knapsack
the
appointed
number
articles
awl
soap
and
all
the
soldiers
say
there
was
only
one
circumstance
concerning
which
one
could
ease
was
the
state
the
soldiers
boots
more
than
half
the
men
boots
were
holes
but
this
defect
was
not
due
any
fault
the
regimental
commander
for
spite
repeated
demands
boots
had
not
been
issued
the
austrian
commissariat
and
the
regiment
had
marched
some
seven
hundred
miles
the
commander
the
regiment
was
elderly
choleric
stout
and
thick
set
general
with
grizzled
eyebrows
and
whiskers
and
wider
from
chest
back
than
across
the
shoulders
had
brand
new
uniform
showing
the
creases
where
had
been
folded
and
thick
gold
epaulettes
which
seemed
stand
rather
than
lie
down
his
massive
shoulders
had
the
air
man
happily
performing
one
the
most
solemn
duties
his
life
walked
about
front
the
line
and
every
step
pulled
himself
slightly
arching
his
back
was
plain
that
the
commander
admired
his
regiment
rejoiced
and
that
his
whole
mind
was
engrossed
yet
his
strut
seemed
indicate
that
besides
military
matters
social
interests
and
the
fair
sex
occupied
small
part
his
thoughts
well
michael
mitrich

not
considering
this

arguments

the
wretched
state
which
the
troops
arrived
from

with
this
object

the
worse
the
condition
was
the
better
pleased
the

did
not

these
circumstances
nevertheless
delivered
the
definite
order

the

says
word

and
you
what
added
with
renewed
irritation
beg

your
men
decently
and
the
commander
turning
look
the
adjutant
directed
his
jerky
steps
down
the
line
was
evidently
pleased
his
own
display
anger
and
walking
the
regiment
wished
find
further
excuse
for
wrath
having
snapped
officer

unpolished
badge

because
his
line
was
not
straight
reached
the
third
company
are

standing
where
your
leg

leg
shouted
the
commander
with
tone
suffering
his
voice
while
there
were
still
five
men
between
him
and
dolokhov
with
his
bluish
gray
uniform
dolokhov
slowly
straightened
his
bent
knee
looking
straight
with
his
clear
insolent
eyes
the
general
face
why
blue

dolokhov
hurriedly
interrupted
talking
the
ranks
talking
talking
not
bound
endure
insults
dolokhov
concluded
loud
ringing
tones
the
eyes
the
general
and
the
soldier
met
the
general
became
silent
angrily
pulling
down
his
tight
scarf
request
you
have
the
goodness
change
your
coat
said
turned
away
chapter
coming
shouted
the
signaler
that
moment
the
regimental
commander
flushing
ran
his
horse
seized
the
stirrup
with
trembling
hands
threw
his
body
across
the
saddle
righted
himself
drew
his
saber
and
with
happy
and
resolute
countenance
opening
his
mouth
awry
prepared
shout
the
regiment
fluttered
like
bird
preening
its
plumage
and
became
motionless
att
ention
shouted
the
regimental
commander
soul
shaking
voice
which
expressed
joy
for
himself
severity
for
the
regiment
and
welcome
for
the
approaching
chief
along
the
broad
country
road
edged
both
sides
trees
came
high
light
blue
viennese
caleche
slightly
creaking
its
springs
and
drawn
six
horses
smart
trot
behind
the
caleche
galloped
the
suite
and
convoy
croats
beside
kutuzov
sat
austrian
general
white
uniform
that
looked
strange
among
the
russian
black
ones
the
caleche
stopped
front
the
regiment
kutuzov
and
the
austrian
general
were
talking
low
voices
and
kutuzov
smiled
slightly
treading
heavily
stepped
down
from
the
carriage
just
those
two
thousand
men
breathlessly
gazing
him
and
the
regimental
commander
did
not
exist
the
word
command
rang
out
and
again
the
regiment
quivered
with
jingling
sound
presented
arms
then
amidst
dead
silence
the
feeble
voice
the
commander
chief
was
heard
the
regiment
roared
health
your
len
len
lency
and
again
all
became
silent
first
kutuzov
stood
still
while
the
regiment
moved
then
and
the
general
white
accompanied
the
suite
walked
between
the
ranks
from
the
way
the
regimental
commander
saluted
the
commander
chief
and
devoured
him
with
his
eyes
drawing
himself
obsequiously
and
from
the
way
walked
through
the
ranks
behind
the
generals
bending
forward
and
hardly
able
restrain
his
jerky
movements
and
from
the
way
darted
forward
every
word
gesture
the
commander
chief
was
evident
that
performed
his
duty
subordinate
with
even
greater
zeal
than
his
duty
commander
thanks
the
strictness
and
assiduity
its
commander
the
regiment
comparison
with
others
that
had
reached
braunau
the
same
time
was
splendid
condition
there
were
only
sick
and
stragglers
everything
was
good
order
except
the
boots
kutuzov
walked
through
the
ranks
sometimes
stopping
say
few
friendly
words
officers
had
known
the
turkish
war
sometimes
also
the
soldiers
looking
their
boots
several
times
shook
his
head
sadly
pointing
them
out
the
austrian
general
with
expression
which
seemed
say
that
was
not
blaming
anyone
but
could
not
help
noticing
what
bad
state
things
was
the
regimental
commander
ran
forward
each
such
occasion
fearing
miss
single
word
the
commander
chief
regarding
the
regiment
behind
kutuzov
distance
that
allowed
every
softly
spoken
word
heard
followed
some
twenty
men
his
suite
these
gentlemen
talked
among
themselves
and
sometimes
laughed
nearest
all
the
commander
chief
walked
handsome
adjutant
this
was
prince
bolkonski
beside
him
was
his
comrade
nesvitski
tall
staff
officer
extremely
stout
with
kindly
smiling
handsome
face
and
moist
eyes
nesvitski
could
hardly
keep
from
laughter
provoked
swarthy
hussar
officer
who
walked
beside
him
this
hussar
with
grave
face
and
without
smile
change
the
expression
his
fixed
eyes
watched
the
regimental
commander
back
and
mimicked
his
every
movement
each
time
the
commander
started
and
bent
forward
the
hussar
started
and
bent
forward
exactly
the
same
manner
nesvitski
laughed
and
nudged
the
others
make
them
look
the
wag
kutuzov
walked
slowly
and
languidly
past
thousands
eyes
which
were
starting
from
their
sockets
watch
their
chief
reaching
the
third
company
suddenly
stopped
his
suite
not
having
expected
this
involuntarily
came
closer
him
timokhin
said
recognizing
the
red
nosed
captain
who
had
been
reprimanded
account
the
blue
greatcoat
one
would
have
thought
impossible
for
man
stretch
himself
more
than
timokhin
had
done
when
was
reprimanded
the
regimental
commander
but
now
that
the
commander
chief
addressed
him
drew
himself
such
extent
that
seemed
could
not
have
sustained
had
the
commander
chief
continued
look
him
and
kutuzov
who
evidently
understood
his
case
and
wished
him
nothing
but
good
quickly
turned
away
scarcely
perceptible
smile
flitting
over
his
scarred
and
puffy
face
another
ismail
comrade
said
brave
officer
are
you
satisfied
with
him
asked
the
regimental
commander
and
the
latter
unconscious
that
was
being
reflected
the
hussar
officer
looking
glass
started
moved
forward
and
answered
highly
satisfied
your
excellency
all
have
our
weaknesses
said
kutuzov
smiling
and
walking
away
from
him
used
have
predilection
for
bacchus
the
regimental
commander
was
afraid
might
blamed
for
this
and
did
not
answer
the
hussar
that
moment
noticed
the
face
the
red
nosed
captain
and
his
drawn
stomach
and
mimicked
his
expression
and
pose
with
such
exactitude
that
nesvitski
could
not
help
laughing
kutuzov
turned
round
the
officer
evidently
had
complete
control
his
face
and
while
kutuzov
was
turning
managed
make
grimace
and
then
assume
most
serious
deferential
and
innocent
expression
the
third
company
was
the
last
and
kutuzov
pondered
apparently
trying
recollect
something
prince
andrew
stepped
forward
from
among
the
suite
and
said
french
you
told
remind
you
the
officer
dolokhov
reduced
the

dolokhov
asked

the

and
presented

with
slight
frown

kutuzov

will

emperor
gracious
and
shan
forget
you

deserve
well
the
clear
blue
eyes
looked
the
commander
chief
just
boldly
they
had
looked
the
regimental
commander
seeming
their
expression
tear
open
the
veil
convention
that
separates
commander
chief
widely
from
private
one

his
firm
ringing
deliberate
voice

for

emperor
and

kutuzov
turned
away
the
same
smile
the
eyes
with
which
had
turned
from
captain
timokhin
again
flitted
over
his
face
turned
away
with
grimace
say
that
everything
dolokhov
had
said
him
and
everything
could
say
had
long
been
known
him
that
was
weary
and
was
not
all
what
wanted
turned
away
and
went
the
carriage
the
regiment
broke
into
companies
which
went
their
appointed
quarters
near
braunau
where
they
hoped
receive
boots
and
clothes
and
rest
after
their
hard
marches

dolokhov

round

flourishing

this

now

the
only
change
being
that
the

waved
his

the

lean

looked
sternly
the

screwed
his

then
having
satisfied
himself
that
all

were
fixed
him
raised
both
arms
carefully
lifting
some
invisible
but
precious
object
above
his
head
and
holding
there
for
some
seconds
suddenly
flung

began

the

spite
the
burden

rushed
out

walking
backwards
before
the

jerked
his
shoulders
and
flourished
his
castanets
threatening

the

swinging

the

made
sign
that
the

and
all
his

showed
pleasure
the

and
the

now
that

had
spoken
the
gentleman

addressed
him
with
the
cordiality
old
friend
dear
fellow
how
are
you
said
through
the
singing
making
his
horse
keep
pace
with
the
company
how
dolokhov
answered
coldly
you
see
the
lively
song
gave
special
flavor
the
tone
free
and
easy
gaiety
with
which
zherkov
spoke
and
the
intentional
coldness
dolokhov
reply
and
how
you
get
with

zherkov
all
right
they
are
good
fellows

how

the

courage
and
cheerfulness

probably
have
been

for
the
effect
that
song

that
austrians
have
been
beaten
asked
dolokhov
the
devil
only

glad
answered
dolokhov
briefly
and
clearly
the
song
demanded

come

zherkov
why

chapter
iii
returning
from
the
review
kutuzov
took
the
austrian
general
into
his
private
room
and
calling
his
adjutant
asked
for
some
papers
relating
the
condition
the
troops
their
arrival
and
the
letters
that
had
come
from
the
archduke
ferdinand
who
was
command
the
advanced
army
prince
andrew
bolkonski
came
into
the
room
with
the
required
papers
kutuzov
and
the
austrian
member
the
hofkriegsrath
were
sitting
the
table
which
plan
was
spread
out
said
kutuzov
glancing
bolkonski
this
exclamation
was
asking
the
adjutant
wait
and
went
with
the
conversation
french
all
can
say
general
said
with
pleasant
elegance
expression
and
intonation
that
obliged
one
listen
each
deliberately
spoken
word
was
evident
that
kutuzov
himself
listened
with
pleasure
his
own
voice
all
can
say
general
that
the
matter
depended
personal
wishes
the
will
his
majesty
the
emperor
francis
would
have
been
fulfilled
long
ago
should
long
ago
have
joined
the
archduke
and
believe
honour
that
personally
would
pleasure
hand
over
the
supreme
command
the
army
into
the
hands
better
informed
and
more
skillful
general
whom
austria
has
many
and
lay
down
all
this
heavy
responsibility
but
circumstances
are
sometimes
too
strong
for
general
and
kutuzov
smiled
way
that
seemed
say
you
are
quite
liberty
not
believe
and
don
even
care
whether
you
not
but
you
have
grounds
for
telling
and
that
the
whole
point
the
austrian
general
looked
dissatisfied
but
had
option
but
reply
the
same
tone
the
contrary
said
querulous
and
angry
tone
that
contrasted
with
his
flattering
words
the
contrary
your
excellency
participation
the
common
action
highly
valued
his
majesty
but
think
the
present
delay
depriving
the
splendid
russian
troops
and
their
commander
the
laurels
they
have
been
accustomed
win
their
battles
concluded
his
evidently
prearranged
sentence
kutuzov
bowed
with
the
same
smile
but
that
conviction
and
judging
the
last
letter
with
which
his
highness
the
archduke
ferdinand
has
honored
imagine
that
the
austrian
troops
under
the
direction
skillful
leader
general
mack
have
now
already
gained
decisive
victory
and
longer
need
our
aid
said
kutuzov
the
general
frowned
though
there
was
definite
news
austrian
defeat
there
were
many
circumstances
confirming
the
unfavorable
rumors
that
were
afloat
and
kutuzov
suggestion
austrian
victory
sounded
much
like
irony
but
kutuzov
went
blandly
smiling
with
the
same
expression
which
seemed
say
that
had
right
suppose
and
fact
the
last
letter
had
received
from
mack
army
informed
him
victory
and
stated
strategically
the
position
the
army
was
very
favorable
give
that
letter
said
kutuzov
turning
prince
andrew
please
have
look
and
kutuzov
with
ironical
smile
about
the
corners
his
mouth
read
the
austrian
general
the
following
passage
german
from
the
archduke
ferdinand
letter
have
fully
concentrated
forces
nearly
seventy
thousand
men
with
which
attack
and
defeat
the
enemy
should
cross
the
lech
also
are
masters
ulm
cannot
deprived
the
advantage
commanding
both
sides
the
danube
that
should
the
enemy
not
cross
the
lech
can
cross
the
danube
throw
ourselves
his
line
communications
recross
the
river
lower
down
and
frustrate
his
intention
should
try
direct
his
whole
force
against
our
faithful
ally
shall
therefore
confidently
await
the
moment
when
the
imperial
russian
army
will
fully
equipped
and
shall
then
conjunction
with
easily
find
way
prepare
for
the
enemy
the
fate
deserves
kutuzov
sighed
deeply
finishing
this
paragraph
and
looked
the
member
the
hofkriegsrath
mildly
and
attentively
but
you
know
the
wise
maxim
your
excellency
advising
one
expect
the
worst
said
the
austrian
general
evidently
wishing
have
done
with
jests
and
come
business
involuntarily
looked
round
the
aide
camp
excuse
general
interrupted
kutuzov
also
turning
prince
andrew
look
here
dear
fellow
get
from
kozlovski
all
the
reports
from
our
scouts
here
are
two
letters
from
count
nostitz
and
here
one
from
his
highness
the
archduke
ferdinand
and
here
are
these
said
handing
him
several
papers
make
neat
memorandum
french
out
all
this
showing
all
the
news
have
had
the
movements
the
austrian
army
and
then
give
his
excellency
prince
andrew
bowed
his
head
token
having
understood
from
the
first
not
only
what
had
been
said
but
also
what
kutuzov
would
have
liked
tell
him
gathered
the
papers
and
with
bow
both
stepped
softly
over
the
carpet
and
went
out
into
the
waiting
room
though
not
much
time
had
passed
since
prince
andrew
had
left
russia
had
changed
greatly
during
that
period
the
expression
his
face
his
movements
his
walk
scarcely
trace
was
left
his
former
affected
languor
and
indolence
now
looked
like
man
who
has
time
think
the
impression
makes
others
but
occupied
with
agreeable
and
interesting
work
his
face
expressed
more
satisfaction
with
himself
and
those
around
him
his
smile
and
glance
were
brighter
and
more
attractive
kutuzov
whom
had
overtaken
poland
had
received
him
very
kindly
promised
not
forget
him
distinguished
him
above
the
other
adjutants
and
had
taken
him
vienna
and
given
him
the
more
serious
commissions
from
vienna
kutuzov
wrote
his
old
comrade
prince
andrew
father
your
son
bids
fair
become
officer
distinguished
his
industry
firmness
and
expedition
consider
myself
fortunate
have
such
subordinate
kutuzov
staff
among
his
fellow
officers
and
the
army
generally
prince
andrew
had
had
had
petersburg
society
two
quite
opposite
reputations
some
minority
acknowledged
him
different
from
themselves
and
from
everyone
else
expected
great
things
him
listened
him
admired
and
imitated
him
and
with
them
prince
andrew
was
natural
and
pleasant
others
the
majority
disliked
him
and
considered
him
conceited
cold
and
disagreeable
but
among
these
people
prince
andrew
knew
how
take
his
stand
that
they
respected
and
even
feared
him
coming
out
kutuzov
room
into
the
waiting
room
with
the
papers
his
hand
prince
andrew
came
his
comrade
the
aide
camp
duty
kozlovski
who
was
sitting
the
window
with
book
well
prince
asked
kozlovski
ordered
write
memorandum
explaining
why
are
not
advancing
and
why
prince
andrew
shrugged
his
shoulders
any
news
from
mack
were
true
that
has
been
beaten
news
would
have
come
probably
said
prince
andrew
moving
toward
the
outer
door
but
that
instant
tall
austrian
general
greatcoat
with
the
order
maria
theresa
his
neck
and
black
bandage
round
his
head
who
had
evidently
just
arrived
entered
quickly
slamming
the
door
prince
andrew
stopped
short
commander
chief
kutuzov
said
the
newly
arrived
general
speaking
quickly
with
harsh
german
accent
looking
both
sides
and
advancing
straight
toward
the
inner
door
the
commander
chief
engaged
said
kozlovski
going
hurriedly
the
unknown
general
and
blocking
his
way
the
door
whom
shall
announce
the
unknown
general
looked
disdainfully
down
kozlovski
who
was
rather
short
surprised
that
anyone
should
not
know
him
the
commander
chief
engaged
repeated
kozlovski
calmly
the
general
face
clouded
his
lips
quivered
and
trembled
took
out
notebook
hurriedly
scribbled
something
pencil
tore
out
the
leaf
gave
kozlovski
stepped
quickly
the
window
and
threw
himself
into
chair
gazing
those
the
room
asking
why
they
look
then
lifted
his
head
stretched
his
neck
intended
say
something
but
immediately
with
affected
indifference
began
hum
himself
producing
queer
sound
which
immediately
broke
off
the
door
the
private
room
opened
and
kutuzov
appeared
the
doorway
the
general
with
the
bandaged
head
bent
forward
though
running
away
from
some
danger
and
making
long
quick
strides
with
his
thin
legs
went
kutuzov
vous
voyez
malheureux
mack
uttered
broken
voice
kutuzov
face
stood
the
open
doorway
remained
perfectly
immobile
for
few
moments
then
wrinkles
ran
over
his
face
like
wave
and
his
forehead
became
smooth
again
bowed
his
head
respectfully
closed
his
eyes
silently
let
mack
enter
his
room
before
him
and
closed
the
door
himself
behind
him
the
report
which
had
been
circulated
that
the
austrians
had
been
beaten
and
that
the
whole
army
had
surrendered
ulm
proved
correct
within
half
hour
adjutants
had
been
sent
various
directions
with
orders
which
showed
that
the
russian
troops
who
had
hitherto
been
inactive
would
also
soon
have
meet
the
enemy
prince
andrew
was
one
those
rare
staff
officers
whose
chief
interest
lay
the
general
progress
the
war
when
saw
mack
and
heard
the
details
his
disaster
understood
that
half
the
campaign
was
lost
understood
all
the
difficulties
the
russian
army
position
and
vividly
imagined
what
awaited
and
the
part
would
have
play
involuntarily
felt
joyful
agitation
the
thought
the
humiliation
arrogant
austria
and
that
week
time
might
perhaps
see
and
take
part
the
first
russian
encounter
with
the
french
since
suvorov
met
them
feared
that
bonaparte
genius
might
outweigh
all
the
courage
the
russian
troops
and
the
same
time
could
not
admit
the
idea
his
hero
being
disgraced
excited
and
irritated
these
thoughts
prince
andrew
went
toward
his
room
write
his
father
whom
wrote
every
day
the
corridor
met
nesvitski
with
whom
shared
room
and
the
wag
zherkov
they
were
usual
laughing
why
are
you
glum
asked
nesvitski
noticing
prince
andrew
pale
face
and
glittering
eyes
there
nothing
gay
about
answered
bolkonski
just
prince
andrew
met
nesvitski
and
zherkov
there
came
toward
them
from
the
other
end
the
corridor
strauch
austrian
general
who
kutuzov
staff
charge
the
provisioning
the
russian
army
and
the
member
the
hofkriegsrath
who
had
arrived
the
previous
evening
there
was
room
enough
the
wide
corridor
for
the
generals
pass
the
three
officers
quite
easily
but
zherkov
pushing
nesvitski
aside
with
his
arm
said
breathless
voice
they
coming
they
coming
stand
aside
make
way
please
make
way
the
generals
were
passing
looking
they
wished
avoid
embarrassing
attentions
the
face
the
wag
zherkov
there
suddenly
appeared
stupid
smile
glee
which
seemed
unable
suppress
your
excellency
said
german
stepping
forward
and
addressing
the
austrian
general
have
the
honor
congratulate
you
bowed
his
head
and
scraped
first
with
one
foot
and
then
with
the
other
awkwardly
like
child
dancing
lesson
the
member
the
hofkriegsrath
looked
him
severely
but
seeing
the
seriousness
his
stupid
smile
could
not
but
give
him
moment
attention
screwed
his
eyes
showing
that
was
listening
have
the
honor
congratulate
you
general
mack
has
arrived
quite
well
only
little
bruised
just
here
added
pointing
with
beaming
smile
his
head
the
general
frowned
turned
away
and
went
gott
wie
naiv
said
angrily
after
had
gone
few
steps
good
god
what
simplicity
nesvitski
with
laugh
threw
his
arms
round
prince
andrew
but
bolkonski
turning
still
paler
pushed
him
away
with
angry
look
and
turned
zherkov
the
nervous
irritation
aroused
the
appearance
mack
the
news
his
defeat
and
the
thought
what
lay
before
the
russian
army
found
vent
anger
zherkov
untimely
jest
you
sir
choose
make
buffoon
yourself
said
sharply
with
slight
trembling
the
lower
jaw
can
prevent
your
doing
but
warn
you
that
you
dare
play
the
fool
presence
will
teach
you
behave
yourself
nesvitski
and
zherkov
were
surprised
this
outburst
that
they
gazed
bolkonski
silently
with
wide
open
eyes
what
the
matter
only
congratulated
them
said
zherkov
not
jesting
with
you
please
silent
cried
bolkonski
and
taking
nesvitski
arm
left
zherkov
who
did
not
know
what
say
come
what
the
matter
old
fellow
said
nesvitski
trying
soothe
him
what
the
matter
exclaimed
prince
andrew
standing
still
his
excitement
don
you
understand
that
either
are
officers
serving
our
tsar
and
our
country
rejoicing
the
successes
and
grieving
the

are
merely

added
russian
but
pronouncing
the
word
with

having
noticed
that
zherkov
could
still
hear
him
forty
thousand
men
massacred

the

had
any

and
sat
down

nearest
table
both

silent
there
were
two
germans
and
russian
officer
the
room
one
spoke
and
the
only
sounds
heard
were
the
clatter
knives
and
the
munching
the
lieutenant
when
telyanin
had
finished
his
lunch
took
out
his
pocket
double
purse
and
drawing
its
rings
aside
with
his
small
white
turned
fingers
drew
out
gold
imperial
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
gave
the
waiter

rostov
rose
and
went

inaudible
voice
with
shifting
eyes
but
eyebrows
still
raised
telyanin
handed
him
the
purse

purse

said
growing
suddenly
pale
and
added

hand
examined

the
money
and
looked

looking
about

now
then
let
have
stretched
out
his
hand

purse
rostov
let
telyanin
took
the
purse
and
began
carelessly
slipping
into
the
pocket

riding
breeches
with
his
eyebrows
lifted
and
his
mouth
slightly
open
say
yes
yes
putting
purse
pocket
and
that
quite
simple
and
one
else
business
well
young
man
said
with
sigh
and
from
under
his
lifted
brows
glanced
into
rostov
eyes
some
flash
electric
spark
shot
from
telyanin
eyes
rostov
and
back
and
back
again
and
again
instant
come
here
said
rostov
catching
hold
telyanin
arm
and
almost
dragging
him
the
window
that
money
denisov
you
took
whispered
just
above
telyanin
ear
what
what
how
dare
you
what
said
telyanin
but
these
words
came
like
piteous
despairing
cry
and
entreaty
for
pardon
soon
rostov
heard
them
enormous
load
doubt
fell
from
him
was
glad
and
the
same
instant
began
pity
the
miserable
man
who
stood
before
him
but
the
task
had
begun
had
completed
heaven
only
knows
what
the
people
here
may
imagine
muttered
telyanin
taking
his
cap
and
moving
toward
small
empty
room
must
have
explanation
know
and
shall
prove
said
rostov
every
muscle
telyanin
pale
terrified
face
began
quiver
his
eyes
still
shifted
from
side
side
but
with
downward
look
not
rising
rostov
face
and
his
sobs
were
audible
count
don
ruin
young
fellow
here
this
wretched
money
take
threw
the
table
have
old
father
and
mother
rostov
took
the
money
avoiding
telyanin
eyes
and
went
out
the
room
without
word
but
the
door
stopped
and
then
retraced
his
steps
god
said
with
tears
his
eyes
how
could
you
count
said
telyanin
drawing
nearer
him
don
touch
said
rostov
drawing
back
you
need
take
the
money
and
threw
the
purse
him
and
ran
out
the
inn
chapter
that
same
evening
there
was
animated
discussion
among
the
squadron
officers
denisov
quarters
and
tell
you
rostov
that
you
must
apologize
the
colonel
said
tall
grizzly
haired
staff
captain
with
enormous
mustaches
and
many
wrinkles
his
large
features
rostov
who
was
crimson
with
excitement
the
staff
captain
kirsten
had
twice
been
reduced
the
ranks
for
affairs
honor
and
had
twice
regained
his
commission
will
allow
one
call
liar
cried
rostov
told
lied
and
told
him
lied
and
there
rests
may
keep
duty
every
day
may
place
under
arrest
but
one
can
make
apologize
because
commander
this
regiment
thinks
beneath
his
dignity
give
satisfaction
then
you
just
wait
moment
dear
fellow
and

interrupted
the
staff
captain
his
deep
bass
calmly
stroking
his
long
mustache
you
tell
the
colonel
the
presence
other
officers
that
officer
has
stolen
not
blame
that
the
conversation
began
the
presence
other
officers
perhaps
ought
not
have
spoken
before
them
but
not
diplomatist
that
why
joined
the
hussars
thinking
that
here
one
would
not
need
finesse
and
tells
that
lying
let
him
give
satisfaction
that
all
right
one
thinks
you
coward
but
that
not
the
point
ask
denisov
whether
not
out
the
question
for
cadet
demand
satisfaction
his
regimental
commander
denisov
sat
gloomily
biting
his
mustache
and
listening
the
conversation
evidently
with
wish
take
part
answered
the
staff
captain
question
disapproving
shake
his
head

the

occasionally
looked

his
glittering
black
eyes
rostov

value
your
own
pride
and

the

alighted
from

was
jammed
against

prince
nesvitski
tried

pushed
him
back

the

convoy
soldier
with

looking
down
over
the
rails
prince
nesvitski
saw
the
rapid
noisy
little
waves
the
enns
which
rippling
and
eddying
round
the
piles
the
bridge
chased
each

along

after
him
came
another
sitting
cart
where
the

said
orderly
running
behind
the
cart
and
fumbling
the
back
and
also
passed
with
the

then

from

the

was
not

visible
from
the

for
the

from

formed
the

only

though
they
tried

only
what

there
the

constantly
looking
the

the

had
cleared
again
since

was
descending

upon

around
was

the

calls
and
the

could
heard
from

empty

some
seven
hundred

was
all
that
separated
them
the
enemy
ceased
firing
and
that
stern
threatening
inaccessible
and
intangible
line
which
separates
two
hostile
armies
was
all
the
more
clearly
felt
one
step
beyond
that

which
resembles
the

one
wants
know
you
fear
and
yet
long
cross
that
line
and
know
that
sooner
later
must
crossed
and
you
will
have
find
out
what
there
just
you
will
inevitably
have
learn
what
lies
the
other
side
death

you
are

are
surrounded

and
his
whole
short
sturdy
figure
with
the
sinewy
hairy
hand
and
stumpy
fingers
which
held
the
hilt
his
naked
saber
looked
just
usually
did
especially
toward
evening
when
had
emptied
his
second
bottle
was
only
redder
than
usual
with
his
shaggy
head
thrown
back
like
birds
when
they
drink
pressing
his
spurs
mercilessly
into
the
sides
his
good
horse
bedouin
and
sitting
though
falling
backwards
the
saddle
galloped
the
other
flank
the
squadron
and
shouted
hoarse
voice
the
men
look
their
pistols
rode
kirsten
the
staff
captain
his
broad
backed
steady
mare
came
walk
meet
him
his
face
with
its
long
mustache
was
serious
always
only
his
eyes
were
brighter
than
usual
well
what
about
said
denisov
won
come
fight
you
see
shall
retire
the
devil
only
knows
what
they
about
muttered
denisov
wostov
cried
noticing
the
cadet
bright
face
you
got
last
and
smiled
approvingly
evidently
pleased
with
the
cadet
rostov
felt
perfectly
happy
just
then
the
commander
appeared
the
bridge
denisov
galloped
him
your
excellency
let
attack
them
dwive
them
off
attack
indeed
said
the
colonel
bored
voice
puckering
his
face
driving
off
troublesome
fly
and
why
are
you
stopping
here
don
you
see
the
skirmishers
are
retreating
lead
the
squadron
back
the
squadron
crossed
the
bridge
and
drew
out
range
fire
without
having
lost
single
man
the
second
squadron
that
had
been
the
front
line
followed
them
across
and
the
last
cossacks
quitted
the
farther
side
the
river
the
two
pavlograd
squadrons
having
crossed
the
bridge
retired
the
hill
one
after
the
other
their
colonel
karl
bogdanich
schubert
came
denisov
squadron
and
rode
footpace
not
far
from
rostov
without
taking
any
notice
him
although
they
were
now
meeting
for
the
first
time
since
their
encounter
concerning
telyanin
rostov
feeling
that
was
the
front
and
the
power
man
toward
whom
now
admitted
that
had
been
blame
did
not
lift
his
eyes
from
the
colonel
athletic
back
his
nape
covered
with
light
hair
and
his
red
neck
seemed
rostov
that
bogdanich
was
only
pretending
not
notice
him
and
that
his
whole
aim
now
was
test
the
cadet
courage
drew
himself
and
looked
around
him
merrily
then
seemed
him
that
bogdanich
rode
near
order
show
him
his
courage
next
thought
that
his
enemy
would
send
the
squadron
desperate
attack
just
punish
him
rostov
then
imagined
how
after
the
attack
bogdanich
would
come
him
lay
wounded
and
would
magnanimously
extend
the
hand
reconciliation
the
high
shouldered
figure
zherkov
familiar
the
pavlograds
had
but
recently
left
their
regiment
rode
the
colonel
after
his
dismissal
from
headquarters
zherkov
had
not
remained
the
regiment
saying
was
not
such
fool
slave
the
front
when
could
get
more
rewards
doing
nothing
the
staff
and
had
succeeded
attaching
himself
orderly
officer
prince
bagration
now
came
his
former
chief
with
order
from
the
commander
the
rear
guard
colonel
said
addressing
rostov
enemy
with
air
gloomy
gravity
and
glancing
round
his
comrades
there
order
stop
and
fire
the
bridge
order
who
asked
the
colonel
morosely
don
myself
know
who
replied
the
cornet
serious
tone
but
the
prince
told
and
tell
the
colonel
that
the
hussars
must
return
quickly
and
fire
the
bridge
zherkov
was
followed
officer
the
suite
who
rode
the
colonel
hussars
with
the
same
order
after
him
the
stout
nesvitski
came
galloping
cossack
horse
that
could
scarcely
carry
his
weight
how
this
colonel
shouted
approached
told
you
fire
the
bridge
and
now
someone
has
gone
and
blundered
they
are
all
beside
themselves
over
there
and
one
can
make
anything
out
the
colonel
deliberately
stopped
the
regiment
and
turned
nesvitski
you
spoke
inflammable
material
said
but
you
said
nothing
about
firing
but
dear
sir
said
nesvitski
drew
taking
off
his
cap
and
smoothing
his
hair
wet
with
perspiration
with
his
plump
hand
wasn
telling
you
fire
the
bridge
when
inflammable
material
had
been
put
position
not
your
dear
sir
staff
officer
and
you
did
not
tell
burn
the
bridge
know
the
service
and
habit
orders
strictly
obey
you
said
the
bridge
would
burned
but
who
would
burn
could
not
know
the
holy
spirit
that
always
the
way
said
nesvitski
with
wave
the
hand
how
did
you
get
here
said
turning
zherkov
the
same
business
but
you
are
damp
let
wring
you
out
you
were
saying
staff
officer
continued
the
colonel
offended
tone
colonel
interrupted
the
officer
the
suite
you
must
quick
the
enemy
will
bring
his
guns
use
grapeshot
the
colonel
looked
silently
the
officer
the
suite
the
stout
staff
officer
and
zherkov
and
frowned
will
the
bridge
fire
said
solemn
tone
announce
that
spite
all
the
unpleasantness
had
endure
would
still
the
right
thing
striking
his
horse
with
his
long
muscular
legs
were
blame
for
everything
the
colonel
moved
forward
and
ordered
the
second
squadron
that
which
rostov
was
serving
under
denisov
return
the
bridge
there
just
thought
said
rostov
himself
wishes
test
his
heart
contracted
and
the
blood
rushed
his
face
let
him
see
whether
coward
thought
again
all
the
bright
faces
the
squadron
the
serious
expression
appeared
that
they
had
worn
when
under
fire
rostov
watched
his
enemy
the
colonel
closely
find
his
face
confirmation
his
own
conjecture
but
the
colonel
did
not
once
glance
rostov
and
looked
always
did
when
the
front
solemn
and
stern
then
came
the
word
command
look
sharp
look
sharp
several
voices
repeated
around
him
their
sabers
catching
the
bridles
and
their
spurs
jingling
the
hussars
hastily
dismounted
not
knowing
what
they
were
the
men
were
crossing
themselves
rostov
longer
looked
the
colonel
had
time
was
afraid
falling
behind
the
hussars
much
afraid
that
his
heart
stood
still
his
hand
trembled
gave
his
horse
into
orderly
charge
and
felt
the
blood
rush
his
heart
with
thud
denisov
rode
past
him
leaning
back
and
shouting
something
rostov
saw
nothing
but
the
hussars
running
all
around
him
their
spurs
catching
and
their
sabers
clattering
stretchers
shouted
someone
behind
him
rostov
did
not
think
what
this
call
for
stretchers
meant
ran
trying
only
ahead
the
others
but
just
the
bridge
not
looking
the
ground
came
some
sticky
trodden
mud
stumbled
and
fell
his
hands
the
others
outstripped
him
boss
zides
captain
heard
the
voice
the
colonel
who
having
ridden
ahead
had
pulled
his
horse
near
the
bridge
with
triumphant
cheerful
face
rostov
wiping
his
muddy
hands
his
breeches
looked
his
enemy
and
was
about
run
thinking
that
the
farther
went
the
front
the
better
but
bogdanich
without
looking
recognizing
rostov
shouted
him
who
that
running
the
middle
the
bridge
the
right
come
back
cadet
cried
angrily
and
turning
denisov
who
showing
off
his
courage
had
ridden
the
planks
the
bridge
why
run
risks
captain
you
should
dismount
said
every
bullet
has
its
billet
answered
vaska
denisov
turning
his
saddle
meanwhile
nesvitski
zherkov
and
the
officer
the
suite
were
standing
together
out
range
the
shots
watching
now
the
small
group
men
with
yellow
shakos
dark
green
jackets
braided
with
cord
and
blue
riding
breeches
who
were
swarming
near
the
bridge
and
then
what
was
approaching
the
distance
from
the
opposite
side
the
blue
uniforms
and
groups
with
horses
easily
recognizable
artillery
will
they
burn
the
bridge
not
who
get
there
first
will
they
get
there
and
fire
the
bridge
will
the
french
get
within
grapeshot
range
and
wipe
them
out
these
were
the
questions
each
man
the
troops
the
high
ground
above
the
bridge
involuntarily
asked
himself
with
sinking
heart
watching
the
bridge
and
the
hussars
the
bright
evening
light
and
the
blue
tunics
advancing
from
the
other
side
with
their
bayonets
and
guns
ugh
the
hussars
will
get
hot
said
nesvitski
they
are
within
grapeshot
range
now
shouldn
have
taken
many
men
said
the
officer
the
suite
true
enough
answered
nesvitski
two
smart
fellows
could
have
done
the
job
just
well
your
excellency
put
zherkov
his
eyes
fixed
the
hussars
but
still
with
that
naive
air
that
made
impossible
know
whether
was
speaking
jest
earnest
your
excellency
how
you
look
things
send
two
men
and
who
then
would
give
the
vladimir
medal
and
ribbon
but
now
even
they
get
peppered
the
squadron
may
recommended
for
honors
and
may
get
ribbon
our
bogdanich
knows
how
things
are
done
there
now
said
the
officer
the
suite
that
grapeshot
pointed
the
french
guns
the
limbers
which
were
being
detached
and
hurriedly
removed
the
french
side
amid
the
groups
with
cannon
cloud
smoke
appeared
then
second
and
third
almost
simultaneously
and
the
moment
when
the
first
report
was
heard
fourth
was
seen
then
two
reports
one
after
another
and
third
groaned
nesvitski
fierce
pain
seizing
the
officer
the
suite
the
arm
look
man
has
fallen
fallen
fallen
two
think
were
tsar
would
never
war
said
nesvitski
turning
away
the
french
guns
were
hastily
reloaded
the
infantry
their
blue
uniforms
advanced
toward
the
bridge
run
smoke
appeared
again
but
irregular
intervals
and
grapeshot
cracked
and
rattled
onto
the
bridge
but
this
time
nesvitski
could
not
see
what
was
happening
there
dense
cloud
smoke
arose
from
the
hussars
had
succeeded
setting
fire
and
the
french
batteries
were
now
firing
them
longer
hinder
them
but
because
the
guns
were
trained
and
there
was
someone
fire
the
french
had
time
fire
three
rounds
grapeshot
before
the
hussars
got
back
their
horses
two
were
misdirected
and
the
shot
went
too
high
but
the
last
round
fell
the
midst
group
hussars
and
knocked
three
them
over
rostov
absorbed
his
relations
with
bogdanich
had
paused
the
bridge
not
knowing
what
there
was
one
hew
down
had
always
imagined
battles
himself
nor
could
help
fire
the
bridge
because
had
not
brought
any
burning
straw
with
him
like
the
other
soldiers
stood
looking
about
him
when
suddenly
heard
rattle
the
bridge
nuts
were
being
spilt
and
the
hussar
nearest
him
fell
against
the
rails
with
groan
rostov
ran
him
with
the
others
again
someone
shouted
stretchers
four
men
seized
the
hussar
and
began
lifting
him
oooh
for
christ
sake
let
alone
cried
the
wounded
man
but
still
was
lifted
and
laid
the
stretcher
nicholas
rostov
turned
away
and
searching
for
something
gazed
into
the
distance
the
waters
the
danube
the
sky
and
the
sun
how
beautiful
the
sky
looked
how
blue
how
calm
and
how
deep
how
bright
and
glorious
was
the
setting
sun
with
what
soft
glitter
the
waters
the
distant
danube
shone
and
fairer
still
were
the
faraway
blue
mountains
beyond
the
river
the
nunnery
the
mysterious
gorges
and
the
pine
forests
veiled
the
mist
their
summits
there
was
peace
and
happiness
should
wish
for
nothing
else
nothing
only
were
there
thought
rostov
myself
alone
and
that
sunshine
there
much
happiness
but
here
groans
suffering
fear
and
this
uncertainty
and
hurry
there
they
are
shouting
again
and
again
are
all
running
back
somewhere
and
shall
run
with
them
and
death
here
above
and
around
another
instant
and
shall
never
again
see
the
sun
this
water
that
gorge
that
instant
the
sun
began
hide
behind
the
clouds
and
other
stretchers
came
into
view
before
rostov
and
the
fear
death
and
the
stretchers
and
love
the
sun
and
life
all
merged
into
one
feeling
sickening
agitation
lord
god
thou
who
art
that
heaven
save
forgive
and
protect
rostov
whispered
the
hussars
ran
back
the
men
who
held
their
horses
their
voices
sounded
louder
and
calmer
the
stretchers
disappeared
from
sight
well
fwiend
you
smelt
powdah
shouted
vaska
denisov
just
above
his
ear
all
over
but
coward
yes
coward
thought
rostov
and
sighing
deeply
took
rook
his
horse
which
stood
resting
one
foot
from
the
orderly
and
began
mount
was
that
grapeshot
asked
denisov
yes
and
mistake
cried
denisov
you
worked
like
wegular
bwicks
and
nasty
work
attack
pleasant
work
hacking
away
the
dogs
but
this
sort
thing
the
very
devil
with
them
shooting
you
like
target
and
denisov
rode
group
that
had
stopped
near
rostov
composed
the
colonel
nesvitski
zherkov
and
the
officer
from
the
suite
well
seems
that
one
has
noticed
thought
rostov
and
this
was
true
one
had
taken
any
notice
for
everyone
knew
the
sensation
which
the
cadet
under
fire
for
the
first
time
had
experienced
here
something
for
you
report
said
zherkov
see
don
get
promoted
sublieutenancy
inform
the
prince
that
the
bridge
fired
said
the
colonel
triumphantly
and
gaily
and
asks
about
the
losses
trifle
said
the
colonel
his
bass
voice
two
hussars

and
one
knocked
out
added
unable
restrain
happy
smile
and
pronouncing
the
phrase

losing
confidence
its

suffering
from

compelled

under
conditions

unlike
anything
that
had
been
foreseen
the
russian
army
thirty
five
thousand
men
commanded
kutuzov
was
hurriedly
retreating
along
the
danube
stopping
where
overtaken
the

fighting
rearguard
actions
only
far
necessary
enable
retreat
without
losing
its
heavy
equipment
there
had
been

lambach
amstetten
and
melk
but
despite
the
courage
and
endurance
acknowledged
even
the
enemy
with
which
the
russians
fought

only

these
actions
was

more
rapid
retreat
austrian

that
had
escaped

and
had
joined
kutuzov
braunau
now
separated
from

and
kutuzov
was
left
with
only
his
own
weak
and
exhausted
forces
the
defense

the
plan
which
carefully

been

when

almost
unattainable
aim
remaining
for
him
was

the

for

and
two
enemy

for
the
first
time
after

retreat
the
russian
troops
had
halted
and
after
fight
had
not
only
held
the
field
but
had
repulsed
the
french

the
troops
were
ill
clad
exhausted
and
had
lost

though
the

the

the

raised
the
spirits
the

attain
long
desired
happiness
soon
closed
his
eyes
his
ears
seemed
filled
with
the
rattle
the
wheels
and
the
sensation
victory
then
began
imagine
that
the
russians
were
running
away
and
that
himself
was
killed
but
quickly
roused
himself
with
feeling
joy
learning
afresh
that
this
was
not
but
that
the
contrary
the
french
had
run
away
again
recalled
all
the
details
the
victory
and
his
own
calm
courage
during
the
battle
and
feeling
reassured
dozed
off
the
dark
starry
night
was
followed
bright
cheerful
morning
the
snow
was
thawing
the
sunshine
the
horses
galloped
quickly
and
both
sides
the
road
were
forests
different
kinds
fields
and
villages
one
the
post
stations
overtook
convoy
russian
wounded
the
russian
officer

the

lolled
back
the
front
cart
shouting
and
scolding
soldier
with
coarse
abuse
each
the
long
german
carts
six
more
pale
dirty
bandaged
men
were
being
jolted
over
the
stony
road
some
them
were
talking
heard
russian
words
others
were
eating
bread
the
more
severely
wounded
looked
silently
with
the
languid
interest
sick
children
the
envoy
hurrying
past
them
prince
andrew
told
his
driver
stop
and
asked
soldier
what
action
they
had
been
wounded
day
before
yesterday
the
danube
answered
the
soldier
prince
andrew
took
out
his
purse
and
gave
the
soldier
three
gold
pieces
that
for
them
all
said
the
officer
who
came
get
well
soon
lads
continued
turning
the
soldiers
there
plenty
still
what
news
sir
asked
the
officer
evidently
anxious
start
conversation
good
news
shouted
the
driver
and
they
galloped
was
already
quite
dark
when
prince
andrew
rattled
over
the
paved
streets
brunn
and
found
himself
surrounded
high
buildings
the
lights
shops
houses
and
street
lamps
fine
carriages
and
all
that
atmosphere
large
and
active
town
which
always
attractive
soldier
after
camp
life
despite
his
rapid
journey
and
sleepless
night
prince
andrew
when
drove
the
palace
felt
even
more
vigorous
and
alert
than
had
done
the
day
before
only
his
eyes
gleamed
feverishly
and
his
thoughts
followed
one
another
with
extraordinary
clearness
and
rapidity
again
vividly
recalled
the
details
the
battle
longer
dim
but
definite
and
the
concise
form
which
imagined
himself
stating
them
the
emperor
francis
vividly
imagined
the
casual
questions
that
might
put
him
and
the
answers
would
give
expected
once
presented
the
emperor
the
chief
entrance
the
palace
however
official
came
running
out
meet
him
and
learning
that
was
special
messenger
led
him
another
entrance
the
right
from
the
corridor
euer
hochgeboren
there
you
will
find
the
adjutant
duty
said
the
official
will
conduct
you
the
minister
war
the
adjutant
duty
meeting
prince
andrew
asked
him
wait
and
went
the
minister
war
five
minutes
later
returned
and
bowing
with
particular
courtesy
ushered
prince
andrew
before
him
along
corridor
the
cabinet
where
the
minister
war
was
work
the
adjutant
his
elaborate
courtesy
appeared
wish
ward
off
any
attempt
familiarity
the
part
the
russian
messenger
prince
andrew
joyous
feeling
was
considerably
weakened
approached
the
door
the
minister
room
felt
offended
and
without
his
noticing
the
feeling
offense
immediately
turned
into
one
disdain
which
was
quite
uncalled
for
his
fertile
mind
instantly
suggested
him
point
view
which
gave
him
right
despise
the
adjutant
and
the
minister
away
from
the
smell
powder
they
probably
think
easy
gain
victories
thought
his
eyes
narrowed
disdainfully
entered
the
room
the
minister
war
with
peculiarly
deliberate
steps
this
feeling
disdain
was
heightened
when
saw
the
minister
seated
large
table
reading
some
papers
and
making
pencil
notes
them
and
for
the
first
two
three
minutes
taking
notice
his
arrival
wax
candle
stood
each
side
the
minister
bent
bald
head
with
its
gray
temples
went
reading
the
end
without
raising
his
eyes
the
opening
the
door
and
the
sound
footsteps
take
this
and
deliver
said
his
adjutant
handing
him
the
papers
and
still
taking
notice
the
special
messenger
prince
andrew
felt
that
either
the
actions
kutuzov
army
interested
the
minister
war
less
than
any
the
other
matters
was
concerned
with
wanted
give
the
russian
special
messenger
that
impression
but
that
matter
perfect
indifference
thought
the
minister
drew
the
remaining
papers
together
arranged
them
evenly
and
then
raised
his
head
had
intellectual
and
distinctive
head
but
the
instant
turned
prince
andrew
the
firm
intelligent
expression
his
face
changed
way
evidently
deliberate
and
habitual
him
his
face
took
the
stupid
artificial
smile
which
does
not
even
attempt
hide
its
artificiality
man
who
continually
receiving
many
petitioners
one
after
another
from
general
field
marshal
kutuzov
asked
hope
good
news
there
has
been
encounter
with
mortier
victory
was
high
time
took
the
dispatch
which
was
addressed
him
and
began
read
with
mournful
expression
god
god
schmidt
exclaimed
german
what
calamity
what
calamity
having
glanced
through
the
dispatch
laid
the
table
and
looked
prince
andrew
evidently
considering
something
what
calamity
you
say
the
affair
was
decisive
but
mortier
not
captured
again
pondered
very
glad
you
have
brought
good
news
though
schmidt
death
heavy
price
pay
for
the
victory
his
majesty
will
doubt
wish
see
you
but
not
today
thank
you
you
must
have
rest
the
levee
tomorrow
after
the
parade
however
will
let
you
know
the
stupid
smile
which
had
left
his
face
while
was
speaking
reappeared
revoir
thank
you
very
much
his
majesty
will
probably
desire
see
you
added
bowing
his
head
when
prince
andrew
left
the
palace
felt
that
all
the
interest
and
happiness
the
victory
had
afforded
him
had
been
now
left
the
indifferent
hands
the
minister
war
and
the
polite
adjutant
the
whole
tenor
his
thoughts
instantaneously
changed
the
battle
seemed
the
memory
remote
event
long
past
chapter
prince
andrew
stayed

splendid
and
sitting
here
ill

after

and
dressing
prince
andrew
came
into
the
diplomat
luxurious
study
and
sat
down
the
dinner
prepared
for
him
bilibin
settled
down
comfortably
beside
the
fire
after
his
journey
and
the
campaign
during
which
had
been
deprived
all
the
comforts
cleanliness
and
all
the
refinements
life
prince
andrew
felt
pleasant
sense
repose
among
luxurious
surroundings
such
had
been
accustomed
from
childhood
besides
was
pleasant
after
his
reception
the
austrians
speak
not
russian
for
they
were
speaking
french
least
with
russian
who
would
supposed
share
the
general
russian
antipathy
the
austrians
which
was
then
particularly
strong
bilibin
was
man
thirty
five
bachelor
and
the
same
circle
prince
andrew
they
had
known
each
other
previously
petersburg
but
had
become
more
intimate
when
prince
andrew
was
vienna
with
kutuzov
just
prince
andrew
was
young
man
who
gave
promise
rising
high
the
military
profession
even
greater
extent
bilibin
gave
promise
rising
his
diplomatic
career
still
young
man
but
longer
young
diplomat
had
entered
the
service
the
age
sixteen
had
been
paris
and
copenhagen
and
now
held
rather
important
post
vienna
both
the
foreign
minister
and
our
ambassador
vienna
knew
him
and
valued
him
was
not
one
those
many
diplomats
who
are
esteemed
because
they
have
certain
negative
qualities
avoid
doing
certain
things
and
speak
french
was
one
those
who
liking
work
knew
how
and
despite
his
indolence
would
sometimes
spend
whole
night
his
writing
table
worked
well
whatever
the
import
his
work
was
not
the
question
what
for
but
the
question
how
that
interested
him
what
the
diplomatic
matter
might
did
not
care
but
gave
him
great
pleasure
prepare
circular
memorandum
report
skillfully
pointedly
and
elegantly
bilibin
services
were
valued
not
only
for
what
wrote
but
also
for
his
skill
dealing
and
conversing
with
those
the
highest
spheres
bilibin
liked
conversation
liked
work
only
when
could
made
elegantly
witty
society
always
awaited
opportunity
say
something
striking
and
took
part
conversation
only
when
that
was
possible
his
conversation
was
always
sprinkled
with
wittily
original
finished
phrases
general
interest
these
sayings
were
prepared
the
inner
laboratory
his
mind
portable
form
intentionally
that
insignificant
society
people
might
carry
them
from
drawing
room
drawing
room
and
fact
bilibin
witticisms
were
hawked
about
the
viennese
drawing
rooms
and
often
had
influence
matters
considered
important
his
thin
worn
sallow
face
was
covered
with
deep
wrinkles
which
always
looked
clean
and
well
washed
the
tips
one
fingers
after
russian
bath
the
movement
these
wrinkles
formed
the
principal
play
expression
his
face
now
his
forehead
would
pucker
into
deep
folds
and
his
eyebrows
were
lifted
then
his
eyebrows
would
descend
and
deep
wrinkles
would
crease
his
cheeks
his
small
deep
set
eyes
always
twinkled
and
looked
out
straight
well
now
tell
about
your
exploits
said
bolkonski
very
modestly
without
once
mentioning
himself
described
the
engagement
and
his
reception
the
minister

they
received
and

receives

bilibin
smiled
and
the
wrinkles
his
face
disappeared

mon

remarked
examining
his
nails
from
distance
and
puckering
the
skin
above

malgre

but
dear
fellow
with
all
respect
for
the
orthodox
russian
army
must
say
that
your
victory
was
not
particularly
victorious
went
talking
this
way
french
uttering
only
those
words
russian
which
wished
put
contemptuous
emphasis
come
now
you
with
all
your
forces
fall
the
unfortunate
mortier

and
even
then

slips
through
your

where
the

but
seriously
said
prince
andrew
can
any
rate
say
without
boasting
that
was
little
better
than
ulm
why
didn
you
capture

just
one

because
not
everything

with
the
smoothness

had
expected
told
you
get
their

the
afternoon
and
why
didn
you
seven
the
morning
you
ought
have
been
there
seven
the
morning
returned
bilibin
with
smile
you
ought
have
been
there
seven
the
morning
why
did
you
not
succeed
impressing
bonaparte
diplomatic
methods
that
had
better
leave
genoa
alone
retorted
prince
andrew
the
same
tone
know
interrupted
bilibin
you
thinking
very
easy
take

sitting

the

that
true
but
still
why
didn
you
capture

don
surprised
not
only
the

but
also
his
most
august
majesty
the

here
looked
straight
prince
andrew
and
suddenly
unwrinkled
his
forehead
now
turn
ask
you
why
mon
cher
said
bolkonski
confess
not
understand
perhaps
there
are
diplomatic
subtleties
here
beyond
feeble
intelligence
but
can
make
out
mack
loses
whole

the
archduke
ferdinand
and
the
archduke
karl
give
signs
life
and
make
blunder
after
blunder
kutuzov
alone
last
gains
real
victory
destroying
the
spell
the
invincibility
the
french
and
the

does
not
even
care
hear
the

that
just
dear
fellow
you
see
hurrah

but
this

does
nothing
the

ferdinand
disgraces

you
abandon

help
you
and
your

the
one

all
loved

and
then
you
congratulate

admit
that
more
irritating

purpose
besides
suppose
you
did
gain
brilliant

even
the

gained
victory
what
effect
would
that
have
the
general
course
events
too
late
now
when
vienna
occupied
the
french
army
what
occupied
vienna
occupied
not
only
occupied
but
bonaparte
schonbrunn
and
the
count
our
dear
count
vrbna
goes
him
for
orders
after
the
fatigues
and
impressions
the
journey
his
reception
and
especially
after
having
dined
bolkonski
felt
that
could
not
take
the
full
significance
the
words
heard
count
lichtenfels
was
here
this
morning
bilibin
continued
and
showed
letter
which
the
parade
the
french
vienna
was
fully
described
prince
murat
tout
tremblement
you
see
that
your
victory
not
matter
for
great
rejoicing
and
that
you
can
received
savior
really
don
care
about
that
don
care
all
said
prince
andrew
beginning
understand
that
his
news
the
battle
before
krems
was
really
small
importance
view
such
events
the
fall
austria
capital
how
vienna
was
taken
what
the
bridge
and
its
celebrated
bridgehead
and
prince
auersperg
heard
reports
that
prince
auersperg
was
defending
vienna
said
prince
auersperg
this
our
side
the
river
and
defending
doing
very
badly
think
but
still
defending
but
vienna
the
other
side
the
bridge
has
not
yet
been
taken
and
hope
will
not
for
mined
and
orders
have
been
given
blow
otherwise
should
long
ago
have
been
the
mountains
bohemia
and
you
and
your
army
would
have
spent
bad
quarter
hour
between
two
fires
but
still
this
does
not
mean
that
the
campaign
over
said
prince
andrew
well
think
the
bigwigs
here
think
too
but
they
daren
say
will
said
the
beginning
the
campaign
won
your
skirmishing
durrenstein
gunpowder
all
that
will
decide
the
matter
but
those
who
devised
said
bilibin
quoting
one
his
own
mots
releasing
the
wrinkles
his
forehead
and
pausing
the
only
question
what
will
come
the
meeting
between
the
emperor
alexander
and
the
king
prussia
berlin
prussia
joins
the
allies
austria
hand
will
forced
and
there
will
war
not
merely
question
settling
where
the
preliminaries
the
new
campo
formio
are
drawn
what
extraordinary
genius
prince
andrew
suddenly
exclaimed
clenching
his
small
hand
and
striking
the
table
with
and
what
luck
the
man
has
buonaparte
said
bilibin
inquiringly
puckering
his
forehead
indicate
that
was
about
say
something
witty
buonaparte
repeated
accentuating
the
think
however
now
that
lays
down
laws
for
austria
schonbrunn
faut
lui
faire
grace
shall
certainly
adopt
innovation
and
call
him
simply
bonaparte
must
let
him
off
the
but
joking
apart
said
prince
andrew
you
really
think
the
campaign
over
this
what
think
austria
has
been
made
fool
and
she
not
used
she
will
retaliate
and
she
has
been
fooled
the
first
place
because
her
provinces
have
been
pillaged
they
say
the
holy
russian
army
loots
terribly
her
army
destroyed
her
capital
taken
and
all
this
for
the
beaux
yeux
his
sardinian
majesty
and
therefore
this
between
ourselves
instinctively
feel
that
are
being
deceived
instinct
tells
negotiations
with
france
and
projects
for
peace
secret
peace
concluded
separately
fine
eyes
impossible
cried
prince
andrew
that
would
too
base
live
shall
see
replied
bilibin
his
face
again
becoming
smooth
sign
that
the
conversation
was
end
when
prince
andrew
reached
the
room
prepared
for
him
and
lay
down
clean
shirt
the
feather
bed
with
its
warmed
and
fragrant
pillows
felt
that
the
battle
which
had
brought
tidings
was
far
far
away
from
him
the
alliance
with
prussia
austria
treachery
bonaparte
new
triumph
tomorrow
levee
and
parade
and
the
audience
with
the
emperor
francis
occupied
his
thoughts
closed
his
eyes
and
immediately
sound
cannonading
musketry
and
the
rattling
carriage
wheels
seemed
fill
his
ears
and
now
again
drawn
out
thin
line
the
musketeers
were
descending
the
hill
the
french
were
firing
and
felt
his
heart
palpitating
rode
forward
beside
schmidt
with
the
bullets
merrily
whistling
all
around
and
experienced
tenfold
the
joy
living
had
not
done
since
childhood
woke
yes
that
all
happened
said
and
smiling
happily
himself
like
child
fell
into
deep
youthful
slumber
chapter
next
day
woke
late
recalling
his
recent
impressions
the
first
thought
that
came
into
his
mind
was
that
today
had
presented
the
emperor
francis
remembered
the
minister
war
the
polite
austrian
adjutant
bilibin
and
last
night
conversation
having
dressed
for
his
attendance
court
full
parade
uniform
which
had
not
worn
for
long
time
went
into
bilibin
study
fresh
animated
and
handsome
with
his
hand
bandaged
the
study
were
four
gentlemen
the
diplomatic
corps
with

bolkonski
was
already
acquainted
bilibin
introduced
him
the
others
the
gentlemen
assembled
bilibin
were
young
wealthy
gay
society
men
who
here
vienna
formed
special
set
which
bilibin
their
leader
called
les
notres
this
set
consisting
almost
exclusively
diplomats
evidently
had
its
own
interests
which
had
nothing
with
war
politics
but
related
high
society
certain
women
and
the
official
side
the
service
these
gentlemen
received
prince
andrew
one
themselves
honor
they
did
not
extend
many
from
politeness
and
start
conversation
they
asked
him
few
questions
about
the
army
and
the
battle
and
then
the
talk
went
off
into
merry
jests
and
gossip
ours
but
the
best
was
said
one
telling
the
misfortune
fellow
diplomat
that
the
chancellor
told
him
flatly
that
his
appointment
london
was
promotion
and
that
was
regard
can
you
fancy
the
figure
cut
but
the
worst
gentlemen
giving
kuragin
away
you
that
that

suffers
and
this

wicked

prince
hippolyte
was
lolling

chair
with
his

over
its

began
laugh
tell
about
that
said
you
don

you
serpent
cried
several
voices
you
bolkonski

said
bilibin
turning
prince
andrew
that
all
the
atrocities
the
french
army
nearly
said
the
russian
army
are
nothing
compared
what
this
man
has
been
doing
among
the
women
femme

announced
prince
hippolyte
and
began
looking
through
lorgnette
his
elevated
legs
woman
man
companion
bilibin
and
the
rest
ours
burst
out
laughing
hippolyte
face
and
prince
andrew
saw
that
hippolyte
whom
had
admit
had
almost
been
jealous
his
wife
account
was
the
butt
this
set
must
give
you
treat
bilibin
whispered
bolkonski
kuragin
exquisite
when
discusses
politics
you
should
see
his
gravity
sat
down
beside
hippolyte
and
wrinkling
his
forehead
began
talking
him
about
politics
prince
andrew
and
the
others
gathered
round
these
two
the
berlin
cabinet
cannot
express
feeling
alliance
began
hippolyte
gazing
round
with
importance
the
others
without
expressing
its
last
note
you
understand
besides
unless
his
majesty
the
emperor
derogates
from
the
principle
our
alliance

said
prince
andrew
seizing
him
the
arm
believe
that
intervention
will
stronger
than
nonintervention
and
paused
finally
one
cannot
impute
the
nonreceipt

said
bilibin
and
the
mop
hair
his
head
moved
with
satisfaction
everybody
laughed
and
hippolyte
louder
than
anyone
was
evidently
distressed
and
breathed
painfully
but
could
not
restrain
the
wild
laughter
that
convulsed
his
usually
impassive
features

what

excitement
there

confess
that
this
delightful
said
this
affair
the
thabor

they
have
crossed
without
striking

prince
andrew
could
not

but
where
you

not

what
every
coachman
the
town
knows
come
from
the
archduchess
heard
nothing
there
and
you
didn
see
that
everybody
packing
did
not
what
all
about
inquired
prince
andrew
impatiently
what
all
about
why
the
french
have
crossed
the
bridge
that
auersperg
was
defending
and
the
bridge
was
not
blown
murat
now
rushing
along
the
road
brunn
and
will
here
day
two
what
here
but
why
did
they
not
blow
the
bridge
was
mined
that
what
ask
you
one
not
even
bonaparte
knows
why
bolkonski
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
the
bridge
crossed
means
that
the
army
too
lost
will
cut
off
said
that
just
answered
bilibin
listen
the
french
entered
vienna
told
you
very
well
next
day
which
was
yesterday
those
gentlemen
messieurs
les
marechaux
murat
lannes
and
belliard
mount
and
ride
the
bridge
observe
that
all
three
are
gascons
gentlemen
says
one
them
you
know
the
thabor
bridge
mined
and
doubly
mined
and
that
there
are
menacing
fortifications
its
head
and
army
fifteen
thousand
men
has
been
ordered
blow
the
bridge
and
not
let
cross
but
will
please
our
sovereign
the
emperor
napoleon
take
this
bridge
let
three
and
take
yes
let
say
the
others
and
off
they
and
take
the
bridge

and
now
with
their
whole
army
are
this
side
the
danube
marching
you
and
your
lines
communication
the
marshalls
stop
jesting
said
prince
andrew
sadly
and
seriously
this
news
grieved
him
and
yet
was
pleased
soon
learned
that
the
russian
army
was
such
hopeless
situation
occurred
him
that
was
who
was
destined
lead
out
this
position
that
here
was
the
toulon
that
would
lift
him
from
the
ranks
obscure
officers
and
offer
him
the
first
step
fame
listening
bilibin
was
already
imagining
how
reaching
the
army
would
give
opinion
the
war
council
which
would
the
only
one
that
could
save
the
army
and
how
alone
would
entrusted
with
the
executing
the
plan
stop
this
jesting
said
not
jesting
bilibin
went
nothing
truer
sadder
these
gentlemen
ride
onto
the
bridge
alone
and
wave
white
handkerchiefs
they
assure
the
officer
duty
that
they
the
marshals
are
their
way
negotiate
with
prince
auersperg
lets
them
enter
the
tête
pont
they
spin
him
thousand
gasconades
saying
that
the
war
over
that
the
emperor
francis
arranging
meeting
with
bonaparte
that
they
desire
see
prince
auersperg
and
the
officer
sends
for
auersperg
these
gentlemen
embrace
the
officers
crack
jokes
sit
the
cannon
and
meanwhile
french
battalion
gets
the
bridge
unobserved
flings
the
bags
incendiary
material
into
the
water
and
approaches
the
tête
pont
length
appears
the
lieutenant
general
our
dear
prince
auersperg
von
mautern
himself
dearest
foe
flower
the
austrian

hero
the
turkish
wars
hostilities
are
ended
can
shake
one
another
hand
the
emperor
napoleon
burns
with
impatience
make
prince
auersperg
acquaintance
word
those
gentlemen
gascons
indeed
bewildered
him
with
fine
words
and
flattered
his
rapidly
established
intimacy
with
the
french
marshals
and
dazzled
the
sight
murat
mantle
and
ostrich
plumes
voit
que

celui

faire
faire
sur

spite
the
animation
his
speech
bilibin
did
not
forget
pause
after
this
mot
give
time
for
its
due
appreciation
the
french
battalion
rushes
the
bridgehead
spikes
the
guns
and
the
bridge
taken
but
what
best
all
went
his
excitement
subsiding
under
the
delightful
interest
his
own
story
that
the
sergeant
charge
the
cannon
which
was
give
the
signal
fire
the
mines
and
blow
the
bridge
this
sergeant
seeing
that
the
french
troops
were
running
onto
the
bridge
was
about
fire
but
lannes
stayed
his
hand
the
sergeant
who
was
evidently
wiser
than
his
general
goes
auersperg
and
says
prince
you
are
being
deceived
here
are
the
french
murat
seeing
that
all
lost
the
sergeant
allowed
speak
turns
auersperg
with
feigned
astonishment
true
gascon
and
says
don
recognize
the
world
famous
austrian
discipline
you
allow
subordinate
address
you
like
that
was
stroke
genius
prince
auersperg
feels
his
dignity
stake
and
orders
the
sergeant
arrested
come
you
must
own
that
this
affair
the
thabor
bridge
delightful
not
exactly
stupidity
nor
rascality
bridgehead
that
their
fire
gets
into
his
eyes
and
forgets
that
ought
firing
the
enemy
may
treachery
said
prince
andrew
vividly
imagining
the
gray
overcoats
wounds
the
smoke
gunpowder
the
sounds
firing
and
the
glory
that
awaited
him
not
that
either
that
puts
the
court
too
bad
light
replied
bilibin
not
treachery
nor
rascality
nor
stupidity
just
ulm
seemed
trying
find
the
right
expression
est

mack
nous

bit

concluded
feeling
that
had
produced
good
epigram
fresh
one
that
would
repeated
his
hitherto
puckered
brow
became
smooth
sign
pleasure
and
with
slight
smile
began
examine
his
nails
where
are
you
off
said
suddenly
prince
andrew
who
had
risen
and
was
going
toward
his
room
going
away
where
the
army
but
you
meant
stay
another
two
days
but
now
off
once
and
prince
andrew
after
giving
directions
about
his
departure
went
his
room
you
know
mon
cher
said
bilibin
following
him
have
been
thinking
about
you
why
are
you
going
and
proof
the
conclusiveness
his
opinion
all
the
wrinkles
vanished
from
his
face
prince
andrew
looked
inquiringly
him
and
gave
reply
why
are
you
going
know
you
think
your
duty
gallop
back
the
army
now
that
danger
understand
that
mon
cher
heroism
not
all
said
prince
andrew
but
you
are
philosopher
consistent
one
look
the
other
side
the
question
and
you
will
see
that
your
duty
the
contrary
take
care
yourself
leave
those
who
are
longer
fit
for
anything
else
you
have
not
been
ordered
return
and
have
not
been
dismissed
from
here
therefore
you
can
stay
and
with
wherever
our
ill
luck
takes
they
say

going
olmutz
and
olmutz
very
decent
town
you
and
will
travel
comfortably
caleche
stop
joking
bilibin
cried
bolkonski
speaking
sincerely
friend
consider
where
and
why
are
you
going
when
you
might
remain
here
you
are
faced
one
two
things
and
the
skin
over
his
left
temple
puckered
either
you
will
not
reach
your
regiment
before
peace
concluded
you
will
share
defeat
and
disgrace
with
kutuzov
whole
army
and
bilibin
unwrinkled
his
temple
feeling
that
the
dilemma
was
insoluble
cannot
argue
about
replied
prince
andrew
coldly
but
thought
going
save
the
army
dear
fellow
you
are
hero
said
bilibin
chapter
xiii
that
same
night
having
taken
leave
the
minister

bolkonski
set
off
rejoin
the
army
not
knowing
where
would
find
and
fearing
captured
the
french
the
way
krems
brunn
everybody
attached
the
court
was
packing
and
the
heavy
baggage
was
already
being
dispatched
olmutz
near
hetzelsdorf
prince
andrew
struck
the
high
road
along
which
the
russian
army
was
moving
with
great
haste
and
the
greatest
disorder
the
road
was
obstructed
with
carts
that
was
impossible
get
carriage
prince
andrew
took
horse
and
cossack
from
cossack
commander
and
hungry
and
weary
making
his
way
past
the
baggage
wagons
rode
search
the
commander
chief
and
his
own
luggage
very
sinister
reports
the
position
the
army
reached
him
went
along
and
the
appearance
the
troops
their
disorderly
flight
confirmed
these
rumors

remembered
these
words
bonaparte
address
his
army
the
beginning

and
they
awoke
him
astonishment
the
genius
his

feeling
wounded
pride
and
hope
glory
and
should
there
nothing

ends
the
earth
english

shall
cause
share
the
same
fate
the
fate
the
army
ulm
looked
with
disdain
the
endless
confused
mass
detachments
carts
guns
artillery
and
again
baggage
wagons
and
vehicles
all
kinds
overtaking
one
another
and
blocking
the
muddy
road
three
and
sometimes
four
abreast
from
all
sides
behind
and
before
far
ear
could
reach
there
were
the
rattle
wheels
the
creaking
carts
and
gun
carriages
the
tramp
horses
the
crack
whips
shouts
the
urging
horses
and
the
swearing
soldiers
orderlies
and
officers
all
along
the
sides
the
road
fallen
horses
were
seen
some
flayed
some
not
and
broken
down
carts
beside
which
solitary
soldiers
sat
waiting
for
something
and
again
soldiers
straggling
from
their
companies
crowds
whom
set
off
the
neighboring
villages
returned
from
them
dragging
sheep
fowls
hay
and
bulging
sacks
each
ascent
descent
the
road
the
crowds
were
yet
denser
and
the
din
shouting
more
incessant
soldiers
floundering
knee
deep
mud
pushed
the
guns
and
wagons
themselves
whips
cracked
hoofs
slipped
traces
broke
and
lungs
were
strained
with
shouting
the
officers
directing
the
march
rode
backward
and
forward
between
the
carts
their
voices
were
but
feebly
heard
amid
the
uproar
and
one
saw
their
faces
that
they
despaired
the
possibility
checking
this
disorder
here
our
dear
orthodox
russian
army
thought
bolkonski
recalling
bilibin
words
wishing
find
out
where
the
commander
chief
was
rode
convoy
directly
opposite
him
came
strange
one
horse
vehicle
evidently
rigged
soldiers
out
any
available
materials
and
looking
like
something
between
cart
cabriolet
and

under

the

prince
andrew
rode
and
was
just
putting
his
question
soldier
when
his
attention
was
diverted
the
desperate
shrieks
the

the

officer
charge

was
beating
the

who
was
driving

for
trying

others
and
the

his

fell
the

the

the
woman
screamed
piercingly
seeing
prince
andrew
she
leaned
out
from
behind
the
apron
and
waving
her
thin
arms
from
under
the
woolen
shawl
cried
aide
camp
aide

for
heaven
sake

what

become

the
angry

the

turn

with
your

aide

what

screamed
the

kindly

said
prince
andrew
riding
the

the
officer
glanced
him
and
without
replying
turned
again
the
soldier
teach
you
push
back
let
them

repeated
prince
andrew
compressing
his
lips
and
who

cried
the

turning
him
with
tipsy
rage
who
are
you

repeated
this
expression
evidently
pleased
him
that
was
nice
snub
for
the
little
aide
camp
came
voice
from
behind
prince
andrew
saw
that
the
officer
was
that
state
senseless
tipsy
rage
when
man
does
not
know
what
saying
saw
that
his
championship
the
doctor
wife
her
queer
trap
might
expose
him
what
dreaded
more
than
anything
the
world
ridicule
but
his
instinct
urged
him
before
the
officer
finished
his
sentence
prince
andrew
his
face
distorted
with
fury
rode
him
and
raised
his
riding
whip
kind
let
them
pass
the
officer
flourished
his
arm
and
hastily
rode
away
all
the
fault
these
fellows
the
staff
that
there
this
disorder
muttered
you
like
prince
andrew
without
lifting
his
eyes
rode
hastily
away
from
the
doctor
wife
who
was
calling
him
her
deliverer
and
recalling
with
sense
disgust
the
minutest
details
this
humiliating
scene
galloped
the
village
where
was
told
that
the
commander
chief
was
reaching
the
village
dismounted
and
went
the
nearest
house
intending
rest
but
for
moment
eat
something
and
try
sort
out
the
stinging
and
tormenting
thoughts
that
confused
his
mind
this
mob
scoundrels
and
not
army
was
thinking
went
the
window
the
first
house
when
familiar
voice
called
him
name
turned
round
nesvitski
handsome
face
looked
out
the
little
window
nesvitski
moving
his
moist
lips
chewed
something
and
flourishing
his

called
him

bolkonski

shouted
entering
the

saw
nesvitski
and
another

having
something

they
hastily
turned
round
him
asking
had
any
news
their
familiar
faces
read
agitation
and
alarm
this
was
particularly
noticeable
nesvitski
usually
laughing
countenance
where
the
commander
chief
asked
bolkonski

that
house
answered
the
adjutant
well

that

with
bad

old

but
what
the

must
ill

added
noticing
that
prince
andrew
winced
electric
shock
nothing
replied
prince
andrew
had
just
remembered
his
recent
encounter
with
the
doctor
wife
and
the
convoy
officer
what
the
commander
chief
doing
here
asked
can
make
out
all
said
nesvitski
well
all
can
make
out
that
everything
abominable
abominable
quite
abominable
said
prince
andrew
and
went
off
the
house
where
the
commander
chief
was
passing
kutuzov
carriage
and
the
exhausted
saddle
horses
his
suite
with
their
cossacks
who
were
talking
loudly
together
prince
andrew
entered

said
the

glancing
angrily
and
disrespectfully
kozlovski
through
the
door
came
the
sounds
kutuzov
voice
excited
and
dissatisfied
interrupted
another
unfamiliar
voice
from
the
sound
these
voices
the
inattentive
way
kozlovski
looked
him
the
disrespectful
manner
the
exhausted
clerk
the
fact
that
the
clerk
and
kozlovski
were
squatting
the
floor
tub
near
the
commander
chief
and
from
the
noisy
laughter
the
cossacks
holding
the
horses
near
the
window
prince
andrew
felt
that
something
important
and
disastrous
was
about
happen
turned
kozlovski
with
urgent
questions
immediately
prince
said
kozlovski
dispositions
for
bagration
what
about
capitulation
nothing
the
sort
orders

issued
for

prince
andrew
moved
toward
the
door
from
whence
voices
were
heard
just
was
going
open
the
sounds
ceased
the
door
opened
and
kutuzov
with
his
eagle
nose
and
puffy
face
appeared
the
doorway
prince
andrew
stood
right
front
kutuzov
but
the
expression
the
commander
chief
one
sound
eye
showed
him
preoccupied
with
thoughts
and
anxieties
oblivious
his
presence
looked
straight
his
adjutant
face
without
recognizing
him
well
have
you
finished
said
kozlovski
one
moment
your
excellency
bagration
gaunt
middle
aged
man
medium
height
with
firm
impassive
face
oriental
type
came
out
after

repeated
prince
andrew
rather
loudly
handing
kutuzov
envelope
from
vienna
very
good
later
later
kutuzov
went
out
into
the
porch
with
bagration
well
good
prince
said
bagration
blessing
and
may
christ
with
you
your
great
endeavor
his
face
suddenly
softened
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
with
his
left
hand
drew
bagration
toward
him
and
with
his
right
which
wore
ring
made
the
sign
the
cross
over
him
with
gesture
evidently
habitual
offering
his
puffy
cheek
but
bagration
kissed
him
the
neck
instead

kutuzov
repeated
and
went
toward
his
carriage
get
with
said
bolkonski
your
excellency
should
like
use

said
kutuzov
and
noticing
that
bolkonski
still
delayed
added
need
good
officers
myself
need
them
myself
they
got
into
the
carriage
and
drove
for
few
minutes
silence
there
still
much
much
before
said
with
old

penetration
understood
all
that
was
passing
bolkonski

added
speaking
himself
prince
andrew
glanced
kutuzov
face
only
foot
distant
from
him
and
involuntarily
noticed
the
carefully
washed
seams
the
scar
near
his
temple
where
ismail
bullet
had
pierced
his
skull
and
the
empty
eye
socket
yes

speak
calmly
those

death
thought
bolkonski
that
why
beg
sent
that
detachment
said
kutuzov
did
not
reply
seemed
have
forgotten
what
had
been
saying
and
sat
plunged
thought
five
minutes
later
gently
swaying
the
soft
springs
the
carriage
turned
prince
andrew
there
was
not
trace
agitation
his
face
with
delicate
irony
questioned
prince
andrew
about
the
details
his
interview
with
the
emperor
about
the
remarks
had
heard
court
concerning
the
krems
affair
and
about
some
ladies
they
both
knew
chapter
xiv
november
kutuzov
had
received
through
spy
news
that
the
army
commanded
was
almost
hopeless
position
the
spy
reported
that
the
french
after
crossing
the
bridge
vienna
were
advancing
immense
force
upon
kutuzov
line
communication
with
the
troops
that
were
arriving
from
russia
kutuzov
decided
remain
krems
napoleon
army
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
would
cut
him
off
completely
and
surround
his
exhausted
army
forty
thousand
and
would
find
himself
the
position
mack
ulm
kutuzov
decided
abandon
the
road
connecting
him
with
the
troops
arriving
from
russia
would
have
march
with
road
into
unknown
parts
the
bohemian
mountains
defending
himself
against
superior
forces
the
enemy
and
abandoning
all
hope
junction
with
buxhowden
kutuzov
decided
retreat
along
the
road
from
krems
olmutz
unite
with
the
troops
arriving
from
russia
risked
being
forestalled
that
road
the
french
who
had
crossed
the
vienna
bridge
and
encumbered
his
baggage
and
transport
having
accept
battle
the
march
against
enemy
three
times
strong
who
would
hem
him
from
two
sides
kutuzov
chose
this
latter
course
the
french
the
spy
reported
having
crossed
the
vienna
bridge
were
advancing
forced
marches
toward
znaim
which
lay
sixty
six
miles
off
the
line
kutuzov
retreat
reached
znaim
before
the
french
there
would
great
hope
saving
the
army
let
the
french
forestall
him
znaim
meant
the
exposure
his
whole
army
disgrace
such
that
ulm
utter
destruction
but
forestall
the
french
with
his
whole
army
was
impossible
the
road
for
the
french
from
vienna
znaim
was
shorter
and
better
than
the
road
for
the
russians
from
krems
znaim
the
night
received
the
news
kutuzov
sent
bagration
vanguard
four
thousand
strong
the
right
across
the
hills
from
the
krems
znaim
the
vienna
znaim
road
bagration
was
make
this
march
without
resting
and
halt
facing
vienna
with
znaim
his
rear
and
succeeded
forestalling
the
french
was
delay
them
long
possible
kutuzov
himself
with
all
his
transport
took
the
road
znaim
marching
thirty
miles
that
stormy
night
across
roadless
hills
with
his
hungry
ill
shod
soldiers
and
losing
third
his
men
stragglers
the
way
bagration
came
out
the
vienna
znaim
road
hollabrunn
few
hours
ahead
the
french
who
were
approaching
hollabrunn
from
vienna
kutuzov
with
his
transport
had
still
march
for
some
days
before
could
reach
znaim
hence
bagration
with
his
four
thousand
hungry
exhausted
men
would
have
detain
for
days
the
whole
enemy
army
that
came
upon
him
hollabrunn
which
was
clearly
impossible
but
freak
fate
made
the
impossible
possible

replied
that

not

refuse

and
sent
his
adjutant
kutuzov

the

kutuzov
sole
chance
gaining
time
giving

exhausted

some
rest
and
letting

said
captain
tushin
smiling
shyly
his
uncomfortable

wishing

jocular

but
before

that
his

was
unacceptable
and

was
something
peculiar
about
quite
unsoldierly
rather
comic
but
extremely
attractive
the

and
prince
andrew
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
having
ridden
beyond
the

continually
meeting
and
overtaking
soldiers

various

they
saw

and
went
again
just
behind
they
came
upon
some
dozens

continually
replaced

who
ran
from

they
had

put

the

stopped
and
began
examining
the

that
our

further
the

remained
behind
and
prince
andrew
rode
alone
the
farther
forward
and
nearer
the
enemy
went
the
more
orderly
and
cheerful
were
the
troops
the
greatest
disorder
and
depression
had
been
the

passed
that
morning

seven
miles
away
from

also
some
apprehension
and
alarm
could
felt
but
the
nearer

the
more
confident
was
the
appearance
our

the

were

officers
were
counting
the

and
telling

soldiers
scattered
over
the

were
dragging
logs
and
brushwood
and
were
building
shelters
with
merry
chatter
and
laughter
around
the
fires
sat
others
dressed
and
undressed
drying
their

and

mending

and
crowding
round
the

one

the

lifted
the

lids
their

with
reverential

emptied
them
rolling

with
brightened
expressions
licking
their
lips
and
wiping
them
the
sleeves
their
greatcoats
all
their

were
serene
all

were
happening

not

said
the

rode
along
our

and
that
the

but
the

where
the

with

had
passed
that
morning
the
lines
were
near
together
that
the

could
see
one
another
faces
and
speak
one
another
besides
the
soldiers
who
formed
the
picket
line
either
side
there
were
many
curious
onlookers
who
jesting
and
laughing
stared
their
strange
foreign
enemies
since
early
morning
despite
injunction
not
approach
the
picket
line
the
officers
had
been
unable
keep

him
and
stopped

what
was

come
from
the
left
flank
where
their
regiment
was
stationed
with
his
captain

and
trying

the
speech
which
was
incomprehensible
him
more

what
saying
dolokhov
did
not
answer
the
captain
had
been
drawn
into
hot
dispute
with
the
french
grenadier
they
were
naturally
talking
about
the
campaign
the
frenchman
confusing
the
austrians
with
the
russians
was
trying
prove
that
the
russians
had
surrendered
and
had
fled
all
the
way
from

while
dolokhov
maintained
that
the
russians
had
not
surrendered

ouh

came
peals
such
healthy
and
good
humored
laughter
from
the
soldiers
that
infected
the
french
involuntarily
much
that
the
only
thing
left
seemed
unload
the
muskets
explode
the
ammunition
and
all
return
home
quickly
possible
but
the
guns
remained
loaded
the
loopholes
blockhouses
and
entrenchments
looked
out
just
menacingly
and
the
unlimbered
cannon
confronted
one
another
before
chapter
xvi
having
ridden
round
the
whole
line
from
right
flank
left
prince
andrew
made
his
way
the
battery
from
which
the
staff
officer
had
told
him
the
whole
field
could
seen
here
dismounted
and
stopped
beside
the
farthest
the
four
unlimbered
cannon
before
the
guns
artillery
sentry
was
pacing
and
down
stood
attention
when
the
officer
arrived
but
sign
resumed
his
measured
monotonous
pacing
behind
the
guns
were
their
limbers
and
still
farther
back
picket
ropes
and
artillerymen
bonfires
the
left
not
far
from
the
farthest
cannon
was
small
newly
constructed
wattle
shed
from
which
came
the
sound
officers
voices
eager
conversation
was
true
that
view
over
nearly
the
whole
russian
position
and
the
greater
part
the
enemy
opened
out
from
this
battery
just
facing
the
crest
the
opposite
hill
the
village
schon
grabern
could
seen
and
three
places
left
and
right
the
french
troops
amid
the
smoke
their
campfires
the
greater
part
whom
were
evidently
the
village
itself
and
behind
the
hill
the
left
from
that
village
amid
the
smoke
was
something
resembling
battery
but
was
impossible
see
clearly
with
the
naked
eye
our
right
flank
was
posted
rather
steep
incline
which
dominated
the
french
position
our
infantry
were
stationed
there
and
the
farthest
point
the
dragoons
the
center
where
tushin
battery
stood
and
from
which
prince
andrew
was
surveying
the
position
was
the
easiest
and
most
direct
descent
and
ascent
the
brook
separating
from
schon
grabern
the
left
our
troops
were
close
copse
which
smoked
the
bonfires
our
infantry
who
were
felling
wood
the
french
line
was
wider
than
ours
and
was
plain
that
they
could
easily
outflank
both
sides
behind
our
position
was
steep
and
deep
dip
making
difficult
for
artillery
and
cavalry
retire
prince
andrew
took
out
his
notebook
and
leaning
the
cannon
sketched
plan
the
position
made
some
notes
two
points
intending
mention
them
bagration
his
idea
was
first
concentrate
all
the
artillery
the
center
and
secondly
withdraw
the
cavalry
the
other
side
the
dip
prince
andrew
being
always
near
the
commander
chief
closely
following
the
mass
movements
and
general
orders
and
constantly
studying
historical
accounts
battles
involuntarily
pictured
himself
the
course
events
the
forthcoming
action
broad
outline
imagined
only
important
possibilities
the
enemy
attacks
the
right
flank
said
himself
the
kiev
grenadiers
and
the
podolsk
chasseurs
must
hold
their
position
till
reserves
from
the
center
come
that
case
the
dragoons
could
successfully
make
flank
counterattack
they
attack
our
center
having
the
center
battery
this
high
ground
shall
withdraw
the
left
flank
under
its
cover
and
retreat
the
dip
echelons
reasoned
all
the
time
had
been
beside
the
gun
had
heard
the
voices
the
officers
distinctly
but
often
happens
had
not
understood
word
what
they
were
saying
suddenly
however
was
struck
voice
coming
from
the
shed
and
its
tone
was
sincere
that
could
not
but
listen
friend
said
pleasant
and
seemed
prince
andrew
familiar
voice
what
say
that
were
possible
know
what
beyond
death
none
would
afraid
that
friend
another
younger
voice
interrupted
him
afraid
not
you
can
escape
anyhow
all
the
same
one
afraid
you
clever
people
said
third
manly
voice
interrupting
them
both
course
you
artillery
men
are
very
wise
because
you
can
take
everything
along
with
you
vodka
and
snacks
and
the
owner
the
manly
voice
evidently
infantry
officer
laughed
yes
one
afraid
continued
the
first
speaker
the
familiar
voice
one
afraid
the
unknown
that
what
whatever
may
say
about
the
soul
going
the
sky
know
there
sky
but
only
atmosphere
the
manly
voice
again
interrupted
the
artillery
officer
well
stand
some
your
herb
vodka
tushin
said
why
thought
prince
andrew
that
the
captain
who
stood
the
sutler
hut
without
his
boots
recognized
the
agreeable
philosophizing
voice
with
pleasure
some
herb
vodka
certainly
said
tushin
but
still
conceive
future
life
did
not
finish
just
then
there
was
whistle
the
air
nearer
and
nearer
faster
and
louder
louder
and
faster
cannon
ball
had
not
finished
saying
what
was
necessary
thudded
into
the
ground
near
the
shed
with
super
human
force
throwing
mass
earth
the
ground
seemed
groan
the
terrible
impact
and
immediately
tushin
with
short
pipe
the
corner
his
mouth
and
his
kind
intelligent
face
rather
pale
rushed
out
the
shed
followed
the
owner
the
manly
voice
dashing
infantry
officer
who
hurried
off
his
company
buttoning
his
coat
ran
chapter

mounting
his
horse
again
prince
andrew
lingered
with
the
battery
looking
the
puff
from
the
gun
that
had
sent
the
ball
his
eyes
ran
rapidly
over
the
wide
space
but
only
saw
that
the
hitherto
motionless
masses
the
french
now
swayed
and
that
there
really
was
battery
their
left
the
smoke
above
had
not
yet
dispersed
two
mounted
frenchmen
probably
adjutants
were
galloping
the
hill
small
but
distinctly
visible
enemy
column
was
moving
down
the

probably
strengthen
the

the
smoke
the
first
shot
had
not

before
another

appeared
followed
report
the
battle

begun
prince
andrew
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
back
grunth
find
prince
bagration
heard
the
cannonade
behind
him
growing
louder
and
more
frequent
evidently
our
guns
had
begun
reply
from
the
bottom
the
slope
where
the
parleys
had
taken
place
came
the
report
musketry
lemarrois
had
just
arrived

with
bonaparte
stern

and
murat
humiliated
and
anxious
expiate
his
fault
had
once
moved
his
forces
attack
the
center
and
outflank
both
the
russian
wings
hoping
before
evening
and
before
the
arrival
the
emperor
crush
the
contemptible
detachment
that
stood
before
him
has
begun
here
thought
prince
andrew
feeling
the
blood
rush
his
heart
but
where
and
how
will
toulon
present
itself
passing
between
the
companies
that
had
been
eating
porridge
and
drinking
vodka
quarter
hour
before
saw
everywhere
the
same
rapid
movement
soldiers
forming
ranks
and
getting
their
muskets
ready
and
all
their
faces
recognized
the
same
eagerness
that
filled
his
heart
has
begun
here
dreadful
but
enjoyable
was
what
the
face
each
soldier
and
each
officer
seemed
say
before
had
reached
the
embankments
that
were
being
thrown
saw
the
light
the
dull
autumn
evening
mounted
men
coming
toward
him
the
foremost
wearing
cossack

and
lambskin
cap
and
riding
white
horse
was
prince
bagration
prince
andrew
stopped
waiting
for
him
come
prince
bagration
reined
his
horse
and
recognizing
prince
andrew
nodded
him
still
looked
ahead
while
prince
andrew
told
him
what
had
seen
the
feeling
has
begun
here
was
seen
even
prince
bagration
hard
brown
face
with
its
half
closed
dull
sleepy
eyes
prince
andrew
gazed
with
anxious
curiosity
that
impassive
face
and
wished
could
tell
what
anything
this
man
was
thinking
and
feeling
that
moment
there
anything
all
behind
that
impassive
face
prince
andrew
asked
himself
looked
prince
bagration
bent
his
head
sign
agreement
with
what
prince
andrew
told
him
and
said
very
good
tone
that
seemed
imply
that
everything
that
took
place
and
was
reported
him
was
exactly
what
had
foreseen
prince
andrew
out
breath
with
his
rapid
ride
spoke
quickly
prince
bagration
uttering
his
words
with
oriental

the
fact
that
there
was

the

stout

looked
around
him

the

some

could
not

this
time
they

that

hit
with
asked
the

how
awful
seemed
swell
with
satisfaction
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
they
again
heard
unexpectedly
violent
whistling
which
suddenly
ended
with
thud
into
something
soft
flop
and
cossack
riding
little

crashed

with

over

and
turned

away
the

stopped
facing
the

and
examined
him
with
attentive
curiosity
the

was
dead
but

still
struggled

prince
andrew
remembered
the
story
suvorov
giving
his
saber
bagration
italy
and
the
recollection
was
particularly
pleasant
that
moment
they
had
reached
the
battery
which
prince
andrew
had
been
when
examined
the
battlefield
whose
company
asked
prince
bagration
artilleryman
standing
the
ammunition
wagon
asked
whose
company
but
really
meant
are
you
frightened
here
and
the
artilleryman
understood
him
captain
tushin
your
excellency
shouted
the
red
haired
freckled
gunner
merry
voice
standing
attention
yes
yes
muttered
bagration
considering
something
and
rode
past
the
limbers
the
farthest
cannon
approached
ringing
shot
issued
from
deafening
him
and
his
suite
and
the
smoke
that
suddenly
surrounded
the
gun
they
could
see
the
gunners
who
had
seized
straining
roll
quickly
back
its
former
position
huge
broad
shouldered
gunner
number
one
holding
mop
his
legs
far
apart
sprang
the

while

with
trembling

placed

the

mouth
the
short
round
shouldered
captain
tushin
stumbling
over
the
tail
the
gun
carriage
moved
forward
and
not
noticing
the
general
looked
out
shading
his
eyes
with
his
small
hand
lift
two
lines
more
and
will
just
right
cried
feeble
voice
which
tried
impart
dashing

ill
suited
his

medvedev
bagration
called
him
and
tushin
raising
three
fingers
his
cap
with
bashful
and
awkward
gesture
not
all
like
military
salute
but
like
priest
benediction
approached
the
general
though
tushin
guns
had
been
intended
cannonade
the
valley
was
firing
incendiary
balls
the
village
schon
grabern
visible
just
opposite
front
which
large
masses
french
were
advancing
one
had
given
tushin
orders
where
and
what
fire
but
after
consulting
his
sergeant
major
zakharchenko
for
whom
had
great
respect
had
decided
that
would
good
thing
set
fire
the
village
very
good
said
bagration
reply
the
officer
report
and
began
deliberately
examine
the
whole
battlefield
extended
before
him
the
french
had
advanced
nearest
our
right
below
the
height
which
the
kiev
regiment
was
stationed
the
hollow
where
the
rivulet
flowed
the
soul
stirring
rolling
and
crackling
musketry
was
heard
and
much
farther
the
right
beyond
the
dragoons
the
officer
the
suite
pointed
out
bagration
french
column
that
was
outflanking
the
left
the
horizon
bounded
the
adjacent
wood
prince
bagration
ordered
two
battalions
from
the
center
sent
reinforce
the
right
flank
the
officer
the
suite
ventured
remark
the
prince
that
these
battalions
went
away
the
guns
would
remain
without
support
prince
bagration
turned
the
officer
and
with
his
dull
eyes
looked
him
silence
seemed
prince
andrew
that
the
officer
remark
was
just
and
that
really
answer
could
made
but
that
moment
adjutant
galloped
with
message
from
the
commander
the
regiment
the
hollow
and
news
that
immense
masses
the
french
were
coming
down
upon
them
and
that
his
regiment
was
disorder
and
was
retreating
upon
the
kiev
grenadiers
prince
bagration
bowed
his
head
sign
assent
and
approval
rode
off
walk
the
right
and
sent
adjutant
the
dragoons
with
orders
attack
the
french
but
this
adjutant
returned
half
hour
later
with
the
news
that
the
commander
the
dragoons
had
already
retreated
beyond
the
dip
the
ground
heavy
fire
had
been
opened
him
and
was
losing
men
uselessly
and
had
hastened
throw
some
sharpshooters
into
the
wood
very
good
said
bagration
was
leaving
the
battery
firing
was
heard
the
left
also
and
was
too
far
the
left
flank
for
him
have
time
there
himself
prince
bagration
sent
zherkov
tell
the
general
command
the
one
who
had
paraded
his
regiment
before
kutuzov
braunau
that
must
retreat
quickly
possible
behind
the
hollow
the
rear
the
right
flank
would
probably
not
able
withstand
the
enemy
attack
very
long
about
tushin
and
the
battalion
that
had
been
support
his
battery
all
was
forgotten
prince
andrew
listened
attentively
bagration
colloquies
with
the
commanding
officers
and
the
orders
gave
them
and
his
surprise
found
that
orders
were
really
given
but
that
prince
bagration
tried
make
appear
that
everything
done
necessity
accident
the
will
subordinate
commanders
was
done
not
his
direct
command
least
accord
with
his
intentions
prince
andrew
noticed
however
that
though
what
happened
was
due
chance
and
was
independent
the
commander
will
owing
the
tact
bagration
showed
his
presence
was
very
valuable
officers
who
approached
him
with
disturbed
countenances
became
calm
soldiers
and
officers
greeted
him
gaily
grew
more
cheerful
his
presence
and
were
evidently
anxious
display
their
courage
before
him
chapter

prince
bagration
having
reached
the
highest
point
our
right
flank
began
riding
downhill
where
the
roll
musketry
was
heard
but
where
account
the
smoke
nothing
could
seen
the
nearer
they
got
the
hollow
the
less
they
could
see
but
the
more
they
felt
the
nearness
the
actual
battlefield
they
began
meet
wounded
men
one
with
bleeding
head
and
cap
was
being
dragged
along
two
soldiers
who
supported
him
under
the
arms
there
was
gurgle
his
throat
and
was
spitting
blood
bullet
had
evidently
hit
him
the
throat
mouth
another
was
walking
sturdily
himself
but
without
his
musket
groaning
aloud
and
swinging
his
arm
which
had
just
been
hurt
while
blood
from
was
streaming
over
his
greatcoat
from
bottle
had
that
moment
been
wounded
and
his
face
showed
fear
rather
than
suffering
crossing
road
they
descended
steep
incline
and
saw
several
men
lying
the
ground
they
also
met
crowd
soldiers
some
whom
were
unwounded
the
soldiers
were
ascending
the
hill
breathing
heavily
and
despite
the
general
presence
were
talking
loudly
and
gesticulating
front
them
rows
gray
cloaks
were
already
visible
through
the
smoke
and
officer
catching

bagration
rushed
shouting
after
the

ordering
them
back

rode
the

along
which
shots
crackled

and
now
there
drowning

and
the

the
whole
air
reeked
with

the
excited
faces
the
soldiers
were
blackened
with
some

using
their
ramrods
others
putting
powder
the

taking
charges
from
their

while
others
were
firing
though
who
they
were
firing
could
not
seen
for
the
smoke
which
there
was
wind
carry
away
pleasant
humming
and
whistling
bullets
were
often
heard
what
this
thought
prince

approaching
the

can
attack
for
they
are
not

square
for

welcomed
him

honored

reported
that
his
regiment
had
been
attacked
french
cavalry
and
that
though
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
had
lost
more
than
half
his
men
said
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
employing
this
military
term
describe
what
had
occurred
his
regiment
but
reality
did
not
himself
know
what
had
happened
during
that
half
hour
the
troops
entrusted
him
and
could
not
say
with
certainty
whether
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
his
regiment
had
been
broken
all
knew
was
that
the
commencement
the
action
balls
and
shells
began
flying
all
over
his
regiment
and
hitting
men
and
that
afterwards
someone
had
shouted
cavalry
and
our
men
had
begun
firing
they
were
still
firing
not
the
cavalry
which
had
disappeared
but
french
infantry
who
had
come
into
the
hollow
and
were
firing
our
men
prince

bowed
his

that
this
was
exactly
what

desired

turning
his

ordered
him

down
the

the
sixth

they
had
just
passed
prince
andrew
was
struck
the
changed
expression
prince

face
this
moment
expressed
the
concentrated
and
happy
resolution
you
see
the
face
man
who
hot

takes
final
run
before
plunging
into
the
water
the
dull
sleepy
expression
was
longer
there
nor
the
affectation
profound
thought
the
round
steady
hawk
eyes
looked
before
him
eagerly
and
rather
disdainfully
not
resting
anything
although
his
movements
were
still
slow
and
measured
the

the

turned
prince
bagration
entreating
him
back
was

they
were

saying
glancing
for

officer
the

who
turned
away
from
him
there
you
see
and
drew
attention
the
bullets

and
hissing
continually
around
them
spoke
the

reproach
that

but
you

will
blister

spoke
those
bullets
could
not
kill
him
and
his
half
closed
eyes
gave
still
more
persuasiveness
his
words
the
staff
officer
joined
the
colonel
appeals
but
bagration
did
not
reply
only
gave
order

fastened
involuntarily

against
them

winding
down

yourself
colonel
not
considering
own
pleasure
and
won
allow
said
taking
the
colonel
outburst
challenge
his
courage
the
general
expanded
his
chest
and
rode
frowning
beside
him
the
front
line
their
differences
would
settled
there
amongst
the
bullets
they
reached
the
front
several
bullets
sped
over
them
and
they
halted
silence
there
was
nothing
fresh
seen
from
the
line
for
from
where
they
had
been
before
had
been
evident
that
was
impossible
for
cavalry
act
among
the
bushes
and
broken
ground
well
that
the
french
were
outflanking
our
left
the
general
and
colonel
looked
sternly
and
significantly
one
another
like
two
fighting
cocks
preparing
for
battle
each
vainly
trying
detect
signs
cowardice
the
other
both
passed
the
examination
successfully
there
was
nothing
said
and
neither
wished
give
occasion
for
alleged
that
had
been
the
first
leave
the
range
fire
they
would
have
remained
there
for
long
time
testing
each
other
courage
had
not
been
that
just
then
they
heard
the
rattle
musketry
and
muffled
shout
almost
behind
them
the
wood
the
french
had
attacked
the
men
collecting
wood
the
copse
was
longer
possible
for
the
hussars
retreat
with
the
infantry
they
were
cut
off
from
the
line
retreat
the
left
the
french
however
inconvenient
the
position
was
now
necessary
attack
order
cut
way
through
for
themselves
the
squadron
which
rostov
was
serving
had
scarcely
time
mount
before
was
halted
facing
the
enemy
again
the
enns
bridge
there
was
nothing
between
the
squadron
and
the
enemy
and
again
that
terrible
dividing
line
uncertainty
and
fear
resembling
the
line
separating
the
living
from
the
dead
lay
between
them
all
were
conscious
this
unseen
line
and
the
question
whether
they
would
cross
not
and
how
they
would
cross
agitated
them
all
the
colonel
rode
the
front
angrily
gave
some
reply
questions
put
him
the
officers
and
like
man
desperately
insisting
having
his
own
way
gave
order
one
said
anything
definite
but
the
rumor
attack
spread
through
the
squadron
the
command
form
rang
out
and
the
sabers
whizzed
they
were
drawn
from
their
scabbards
still
one
moved
the
troops
the
left
flank
infantry
and
hussars
alike
felt
that
the
commander
did
not
himself
know
what
and
this
irresolution
communicated
itself
the
men
only
they
would
quick
thought
rostov
feeling
that
last
the
time
had
come
experience
the
joy
attack
which
had
often
heard
from
his
fellow
hussars
ward
with
god
lads
rang
out
denisov
voice
twot
ward
the
horses
croups
began
sway
the
front
line
rook
pulled
the
reins
and
started
his
own
accord
before
him
the
right
rostov
saw
the
front
lines
his
hussars
and
still
farther
ahead
dark
line
which
could
not
see
distinctly
but
took
the
enemy
shots
could
heard
but
some
way
off
faster
came
the
word
command
and
rostov
felt
rook
flanks
drooping
broke
into
gallop
rostov
anticipated
his
horse
movements
and
became
more
and
more
elated
had
noticed
solitary
tree
ahead
him
this
tree
had
been
the
middle
the
line
that
had
seemed
terrible
and
now
had
crossed
that
line
and
not
only
was
there
nothing
terrible
but
everything
was
becoming
more
and
more
happy
and
animated
how
will
slash
him
thought
rostov
gripping
the
hilt
his
saber
hur
came
roar
voices
let
anyone
come
way
now
thought
rostov
driving
his
spurs
into
rook
and
letting
him
full
gallop
that
outstripped
the
others
ahead
the
enemy
was
already
visible
suddenly
something
like
birch
broom
seemed
sweep
over
the
squadron
rostov
raised
his
saber
ready
strike
but
that
instant
the
trooper
nikitenko
who
was
galloping
ahead
shot
away
from
him
and
rostov
felt
dream
that
continued
carried
forward
with
unnatural
speed
but
yet
stayed
the
same
spot
from
behind
him
bondarchuk
hussar
knew
jolted
against
him
and
looked
angrily
him
bondarchuk
horse
swerved
and
galloped
past
how
not
moving
have
fallen
killed
rostov
asked
and
answered
the
same
instant
was
alone
the
middle
field
instead
the
moving
horses
and
hussars
backs
saw
nothing
before
him
but
the
motionless
earth
and
the
stubble
around
him
there
was
warm
blood
under
his
arm
wounded
and
the
horse
killed
rook
tried
rise
his
forelegs
but
fell
back
pinning
his
rider
leg
blood
was
flowing
from
his
head
struggled
but
could
not
rise
rostov
also
tried
rise
but
fell
back
his
sabretache
having
become
entangled
the
saddle
where
our
men
were
and
where
the
french
did
not
know
there
was
one
near
having
disentangled
his
leg
rose
where
which
side
was
now
the
line
that
had
sharply
divided
the
two
armies
asked
himself
and
could
not
answer
can
something
bad
have
happened
wondered
got
and
that
moment
felt
that
something
superfluous
was
hanging
his
benumbed
left
arm
the
wrist
felt
were
not
his
examined
his
hand
carefully
vainly
trying
find
blood
here
are
people
coming
thought
joyfully
seeing
some
men
running
toward
him
they
will
help
front
came
man
wearing
strange
shako
and
blue
cloak
swarthy
sunburned
and
with
hooked
nose
then
came
two
more
and
many
more
running
behind
one
them
said
something
strange
not
russian
among
the
hindmost
these
men
wearing
similar
shakos
was
russian
hussar
was
being
held
the
arms
and
his
horse
was
being
led
behind
him
must
one
ours
prisoner
yes
can
that
they
will
take
too
who
are
these
men
thought
rostov
scarcely
believing
his
eyes
can
they
french
looked
the
approaching
frenchmen
and
though
but
moment
before
had
been
galloping
get
them
and
hack
them
pieces
their
proximity
now
seemed
awful
that
could
not
believe
his
eyes
who
are
they
why
are
they
running
can
they
coming
and
why
kill
whom
everyone
fond
remembered
his
mother
love
for
him
and
his
family
and
his
friends
and
the
enemy
intention
kill
him
seemed
impossible
but
perhaps
they
may
for
more
than
ten
seconds
stood
not
moving
from
the
spot
realizing
the
situation
the
foremost
frenchman
the
one
with
the
hooked
nose
was
already
close
that
the
expression
his
face
could
seen
and
the
excited
alien
face
that
man
his
bayonet
hanging
down
holding
his
breath
and
running
lightly
frightened
rostov
seized
his
pistol
and
instead
firing
flung
the
frenchman
and
ran
with
all
his
might
toward
the
bushes
did
not
now
run
with
the
feeling
doubt
and
conflict
with
which
had
trodden
the
enns
bridge
but
with
the
feeling
hare
fleeing
from
the
hounds
one
single
sentiment
that
fear
for
his
young
and
happy
life
possessed
his
whole
being
rapidly
leaping
the
furrows
fled
across
the
field
with
the
impetuosity
used
show
catchplay
now
and
then
turning
his
good
natured
pale
young
face
look
back
shudder
terror
went
through
him
better
not
look
thought
but
having
reached
the
bushes
glanced
round
once
more
the
french
had
fallen
behind
and
just
looked
round
the
first
man
changed
his
run
walk
and
turning
shouted
something
loudly
comrade
farther
back
rostov
paused
there
some
mistake
thought
they
can
have
wanted
kill
but
the
same
time
his
left
arm
felt
heavy
seventy
pound
weight
were
tied
could
run
more
the
frenchman
also
stopped
and
took
aim
rostov
closed
his
eyes
and
stooped
down
one
bullet
and
then
another
whistled
past
him
mustered
his
last
remaining
strength
took
hold
his
left
hand
with
his
right
and
reached
the
bushes
behind
these
were
some
russian
sharpshooters
chapter
the
infantry
regiments
that
had
been
caught
unawares
the
outskirts
the
wood
ran
out
the
different
companies
getting
mixed
and
retreated
disorderly
crowd
one
soldier
his
fear
uttered
the
senseless
cry
cut
off
that
terrible
battle
and
that
word
infected
the
whole
crowd
with
feeling
panic
surrounded
cut
off
lost
shouted
the
fugitives
the
moment
heard
the
firing
and
the
cry
from
behind
the
general
realized
that
something
dreadful
had
happened
his
regiment
and
the
thought
that
exemplary
officer
many
years
service
who
had
never
been
blame
might
held
responsible
headquarters
for
negligence
inefficiency
staggered
him
that
forgetting
the
recalcitrant
cavalry
colonel
his
own
dignity
general
and
above
all
quite
forgetting
the
danger
and
all
regard
for
self
preservation
clutched
the
crupper
his
saddle
and
spurring
his
horse
galloped
the
regiment
under
hail
bullets
which
fell
around
but
fortunately
missed
him
his
one
desire
was
know
what
was
happening
and
any
cost
correct
remedy
the
mistake
had
made
one
that
exemplary
officer
twenty
two
years
service
who
had
never
been
censured
should
not
held
blame
having
galloped
safely
through
the
french
reached
field
behind
the
copse
across
which
our
men
regardless
orders
were
running
and
descending
the
valley
that
moment
moral
hesitation
which
decides
the
fate
battles
had
arrived
would
this
disorderly
crowd
soldiers
attend
the
voice
their
commander
would
they
disregarding
him
continue
their
flight
despite
his
desperate
shouts
that
used
seem
terrible
the
soldiers
despite
his
furious
purple
countenance
distorted
out
all
likeness
his
former
self
and
the
flourishing
his
saber
the
soldiers
all
continued
run
talking
firing
into
the
air
and
disobeying
orders
the
moral
hesitation
which
decided
the
fate
battles
was
evidently
culminating
panic
the
general
had
fit
coughing
result
shouting
and
the
powder
smoke
and
stopped
despair
everything
seemed
lost
but
that
moment
the
french
who
were
attacking
suddenly
and
without
any
apparent
reason
ran
back
and
disappeared
from
the
outskirts
and
russian
sharpshooters
showed
themselves
the
copse
was
timokhin
company
which
alone
had
maintained
its
order
the
wood
and
having
lain
ambush
ditch
now
attacked
the
french
unexpectedly
timokhin
armed
only
with
sword
had
rushed
the
enemy
with
such
desperate
cry
and
such
mad
drunken
determination
that
taken
surprise
the
french
had
thrown
down
their
muskets
and
run
dolokhov
running
beside
timokhin
killed
frenchman
close
quarters
and
was
the
first
seize
the
surrendering
french
officer
his
collar
our
fugitives
returned
the
battalions
formed
and
the
french
who
had
nearly
cut
our
left
flank
half
were
for
the
moment
repulsed
our
reserve
units
were
able
join
and
the
fight
was
end
the
regimental
commander
and
major
ekonomov
had
stopped
beside
bridge
letting
the
retreating
companies
pass
them
when
soldier
came
and
took
hold
the
commander
stirrup
almost
leaning
against
him
the
man
was
wearing
bluish
coat
broadcloth
had
knapsack
cap
his
head
was
bandaged
and
over
his
shoulder
french
munition
pouch
was
slung
had
officer
sword
his
hand
the
soldier
was
pale
his
blue
eyes
looked
impudently
into
the
commander
face
and
his
lips
were
smiling
though
the
commander
was
occupied
giving
instructions
major
ekonomov
could
not
help
taking
notice
the
soldier
your
excellency
here
are
two
trophies
said
dolokhov
pointing
the
french
sword
and
pouch
have
taken
officer

stopped
the
company
dolokhov
breathed
heavily
from
weariness
and
spoke
abrupt
sentences
the
whole
company
can
bear
witness
beg
you
will
remember
this
your
excellency
all
right
all
right
replied
the
commander
and
turned
major
ekonomov
but
dolokhov
did
not
away
untied
the
handkerchief
around
his
head
pulled
off
and
showed
the
blood
congealed
his
hair
bayonet
wound
remained
the
front
remember
your
excellency
tushin
battery
had
been
forgotten
and
only
the
very
end
the
action
did
prince
bagration
still
hearing
the
cannonade
the
center
send
his
orderly
staff
officer
and
later
prince
andrew
also
order
the
battery
retire
quickly
possible
when
the
supports
attached
tushin
battery
had
been
moved
away
the
middle
the
action
someone
order
the
battery
had
continued
firing
and
was
only
not
captured
the
french
because
the
enemy
could
not
surmise
that
anyone
could
have
the
effrontery
continue
firing
from
four
quite
undefended
guns
the
contrary
the
energetic
action
that
battery
led
the
french
suppose
that
here
the
center
the
main
russian
forces
were
concentrated
twice
they
had
attempted
attack
this
point
but
each
occasion
had
been
driven
back
grapeshot
from
the
four
isolated
guns
the
hillock
soon
after
prince
bagration
had
left
him
tushin
had
succeeded
setting
fire

scurrying
burning
just
see
the
smoke
fine
grand

the
smoke
the
smoke
exclaimed
the
artillerymen
brightening
all
the

without
waiting
for

being

the

the

was
rapidly
spreading
the
french
columns
that
had
advanced
beyond
the
village
went
back
but
though
revenge
for
this
failure
the
enemy
placed
ten
guns
the
right
the
village
and
began
firing
them
tushin
battery
their
childlike
glee
aroused
the
fire
and
their
luck
successfully
cannonading
the
french
our
artillerymen
only
noticed
this
battery
when
two
balls
and
then
four
more
fell
among
our
guns
one
knocking
over
two
horses
and
another
tearing
off
munition
wagon
driver
leg
their
spirits
once
roused
were
however
not
diminished
but
only
changed
character
the
horses
were
replaced
others
from
reserve
gun
carriage
the
wounded
were
carried
away
and
the
four
guns
were
turned
against
the
ten
gun
battery
tushin
companion
officer
had
been
killed
the
beginning
the
engagement
and
within
hour
seventeen
the
forty
men
the
guns
crews
had
been
disabled
but
the
artillerymen
were
still
merry
and
lively
ever
twice
they
noticed
the
french
appearing
below
them
and
then
they
fired
grapeshot
them
little
tushin
moving
feebly
and
awkwardly
kept
telling
his
orderly
refill
pipe
for
that
one
and
then
scattering
sparks
from
ran
forward
shading
his
eyes
with
his
small
hand
look
the
french
smack
lads
kept
saying
seizing
the
guns
the
wheels
and
working
the
screws
himself
amid
the
smoke
deafened
the
incessant
reports
which
always
made
him
jump
tushin
not
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
ran
from
gun
gun
now
aiming
now
counting
the
charges
now
giving
orders
about
replacing
dead
wounded
horses
and
harnessing
fresh
ones
and
shouting
his
feeble
voice
high
pitched
and
irresolute
his
face
grew
more
and
more
animated
only
when
man
was
killed
wounded
did
frown
and
turn
away
from
the
sight
shouting
angrily
the
men
who
always
the
case
hesitated
about
lifting
the
injured
dead
the
soldiers
for
the
most
part
handsome
fellows
and
always
the
case
artillery
company
head
and
shoulders
taller
and
twice
broad
their
officer
all
looked
their
commander
like
children
embarrassing
situation
and
the
expression
his
face
was
invariably
reflected
theirs
owing
the
terrible
uproar
and
the
necessity
for
concentration
and
activity
tushin
did
not
experience
the
slightest
unpleasant
sense
fear
and
the
thought
that
might
killed
badly
wounded
never
occurred
him
the
contrary
became
more
and
more
elated
seemed
him
that
was
very
long
time
ago
almost
day
since
had
first
seen
the
enemy
and
fired
the
first
shot
and
that
the
corner
the
field
stood
was
well
known
and
familiar
ground
though
thought
everything
considered
everything
and
did
everything
the
best
officers
could
his
position
was
state
akin
feverish
delirium
drunkenness
from
the
deafening
sounds
his
own
guns
around
him
the
whistle
and
thud
the
enemy
cannon
balls
from
the
flushed
and
perspiring
faces
the
crew
bustling
round
the
guns
from
the
sight
the
blood
men
and
horses
from
the
little
puffs
smoke
the
enemy
side
always
followed
ball
flying
past
and
striking
the
earth
man
gun
horse
from
the
sight
all
these
things
fantastic
world
his
own
had
taken
possession
his
brain
and
that
moment
afforded
him
pleasure
the
enemy
guns
were
his
fancy
not
guns
but
pipes
from
which
occasional
puffs
were
blown
invisible
smoker
there
puffing
again
muttered
tushin
himself
small
cloud
rose
from
the
hill
and
was
borne

the

out
for

answered

said
himself
matvevna
was
the
name
his
fancy
gave
the
farthest
gun
the
battery
which
was
large
and
old
pattern
the
french
swarming
round
their
guns
seemed
him
like
ants
that

the

the

tushin
looked
him
more
often
than
anyone
else
and
took
delight
his
every
movement
the
sound
musketry
the
foot
the
hill
now
diminishing
now
increasing
seemed
like
someone
breathing

intently
the

these
sounds

matvevna
dear

moved
from
the
gun
when
strange
unfamiliar
voice
called
above
his
head
captain
tushin
captain
tushin
turned
round
dismay
was
the
staff

who
had
turned

out

down
thought
tushin
looking
alarm
his
superior
don
muttered
holding
two
fingers
his
cap
but
the
staff
officer
did
not
finish
what
wanted
say
cannon
ball
flying
close
him
caused
him
duck
and
bend
over
his
horse
paused
and
just
was
about
say
something
more
another
ball
stopped
him
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
off
retire
all

shouted
from
distance
the
soldiers
laughed
moment
later
adjutant
arrived
with
the
same
order
was
prince
andrew
the
first
thing
saw
riding
the
space
where
tushin
guns
were
stationed
was
unharnessed
horse
with
broken
leg
that
lay
screaming
piteously
beside
the
harnessed
horses
blood
was
gushing
from
its
leg
from
spring
among
the
limbers
lay
several
dead
men
one
ball
after
another
passed
over
approached
and
felt
nervous
shudder
run
down
his
spine
but
the
mere
thought
being
afraid
roused
him
again
cannot
afraid
thought
and
dismounted
slowly
among
the
guns
delivered
the
order
and
did
not
leave
the
battery
decided
have
the
guns
removed
from
their
positions
and
withdrawn
his
presence
together
with
tushin
stepping
across
the
bodies
and
under
terrible
fire
from
the
french
attended
the
removal
the
guns

here
minute
ago

said
artilleryman
prince

not
like
your

prince
andrew
said
nothing
tushin
they
were
both
busy
seem
not
notice
one
another
when
having
limbered
the
only
two
cannon
that
remained
uninjured
out
the
four
they
began
moving
down
the
hill
one
shattered
gun
and
one
unicorn
were
left
behind
prince
andrew
rode
tushin
well
till
meet
again
said
holding
out
his
hand
tushin
good
bye
dear
fellow
said
tushin
dear
soul
good
bye
dear
fellow
and
for
some
unknown
reason
tears
suddenly
filled
his
eyes
chapter
xxi
the
wind
had
fallen
and
black
clouds
merging
with
the
powder
smoke
hung
low
over
the
field
battle
the
horizon
was
growing
dark
and
the
glow
two
conflagrations
was
the
more
conspicuous
the
cannonade
was
dying
down
but
the
rattle
musketry
behind
and
the
right
sounded
oftener
and
nearer
soon
tushin
with
his
guns
continually
driving
round
coming
upon
wounded
men
was
out
range
fire
and
had
descended
into
the
dip
was
met
some
the
staff
among
them
the
staff
officer
and
zherkov
who
had
been
twice
sent
tushin
battery
but
had
never
reached
interrupting
one
another
they
all
gave
and
transmitted
orders
how
proceed
reprimanding
and
reproaching
him
tushin
gave
orders
and
silently
fearing
speak
because
every
word
felt
ready
weep
without
knowing
why
rode
behind
his
artillery
nag
though
the
orders
were
abandon
the
wounded
many
them
dragged
themselves
after
troops
and
begged
for
seats
the
gun
carriages
the
jaunty
infantry
officer
who
just
before
the
battle
had
rushed
out
tushin

feverishly
was
placed
matvevna
the
gun
from
which
they
had
removed
the
dead
officer
the
cloak
they
spread
under
him
was
wet
with
blood
which
stained
his
breeches
and
arm
what
are

said
tushin
approaching
the
gun
which
rostov
sat
sprain
then
what
this
blood
the
gun
carriage
inquired
tushin
was
the
officer

answered
the
artilleryman
wiping
away
the
blood
with
his
coat
sleeve
apologizing
for
the
state
his
gun
was
all
that
they
could
get
the
guns
the
rise
aided
the
infantry
and
having
reached
the
village
gruntersdorf
they
halted
had
grown
dark
that
one
could
not
distinguish
the
uniforms
ten
paces
off
and
the
firing
had
begun
subside
suddenly
near
the
right
shouting
and
firing
were
again
heard
flashes
shot
gleamed
the
darkness
this
was
the
last
french
attack
and
was
met
soldiers
who
had
sheltered
the
village
houses
they
all
rushed
out
the
village
again
but
tushin
guns
could
not
move
and
the
artillerymen
tushin
and
the
cadet
exchanged
silent
glances
they
awaited
their
fate
the
firing
died
down
and
soldiers
talking
eagerly
streamed
out
side
street
not
hurt
petrov
asked
one
given
hot
mate
they
won
make
another
push
now
said
another
you
couldn

how
they
shot
their

isn
there
something
drink
the
french
had
been
repulsed
for
the
last
time
and
again
and
again
the
complete
darkness
tushin
guns
moved
forward
surrounded
the
humming
infantry
frame
the
darkness
seemed
though
gloomy
unseen
river
was
flowing
always
one
direction
humming
with
whispers
and
talk
and
the
sound
hoofs
and
wheels
amid
the
general
rumble
the
groans
and
voices
the
wounded
were
more
distinctly
heard
than
any
other
sound
the
darkness
the
night
the
gloom
that
enveloped
the
army
was
filled
with
their
groans
which
seemed
melt
into
one
with
the
darkness
the
night
after
while
the
moving
mass
became
agitated
someone
rode
past
white
horse
followed
his
suite
and
said
something
passing
what
did
say
where
now
halt
did
thank
came
eager
questions
from
all
sides
the
whole
moving
mass
began
pressing
closer
together
and
report
spread
that
they
were
ordered
halt
evidently
those
front
had
halted
all
remained
where
they
were
the
middle
the
muddy
road
fires
were
lighted
and
the
talk
became
more
audible
captain
tushin
having
given
orders
his
company
sent
soldier
find
dressing
station
doctor
for
the
cadet
and
sat
down
bonfire
the
soldiers
had
kindled
the
road
rostov
too
dragged
himself
the
fire
from
pain
cold
and
damp
feverish
shivering
shook
his
whole
body
drowsiness
was
irresistibly
mastering
him
but
kept
awake
excruciating
pain
his
arm
for
which
could
find
satisfactory
position
kept
closing
his
eyes
and
then
again
looking
the
fire
which
seemed
him
dazzlingly
red
and
the
feeble
round
shouldered
figure
tushin
who
was
sitting
cross
legged
like
turk
beside
him
tushin
large
kind
intelligent
eyes
were
fixed
with
sympathy
and
commiseration
rostov
who
saw
that
tushin
with
his
whole
heart
wished
help
him
but
could
not
from
all
sides
were
heard
the
footsteps
and
talk
the
infantry
who
were
walking
driving
past
and
settling
down
all
around
the
sound
voices
the
tramping
feet
the
horses
hoofs
moving
mud
the
crackling
wood
fires
near
and
afar
merged
into
one
tremulous
rumble
was
longer
before
dark
unseen
river
flowing
through
the
gloom
but
dark
sea
swelling
and
gradually
subsiding
after
storm
rostov
looked
and
listened
listlessly
what
passed
before
and
around
him
infantryman
came
the
fire
squatted
his
heels
held
his
hands
the
blaze
and
turned
away
his
face
you
don
mind
your
honor
asked
tushin
lost
company
your
honor
don
know
where
such
bad
luck
with
the
soldier
infantry
officer
with
bandaged
cheek
came
the
bonfire
and
addressing
tushin
asked
him
have
the
guns
moved
trifle
let
wagon
past
after
had
gone
two
soldiers
rushed
the
campfire
they
were
quarreling
and
fighting
desperately
each
trying
snatch
from
the
other
boot
they
were
both
holding
you
picked
dare
say
you
very
smart
one
them
shouted
hoarsely
then
thin
pale
soldier
his
neck
bandaged
with
bloodstained
leg
band
came
and
angry
tones
asked
the
artillerymen
for
water
must
one
die
like
dog
said
tushin
told
them
give
the
man
some
water
then
cheerful
soldier
ran
begging
little
fire
for
the
infantry
nice
little
hot
torch
for
the
infantry
good
luck
you
fellow
countrymen
thanks
for
the
fire
return
with
interest
said
carrying
away
into
the
darkness
glowing
stick
next
came
four
soldiers
carrying
something
heavy
cloak
and
passed
the
fire
one
them
stumbled
who
the
devil
has
put
the
logs
the
road
snarled
dead
why
carry
him
said
another
shut
and
they
disappeared
into
the
darkness
with
their
load
still
aching
tushin
asked
rostov
whisper
yes
your
honor
you
wanted
the
general
the
hut
here
said
gunner
coming
tushin
coming
friend
tushin
rose
and
buttoning
his
greatcoat
and
pulling
straight
walked
away
from
the
fire
not
far
from
the
artillery
campfire
hut
that
had
been
prepared
for
him
prince
bagration
sat
dinner
talking
with
some
commanding
officers
who
had
gathered
his
quarters
the
little
old
man
with
the
half
closed
eyes
was
there
greedily
gnawing
mutton
bone
and
the
general
who
had
served
blamelessly
for
twenty
two
years
flushed
glass
vodka
and
the
dinner
and
the
staff
officer
with
the
signet
ring
and
zherkov
uneasily
glancing
them
all
and
prince
andrew
pale
with
compressed
lips
and
feverishly
glittering
eyes
corner
the
hut
stood
standard
captured
from
the
french
and
the
accountant
with
the
naive
face
was
feeling
its
texture
shaking
his
head
perplexity
perhaps
because
the
banner
really
interested
him
perhaps
because
was
hard
for
him
hungry
was
look
dinner
where
there
was
place
for
him
the
next
hut
there
was
french
colonel
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
our
dragoons
our
officers
were
flocking
look
him
prince
bagration
was
thanking
the
individual
commanders
and
inquiring
into
details
the
action
and
our
losses
the
general
whose
regiment
had
been
inspected
braunau
was
informing
the
prince
that
soon
the
action
began
had
withdrawn
from
the
wood
mustered
the
men
who
were
woodcutting
and
allowing
the
french
pass
him
had
made
bayonet
charge
with
two
battalions
and
had
broken
the
french
troops
when
saw
your
excellency
that
their
first
battalion
was
disorganized
stopped
the
road
and
thought
let
them
come
and
will
meet
them
with
the
fire
the
whole
battalion
and
that
what
did
the
general
had
wished
this
and
was
sorry
had
not
managed
that
seemed
him
had
really
happened
perhaps
might
really
have
been
could
one
possibly
make
out
amid
all
that
confusion
what
did
did
not
happen
the
way
your
excellency
should
inform
you
continued
remembering
dolokhov
conversation
with
kutuzov
and
his
last
interview
with
the
gentleman
ranker
that
private
dolokhov
who
was
reduced
the
ranks
took
french
officer
prisoner
presence
and
particularly
distinguished
himself
saw
the
pavlograd
hussars
attack
there
your
excellency
chimed
zherkov
looking
uneasily
around
had
not
seen
the
hussars
all
that
day
but
had
heard
about
them
from
infantry
officer
they
broke
two
squares
your
excellency
several
those
present
smiled
zherkov
words
expecting
one
his
usual
jokes
but
noticing
that
what
was
saying
redounded
the
glory
our
arms
and
the
day
work
they
assumed
serious
expression
though
many
them
knew
that
what
was
saying
was
lie
devoid
any
foundation
prince
bagration
turned
the
old
colonel
gentlemen
thank
you
all
all
arms
have
behaved
heroically
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
how
was
that
two
guns
were
abandoned
the
center
inquired
searching
with
his
eyes
for
someone
prince
bagration
did
not
ask
about
the
guns
the
left
flank
knew
that
all
the
guns
there
had
been
abandoned
the
very
beginning
the
action
think
sent
you
added
turning
the
staff
officer
duty
one
was
damaged
answered
the
staff
officer
and
the
other
can
understand
was
there
all
the
time
giving
orders
and
had
only
just
left
true
that
was
hot
there
added
modestly
someone
mentioned
that
captain
tushin
was
bivouacking
close
the
village
and
had
already
been
sent
for
but
you
were
there
said
prince
bagration
addressing
prince
andrew
course
only
just
missed
one
another
said
the
staff
officer
with
smile
bolkonski
had
not
the
pleasure
seeing
you
said
prince
andrew
coldly
and
abruptly
all
were
silent
tushin
appeared
the
threshold
and
made
his
way
timidly
from
behind
the
backs
the
generals
stepped
past
the
generals
the
crowded
hut
feeling
embarrassed
always
was
the
sight
his
superiors
did
not
notice
the
staff
the
banner
and
stumbled
over
several
those
present
laughed
how
was
gun
was
abandoned
asked
bagration
frowning
not
much
the
captain
those
who
were
laughing
among
whom
zherkov
laughed
loudest
only
now
when
was
confronted
the
stern
authorities
did
his
guilt
and
the
disgrace
having
lost
two
guns
and
yet
remaining
alive
present
themselves
tushin
all
their
horror
had
been
excited
that
had
not
thought
about
until
that
moment
the
officers
laughter
confused
him
still
more
stood
before
bagration
with
his
lower
jaw
trembling
and
was
hardly
able
mutter
don
know
your
excellency
had
men
your
excellency
you
might
have
taken
some
from
the
covering
troops
tushin
did
not
say
that
there
were
covering
troops
though
that
was
perfectly
true
was
afraid
getting
some
other
officer
into
trouble
and
silently
fixed
his
eyes
bagration
schoolboy
who
has
blundered
looks
examiner
the
silence
lasted
some
time
prince
bagration
apparently
not
wishing
severe
found
nothing
say
the
others
did
not
venture
intervene
prince
andrew
looked
tushin
from
under
his
brows
and
his
fingers
twitched
nervously
your
excellency
prince
andrew
broke
the
silence
with
his
abrupt
voice
you
were
pleased
send
captain
tushin
battery
went
there
and
found
two
thirds
the
men
and
horses
knocked
out
two
guns
smashed
and
supports
all
prince
bagration
and
tushin
looked
with
equal
intentness
bolkonski
who
spoke
with
suppressed
agitation
and
your
excellency
will
allow
express
opinion
continued
owe
today
success
chiefly
the
action
that
battery
and
the
heroic
endurance
captain
tushin
and
his
company
and
without
awaiting
reply
prince
andrew
rose
and
left
the
table
prince
bagration
looked
tushin
evidently
reluctant
show
distrust
bolkonski
emphatic
opinion
yet
not
feeling
able
fully
credit
bent
his
head
and
told
tushin
that
could
prince
andrew
went
out
with
him
thank
you
you
saved
dear
fellow
said
tushin
prince
andrew
gave
him
look
but
said
nothing
and
went
away
felt
sad
and
depressed
was
all
strange
unlike
what
had
hoped
who
are
they
why
are
they
here
what
they
want
and
when
will
all
this
end
thought
rostov
looking
the
changing
shadows
before
him
the
pain
his
arm
became
more
and
more
intense
irresistible
drowsiness
overpowered
him
red
rings
danced
before
his
eyes
and
the
impression
those
voices
and
faces
and
sense
loneliness
merged
with
the
physical
pain
was
they
these
soldiers
wounded
and
unwounded
was
they
who
were
crushing
weighing
down
and
twisting
the
sinews
and
scorching
the
flesh
his
sprained
arm
and
shoulder
rid
himself
them
closed
his
eyes
for
moment
dozed
but
that
short
interval
innumerable
things
appeared
him
dream
his
mother
and
her
large
white
hand
sonya
thin
little
shoulders
natasha
eyes
and
laughter
denisov
with
his
voice
and
mustache
and
telyanin
and
all
that
affair
with
telyanin
and
bogdanich
that
affair
was
the
same
thing
this
soldier
with
the
harsh
voice
and
was
that
affair
and
this
soldier
that
were
agonizingly
incessantly
pulling
and
pressing
his
arm
and
always
dragging
one
direction
tried
get
away
from
them
but
they
would
not
for
instant
let
his
shoulder
move
hair
breadth
would
not
ache
would
well
only
they
did
not
pull
but
was
impossible
get
rid
them
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
the
black
canopy
night
hung
less
than
yard
above
the
glow
the
charcoal
flakes
falling
snow
were
fluttering
that
light
tushin
had
not
returned
the
doctor
had
not
come
was
alone
now
except
for
soldier
who
was
sitting
naked
the
other
side
the
fire
warming
his
thin
yellow
body
nobody
wants
thought
rostov
there
one
help
pity
yet
was
once
home
strong
happy
and
loved
sighed
and
doing
groaned
involuntarily
anything
hurting
you
asked
the
soldier
shaking
his
shirt
out
over
the
fire
and
not
waiting
for
answer
gave
grunt

for

after

receive
many
people
who
formerly
did

but
would
now
have
been
offended
and
grieved
had
chosen
not
see

these
different

and
acquaintances
alike
were
all
disposed
treat
the
young

the
most
friendly
and
flattering
manner
they
were
all
evidently
firmly
convinced
pierre
noble
qualities
was
always
hearing
such
words
with
your
remarkable
kindness
with
your
excellent
heart
you
are
yourself
honorable
count
were
clever
you
and
till
began
sincerely
believe
his
own
exceptional
kindness
and
extraordinary
intelligence
the
more
the
depth
his
heart
had
always
seemed
him
that
really
was
very
kind
and
intelligent
even
people
who
had
formerly
been
spiteful
toward
him
and
evidently
unfriendly
now
became
gentle
and
affectionate
the
angry
eldest
princess
with
the
long
waist
and
hair
plastered
down
like
doll
had
come
into
pierre
room
after
the
funeral
with
drooping
eyes
and
frequent
blushes
she
told
him
she
was
very
sorry
about
their
past
misunderstandings
and
did
not
now
feel
she
had
right
ask
him
for
anything
except
only
for
permission
after
the
blow
she
had
received
remain
for
few
weeks
longer
the
house
she
loved
and
where
she
had
sacrificed
much
she
could
not
refrain
from
weeping
these
words
touched
that
this
statuesque
princess
could
change
pierre
took
her
hand
and
begged
her
forgiveness
without
knowing
what
for
from
that
day
the
eldest
princess
quite
changed
toward
pierre
and
began
knitting
striped

for
him

for

had
put
with

deal
from
the

handing
him

for
the
princess
benefit
prince
vasili
had
come
the
conclusion
that
was
necessary
throw
this
bone
bill
for
thirty
thousand
rubles
the
poor
princess
that
might
not
occur
her
speak
his
share
the
affair
the
inlaid
portfolio
pierre
signed
the
deed
and
after
that
the
princess
grew
still
kinder
the
younger
sisters
also
became
affectionate
him
especially
the
youngest
the
pretty
one
with
the
mole
who
often
made
him
feel
confused
her
smiles
and
her
own
confusion
when
meeting
him
seemed
natural
pierre
that
everyone
should
like
him
and
would
have
seemed
unnatural
had
anyone
disliked
him
that
could
not
but
believe
the
sincerity
those
around
him
besides
had
time
ask
himself
whether
these
people
were
sincere
not
was
always
busy
and
always
felt
state
mild
and
cheerful
intoxication

though
were
the
center
some
important
and
general
movement
that
something
was
constantly
expected
him
that
did
not
would
grieve
and
disappoint
many
people
but
did
this
and
that
all
would
well
and
did
what
was
demanded
him
but
still
that
happy
result
always
remained
the
future
more
than
anyone
else
prince
vasili
took
possession

with
which
these
words
were
pronounced
pierre
who
had
long
been
considering
his
career
wished
make
some
suggestion
but
prince
vasili
interrupted
him
the
special
deep
cooing
tone
precluding
the
possibility
interrupting
his
speech
which
used
extreme
cases
when
special
persuasion
was
needed

the
change

toward

that
had
taken
place

formerly
anna
pavlovna
presence
pierre
had
always
felt
that
what
was
saying
was
out
place
tactless
and
unsuitable
that
remarks
which
seemed
him
clever
while
they
formed
his
mind
became
foolish
soon
uttered
them
while
the
contrary
hippolyte
stupidest
remarks
came
out
clever
and
apt
now
everything
pierre
said
was
charmant
even
anna
pavlovna
did
not
say
could
see
that
she
wished
and
only
refrained
out
regard
for
his
modesty
the
beginning
the
winter
pierre
received
one
anna
pavlovna
usual
pink
notes
with
invitation
which
was
added
you
will
find
the
beautiful
helene
here
whom
always
delightful
see
when
read
that
sentence
pierre
felt
for
the
first
time
that
some
link
which
other
people
recognized
had
grown
between
himself
and
helene
and
that
thought
both
alarmed
him
some
obligation
were
being
imposed
him
which
could
not
fulfill
and
pleased
him
entertaining
supposition
anna
pavlovna
home
was
like
the
former
one
only
the
novelty
she
offered
her
guests
this
time
was
not
mortemart
but
diplomatist
fresh
from
berlin
with
the
very
latest
details

and
how
the
two
august
friends
had
pledged
themselves
indissoluble
alliance

the
cause
justice
against
the
enemy
the
human
race
anna
pavlovna
received
pierre
with
shade
melancholy
evidently
relating
the
young
man
recent
loss
the
death
count
bezukhov
everyone
constantly
considered
duty
assure
pierre
that
was
greatly
afflicted
the
death
the
father
had
hardly
known
and
her
melancholy
was
just
like
the
august
melancholy
she
showed
the
mention
her
most
august
majesty
the
empress
marya
fedorovna
pierre
felt
flattered
this
anna
pavlovna
arranged
the
different
groups
her
drawing
room
with
her
habitual
skill
the
large
group
which
were
prince
vasili
and
the
generals
had
the
benefit
the
diplomat
another
group
was
the
tea
table
pierre
wished
join
the
former
but
anna
pavlovna
who
was
the
excited
condition
commander
battlefield
whom
thousands
new
and
brilliant
ideas
occur
which
there
hardly
time
put
action
seeing
pierre
touched
his
sleeve
with
her
finger
saying
wait
bit
have
something
view
for
you
this
evening
she
glanced
helene
and
smiled
her
dear
helene
charitable
poor
aunt
who
adores
you
and
keep
her
company
for
ten
minutes
and
that
will
not
too
dull
here
the
dear
count
who
will
not
refuse
accompany
you
the
beauty
went
the
aunt
but
anna
pavlovna
detained
pierre
looking
she
had
give
some
final
necessary
instructions
isn
she
exquisite
she
said
pierre
pointing
the
stately
beauty
she
glided
away
and
how
she
carries
herself
for
young
girl
such
tact
such
masterly
perfection
manner
comes
from
her
heart
happy
the
man
who
wins
her
with
her
the
least
worldly
men
would
occupy
most
brilliant
position
society
don
you
think
only
wanted
know
your
opinion
and
anna
pavlovna
let
pierre
pierre
reply
sincerely
agreed
with
her
helene
perfection
manner
ever
thought
helene
was
just
her
beauty
and
her
remarkable
skill
appearing
silently
dignified
society
the
old
aunt
received
the
two
young
people
her
corner
but
seemed
desirous
hiding
her
adoration
for
helene
and
inclined
rather
show
her
fear
anna
pavlovna
she
looked
her
niece
inquiring
what
she
was
with
these
people
leaving
them
anna
pavlovna
again
touched
pierre
sleeve
saying
hope
you
won
say
that
dull
house
again
and
she
glanced
helene
helene
smiled
with
look
implying
that
she
did
not
admit
the
possibility
anyone
seeing
her
without
being
enchanted
the
aunt
coughed
swallowed
and
said
french
that
she
was
very
pleased
see
helene
then
she
turned
pierre
with
the
same
words
welcome
and
the
same
look
the
middle
dull
and
halting
conversation
helene
turned
pierre
with
the
beautiful
bright
smile
that
she
gave
everyone
pierre
was
used
that
smile
and
had
little
meaning
for
him
that
paid
attention
the
aunt
was
just
speaking
collection
snuffboxes
that
had
belonged
pierre
father
count
bezukhov
and
showed
them
her
own
box
princess
helene
asked
see
the
portrait
the
aunt
husband
the
box
lid
that
probably
the
work
vinesse
said
pierre
mentioning
celebrated
miniaturist
and
leaned
over
the
table
take
the
snuffbox
while
trying
hear
what
was
being
said
the
other
table
half
rose
meaning
round
but
the
aunt
handed
him
the
snuffbox
passing
across
helene
back
helene
stooped
forward
make
room
and
looked
round
with
smile
she
was
always
evening
parties
wearing
dress
such
was
then
fashionable
cut
very
low
front
and
back
her
bust
which
had
always
seemed
like
marble
pierre
was
close
him
that
his
shortsighted
eyes
could
not
but
perceive
the
living
charm
her
neck
and
shoulders
near
his
lips
that
need
only
have
bent
his
head
little
have
touched
them
was
conscious
the
warmth
her
body
the
scent
perfume
and
the
creaking
her
corset
she
moved
did
not
see
her
marble
beauty
forming
complete
whole
with
her
dress
but
all
the
charm
her
body
only
covered
her
garments
and
having
once
seen
this
could
not
help
being
aware
just
cannot
renew
illusion
have
once
seen
through
you
have
never
noticed
before
how
beautiful
helene
seemed
say
you
had
not
noticed
that
woman
yes
woman
who
may
belong
anyone
you
too
said
her
glance
and
that
moment
pierre
felt
that
helene
not
only
could
but
must
his
wife
and
that
could
not
otherwise
knew
this
that
moment
surely
had
been
standing
the
altar
with
her
how
and
when
this
would
did
not
know
did
not
even
know
would
good
thing
even
felt
knew
not
why
that
would
bad
thing
but
knew
would
happen
pierre
dropped
his
eyes
lifted
them
again
and
wished
once
more
see
her
distant
beauty
far
removed
from
him
had
seen
her
every
day
until
then
but
could
longer
could
not
any
more
than
man
who
has
been
looking
tuft
steppe
grass
through
the
mist
and
taking
for
tree
can
again
take
for
tree
after
has
once
recognized
tuft
grass
she
was
terribly
close
him
she
already
had
power
over
him
and
between
them
there
was
longer
any
barrier
except
the
barrier
his
own
will
well
will
leave
you
your
little
corner
came
anna
pavlovna
voice
see
you
are
all
right
there
and
pierre
anxiously
trying
remember
whether
had
done
anything
reprehensible
looked
round
with
blush
seemed
him
that
everyone
knew
what
had
happened
him
knew
himself
little
later
when
went
the
large
circle
anna
pavlovna
said
him
hear
you
are
refitting
your
petersburg
house
this
was
true
the
architect
had
told
him
that
was
necessary
and
pierre
without
knowing
why
was
having
his
enormous
petersburg
house
done
that
good
thing
but
don
move
from
prince
vasili
good
have
friend
like
the
prince
she
said
smiling
prince
vasili

something
about
that
don
and
you
are
still
young
you
need
advice
don
angry
with
for
exercising
old
woman
privilege
she
paused
women
always
expecting
something
after
they
have
mentioned
their
age
you
marry
will
different
thing
she
continued
uniting
them
both
one
glance
pierre
did
not
look
helene
nor
she
him
but
she
was
just
terribly
close
him
muttered
something
and
colored
when
got
home
could
not
sleep
for
long
time
for
thinking
what
had
happened
what
had
happened
nothing
had
merely
understood
that
the
woman
had
known
child
whom
when
her
beauty
was
mentioned
had
said
absent
mindedly
yes
she
good
looking
had
understood
that
this
woman
might
belong
him
but
she
stupid
have
myself
said
she
stupid
thought
there
something
nasty
something
wrong
the
feeling
she
excites
have
been
told
that
her
brother
anatole
was
love
with
her
and
she
with
him
that
there
was
quite
scandal
and
that
that
why
was
sent
away
hippolyte
her
brother
prince
vasili
her
father
bad
reflected
but
while
was
thinking
this
the
reflection
was
still
incomplete
caught
himself
smiling
and
was
conscious
that
another
line
thought
had
sprung
and
while
thinking
her
worthlessness
was
also
dreaming
how
she
would
his
wife
how
she
would
love
him
become
quite
different
and
how
all
had
thought
and
heard
her
might
false
and
again
saw
her
not
the
daughter
prince
vasili
but
visualized
her
whole
body
only
veiled
its
gray
dress
but
why
did
this
thought
never
occur
before
and
again
told
himself
that
was
impossible
that
there
would
something
unnatural
and
seemed
him
dishonorable
this
marriage
recalled
her
former
words
and
looks
and
the
words
and
looks
those
who
had
seen
them
together
recalled
anna
pavlovna
words
and
looks
when
she
spoke
him
about
his
house
recalled
thousands
such
hints
from
prince
vasili
and
others
and
was
seized
terror
lest
had
already
some
way
bound
himself
something
that
was
evidently
wrong
and
that
ought
not
but
the
very
time
was
expressing
this
conviction
himself
another
part
his
mind
her
image
rose
all
its
womanly
beauty
chapter
november
prince
vasili
had
tour
inspection
four
different
provinces
had
arranged
this
for
himself
visit
his
neglected
estates
the
same
time
and
pick
his
son
anatole
where
his
regiment
was
stationed
and
take
him
visit
prince
nicholas
bolkonski
order
arrange
match
for
him
with
the
daughter
that
rich
old
man
but
before
leaving
home
and
undertaking
these
new
affairs
prince
vasili
had
settle
matters
with
pierre
who
true
had
latterly
spent
whole
days
home
that
prince
vasili
house
where
was
staying
and
had
been
absurd
excited
and
foolish
helene
presence
lover
should
but
had
not
yet
proposed
her
this
all
very
fine
but
things
must
settled
said
prince
vasili
himself
with
sorrowful
sigh
one
morning
feeling
that
pierre
who
was
under
such
obligations
him
but
never
mind
that
was
not
behaving
very
well
this
matter
youth
frivolity
well
god
with
him
thought
relishing
his
own
goodness
heart
but
must
brought
head
the
day
after
tomorrow
will
lelya
name
day
will
invite
two
three
people
and
does
not
understand
what
ought
then
will
affair
yes
affair
her
father
six
weeks
after
anna
pavlovna
home
and
after
the
sleepless
night
when
had
decided
that
marry
helene
would
calamity
and
that
ought
avoid
her
and
away
pierre
despite
that
decision
had
not
left
prince
vasili
and
felt
with
terror
that
people
eyes
was
every
day
more
and
more
connected
with
her
that
was
impossible
for
him
return
his
former
conception
her
that
could
not
break
away
from
her
and
that
though
would
terrible
thing
would
have
unite
his
fate
with
hers
might
perhaps
have
been
able
free
himself
but
that
prince
vasili
who
had
rarely
before
given
receptions
now
hardly
let
day
without
having
evening
party
which
pierre
had
present
unless
wished
spoil
the
general
pleasure
and
disappoint
everyone
expectation
prince
vasili
the
rare
moments
when
was
home
would
take
pierre
hand
passing
and
draw
downwards
absent
mindedly
hold
out
his
wrinkled
clean
shaven
cheek
for
pierre
kiss
and
would
say
till
tomorrow
dinner
shall
not
see
you
staying
for
your
sake
and
and
though
prince
vasili
when
stayed
said
for
pierre
sake
hardly
exchanged
couple
words
with
him
pierre
felt
unable
disappoint
him
every
day
said
himself
one
and
the
same
thing
time
understood
her
and
made
mind
what
she
really
was
mistaken
before
mistaken
now
she
not
stupid
she
excellent
girl
sometimes
said
himself
she
never
makes
mistake
never
says
anything
stupid
she
says
little
but
what
she
does
say
always
clear
and
simple
she
not
stupid
she
never
was
abashed
and
not
abashed
now
she
cannot
bad
woman
had
often
begun
make
reflections
think
aloud
her
company
and
she
had
always
answered
him
either
brief
but
appropriate
remark
showing
that
did
not
interest
her
silent
look
and
smile
which
more
palpably
than
anything
else
showed
pierre
her
superiority
she
was
right
regarding
all
arguments
nonsense
comparison
with
that
smile
she
always
addressed
him
with
radiantly
confiding
smile
meant
for
him
alone
which
there
was
something
more
significant
than
the
general
smile
that
usually
brightened
her
face
pierre
knew
that
everyone
was
waiting
for
him
say
word
and
cross
certain
line
and
knew
that
sooner
later
would
step
across
but
incomprehensible
terror
seized
him
the
thought
that
dreadful
step
thousand
times
during
that
month
and
half
while
felt
himself
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
that
dreadful
abyss
pierre
said
himself
what
doing
need
resolution
can
that
have
none
wished
take
decision
but
felt
with
dismay
that
this
matter
lacked
that
strength
will
which
had
known
himself
and
really
possessed
pierre
was
one
those
who
are
only
strong
when
they
feel
themselves
quite
innocent
and
since
that
day
when
was
overpowered
feeling
desire
while
stooping
over
the
snuffbox

unacknowledged

the
guilt

conversations

that

attracted
everybody
attention
with
facetious
smile
his
face
was
telling
the

about
last
wednesday
meeting
the
imperial
council
which
sergey
kuzmich
vyazmitinov
the
new
military
governor
general
petersburg
had
received
and
read
the
then
famous
rescript
the
emperor
alexander
from
the
army
sergey
kuzmich
which
the
emperor
said
that
was
receiving
from
all
sides
declarations
the
people
loyalty
that
the
declaration
from
petersburg
gave
him
particular
pleasure
and
that
was
proud
the
head
such
nation
and
would
endeavor
worthy
this
rescript
began
with
the
words
sergey
kuzmich
from
all
sides
reports
reach
etc
well
and
never
got
farther
than
sergey
kuzmich
asked
one
the
ladies
exactly
not
hair
breadth
farther
answered
prince
vasili
laughing
sergey
kuzmich
from
all
sides
from
all
sides
sergey
kuzmich
poor
vyazmitinov
could
not
get
any
farther
began
the
rescript
again
and
again
but
soon
uttered
sergey
sobbed
kuz
tears
and
from
all
sides
was
smothered
sobs
and
could
get
farther
and
again
his
handkerchief
and
again
sergey
kuzmich
from
all
sides
and
tears
till
last
somebody
else
was
asked
read
kuzmich
from
all
sides
and
then
tears
someone
repeated
laughing
don
unkind
cried
anna
pavlovna
from
her
end
the
table
holding
threatening
finger
such
worthy
and
excellent
man
our
dear
vyazmitinov
everybody
laughed
great
deal
the
head
the
table
where
the
honored
guests
sat
everyone
seemed
high
spirits
and
under
the
influence
variety
exciting
sensations
only
pierre
and
helene
sat
silently
side
side
almost
the
bottom
the
table
suppressed
smile
brightening
both
their
faces
smile
that
had
nothing
with
sergey
kuzmich
smile
bashfulness
their
own
feelings
but
much
all
the
rest
laughed
talked
and
joked
much
they
enjoyed
their
rhine
wine
saute
and
ices
and
however
they
avoided
looking
the
young
couple
and
heedless
and
unobservant
they
seemed
them
one
could
feel
the
occasional
glances
they
gave
that
the
story
about
sergey
kuzmich
the
laughter
and
the
food
were
all
pretense
and
that
the
whole
attention
that
company
was
directed
pierre
and
helene
prince
vasili
mimicked
the
sobbing
sergey
kuzmich
and
the
same
time
his
eyes
glanced
toward
his
daughter
and
while
laughed
the
expression
his
face
clearly
said
yes
getting
will
all
settled
today
anna
pavlovna
threatened
him
behalf
our
dear
vyazmitinov
and
her
eyes
which
for
instant
glanced
pierre
prince
vasili
read
congratulation
his
future
son
law
and
his
daughter
happiness
the
old
princess
sighed
sadly
she
offered
some
wine
the
old
lady
next
her
and
glanced
angrily
her
daughter
and
her
sigh
seemed
say
yes
there
nothing
left
for
you
and
but
sip
sweet
wine
dear
now
that
the
time
has
come
for
these
young
ones
thus
boldly
provocatively
happy
and
what
nonsense
all
this
that
saying
thought
diplomatist
glancing
the
happy
faces
the
lovers
that
happiness
into
the
insignificant
trifling
and
artificial
interests
uniting
that
society
had
entered
the
simple
feeling
the
attraction
healthy
and
handsome
young
man
and
woman
for
one
another
and
this
human
feeling
dominated
everything
else
and
soared
above
all
their
affected
chatter
jests
fell
flat
news
was
not
interesting
and
the
animation
was
evidently
forced
not
only
the
guests
but
even
the
footmen
waiting
table
seemed
feel
this
and
they
forgot
their
duties
they
looked
the
beautiful
helene
with
her
radiant
face
and
the
red
broad
and
happy
though
uneasy
face
pierre
seemed
the
very
light
the
candles
was
focused
those
two
happy
faces
alone
pierre
felt
that
was
the
center
all
and
this
both
pleased
and
embarrassed
him
was
like
man
entirely
absorbed
some
occupation
did
not
see
hear
understand
anything
clearly
only
now
and
then
detached
ideas
and
impressions
from
the
world
reality
shot
unexpectedly
through
his
mind
all
finished
thought
and
how
has
all
happened
how
quickly
now
know
that
not
because
her
alone
nor
myself
alone
but
because
everyone
must
inevitably
come
about
they
are
all
expecting
they
are
sure
that
will
happen
that
cannot
cannot
disappoint
them
but
how
will
not
know
but
will
certainly
happen
thought
pierre
glancing
those
dazzling
shoulders
close
his
eyes
would
suddenly
feel
ashamed
knew
not
what
felt
awkward
attract
everyone
attention
and
considered
lucky
man
and
with
his
plain
face
looked
sort
paris
possessed
helen
but
doubt
always
and
must
consoled
himself
and
besides
what
have
done
bring
about
how
did
begin
traveled
from
moscow
with
prince
vasili
then
there
was
nothing
why
should
not
stay
his
house
then
played
cards
with
her
and
picked
her
reticule
and
drove
out
with
her
how
did
begin
when
did
all
come
about
and
here
was
sitting
her
side
her
betrothed
seeing
hearing
feeling
her
nearness
her
breathing
her
movements
her
beauty
then
would
suddenly
seem
him
that
was
not
she
but
was
unusually
beautiful
and
that
that
was
why
they
all
looked
him
and
flattered
this
general
admiration
would
expand
his
chest
raise
his
head
and
rejoice
his
good
fortune
suddenly
heard
familiar
voice
repeating
something
him
second
time
but
pierre
was
absorbed
that
did
not
understand
what
was
said
asking
you
when
you
last
heard
from
bolkonski
repeated
prince
vasili
third
time
how
absent
minded
you
are
dear
fellow
prince
vasili
smiled
and
pierre
noticed
that
everyone
was
smiling
him
and
helene
well
what
you
all
know
thought
pierre
what
the
truth
and
himself
smiled
his
gentle
childlike
smile
and
helene
smiled
too
when
did
you
get
the
letter
was
from
olmutz
repeated
prince
vasili
who
pretended
want
know
this
order
settle
dispute
how
can
one
talk
think
such
trifles
thought
pierre
yes
from
olmutz
answered
with
sigh
after
supper
pierre
with
his
partner
followed
the
others
into
the
drawing
room
the
guests
began
disperse
some
without
taking
leave
helene
some
unwilling
distract
her
from
important
occupation
came
her
for
moment
and
made
haste
away
refusing
let
her
see
them
off
the
diplomatist
preserved
mournful
silence
left
the
drawing
room
pictured
the
vanity
his
diplomatic
career
comparison
with
pierre
happiness
the
old
general
grumbled
his
wife
when
she
asked
how
his
leg
was
the
old
fool
thought
that
princess
helene
will
beautiful
still
when
she
fifty
think
may
congratulate
you
whispered
anna
pavlovna
the
old
princess
kissing
her
soundly
hadn
this
headache
have
stayed
longer
the
old
princess
did
not
reply
she
was
tormented
jealousy
her
daughter
happiness
while
the
guests
were
taking
their
leave
pierre
remained
for
long
time
alone
with
helene
the
little
drawing
room
where
they
were
sitting
had
often
before
during
the
last
six
weeks
remained
alone
with
her
but
had
never
spoken
her
love
now
felt
that
was
inevitable
but
could
not
make
his
mind
take
the
final
step
felt
ashamed
felt
that
was
occupying
someone
else
place
here
beside
helene
this
happiness
not
for
you
some
inner
voice
whispered
him
this
happiness
for
those
who
have
not
them
what
there
you
but
had
say
something
began
asking
her
whether
she
was
satisfied
with
the
party
she
replied
her
usual
simple
manner
that
this
name
day
hers
had
been
one
the
pleasantest
she
had
ever
had
some
the
nearest
relatives
had
not
yet
left
they
were
sitting
the
large
drawing
room
prince
vasili
came
pierre
with
languid
footsteps
pierre
rose
and
said
was
getting
late
prince
vasili
gave
him
look
stern
inquiry
though
what
pierre
had
just
said
was
strange
that
one
could
not
take
but
then
the
expression
severity
changed
and
drew
pierre
hand
downwards
made
him
sit
down
and
smiled
affectionately
well
lelya
asked
turning
instantly
his
daughter
and
addressing
her
with
the
careless
tone
habitual
tenderness
natural
parents
who
have
petted
their
children
from
babyhood
but
which
prince
vasili
had
only
acquired
imitating
other
parents
and
again
turned
pierre
sergey
kuzmich
from
all
sides
said
unbuttoning
the
top
button
his
waistcoat
pierre
smiled
but
his
smile
showed
that
knew
was
not
the
story
about
sergey
kuzmich
that
interested
prince
vasili
just
then
and
prince
vasili
saw
that
pierre
knew
this
suddenly
muttered
something
and
went
away
seemed
pierre
that
even
the
prince
was
disconcerted
the
sight
the
discomposure
that
old
man
the
world
touched
pierre
looked
helene
and
she
too
seemed
disconcerted
and
her
look
seemed
say
well
your
own
fault
the
step
must
taken
but
cannot
cannot
thought
pierre
and
again
began
speaking
about
indifferent
matters
about
sergey
kuzmich
asking
what
the
point
the
story
was
had
not
heard
properly
helene
answered
with
smile
that
she
too
had
missed
when
prince
vasili
returned
the
drawing
room
the
princess
his
wife
was
talking
low
tones
the
elderly
lady
about
pierre
course
very
brilliant
match
but
happiness
dear
marriages
are
made
heaven
replied
the
elderly
lady
prince
vasili
passed
seeming
not
hear
the
ladies
and
sat
down
sofa
far
corner
the
room
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
dozing
his
head
sank
forward
and
then
roused
himself
aline
said
his
wife
and
see
what
they
are
about
the
princess
went
the
door
passed
with
dignified
and
indifferent
air
and
glanced
into
the
little
drawing
room
pierre
and
helene
still
sat
talking
just
before
still
the
same
she
said
her
husband
prince
vasili
frowned
twisting
his
mouth
his
cheeks
quivered
and
his
face
assumed
the
coarse
unpleasant
expression
peculiar
him
shaking
himself
rose
threw
back
his
head
and
with
resolute
steps
went
past
the
ladies
into
the
little
drawing
room
with
quick
steps
went
joyfully
pierre
his
face
was
unusually
triumphant
that
pierre
rose
alarm
seeing
thank
god
said
prince
vasili
wife
has
told
everything
put
one
arm
around
pierre
and
the
other
around

daughter

boy
lelya
very
pleased
his
voice
trembled
loved
your
father
and
she
will
make
you
good
wife
god
bless
you
embraced
his
daughter
and
then
again
pierre
and
kissed
him
with
his
malodorous
mouth
tears
actually
moistened
his
cheeks
princess

here
shouted
the
old
princess
came
and
also
wept
the
elderly
lady
was
using
her
handkerchief
too
pierre
was
kissed
and
kissed
the
beautiful
helene
hand
several
times
after
while
they
were
left
alone
again
all
this
had
and
could
not
otherwise
thought
pierre
useless
ask
whether
good
bad
good
because
definite
and
one
rid
the
old
tormenting
doubt
pierre
held

incautiously
remarked
the
little
princess
hearing
the
news
prince

frowned
but
said
nothing
fortnight
after
the
letter
prince
vasili
servants
came
one
evening
advance
him
and
and
his
son
arrived
next
day
old
bolkonski
had
always
had
poor
opinion
prince
vasili
character
but
more
recently
since
the
new
reigns
paul
and
alexander
prince
vasili
had
risen
high
position
and
honors
and
now
from
the
hints
contained
his
letter
and
given
the
little
princess
saw
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
and
his
low
opinion
changed
into
feeling
contemptuous
ill
will
snorted
whenever
mentioned
him
the
day
prince
vasili
arrival
prince
bolkonski
was
particularly
discontented
and
out
temper
whether
was
bad
temper
because
prince
vasili
was
coming
whether
his
being
bad
temper
made
him
specially
annoyed
prince
vasili
visit
was
bad
temper
and
the
morning
tikhon
had
already
advised
the
architect
not
the
prince
with
his
report
you
hear
how
walking
said
tikhon
drawing
the
architect
attention
the
sound
the
prince
footsteps
stepping
flat
his
heels
know
what
that
means
however
nine
clock
the
prince
his
velvet
coat
with
sable
collar
and
cap
went
out
for
his
usual
walk
had
snowed
the
day
before
and
the
path
the
hothouse
along
which
the
prince
was
the
habit
walking
had
been
swept
the
marks
the
broom
were
still
visible
the
snow
and
shovel
had
been
left
sticking
one
the
soft
snowbanks
that
bordered
both
sides
the
path
the
prince
went
through
the
conservatories
the
serfs
quarters
and
the
outbuildings
frowning
and
silent
can
sleigh
pass
asked
his
overseer
venerable
man
resembling
his
master
manners
and
looks
who
was
accompanying
him
back
the
house
the
snow
deep
having
the
avenue
swept
your
honor
the
prince
bowed
his
head
and
went
the
porch
god
thanked
thought
the
overseer
the
storm
has
blown
over
would
have
been
hard
drive
your
honor
added
heard
your
honor
that
minister
coming
visit
your
honor
the
prince
turned
round
the
overseer
and
fixed
his
eyes
him
frowning
what
minister
what
minister
who
gave
orders
said
his
shrill
harsh
voice
the
road
not
swept
for
the
princess
daughter
but
for
minister
for
there
are
ministers
your
honor
thought
you
thought
shouted
the
prince
his
words
coming
more
and
more
rapidly
and
indistinctly
you
thought
rascals
blackguards
teach
you
think
and
lifting
his
stick
swung
and
would
have
hit
alpatych
the
overseer
had
not
the
latter
instinctively
avoided
the
blow
thought
blackguards
shouted
the
prince
rapidly
but
although
alpatych
frightened
his
own
temerity
avoiding
the
stroke
came
the
prince
bowing
his
bald
head
resignedly
before
him
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
the
prince
though
continued
shout
blackguards
throw
the
snow
back
the
road
did
not
lift
his
stick
again
but
hurried
into
the
house
before
dinner
princess
mary
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
who
knew
that
the
prince
was
bad
humor
stood
awaiting
him
mademoiselle
bourienne
with
radiant
face
that
said
know
nothing
the
same
usual
and
princess
mary
pale
frightened
and
with
downcast
eyes
what
she
found
hardest
bear
was
know
that
such
occasions
she
ought
behave
like
mademoiselle
bourienne
but
could
not
she
thought
seem
not

will
think
that
not

myself
will

the

lived

with
sense
antipathy
the

she
did
not
realize
because
the
fear
was
much
the
stronger
feeling
the
prince
reciprocated
this
antipathy
but
was
overpowered
his
contempt
for
her
when

smilingly
and
absent
mindedly
fixed
his
large
and
handsome
eyes
regarded
his
whole

continual
round
amusement
which
someone
for
some
reason
had
provide
for
him
and
looked

visit
churlish
old
man
and
rich
and
ugly
heiress
the

well
and
amusingly

much
money
that
never
does
any
harm

anatole
shaved
and
scented
himself
with
the
care
and
elegance
which
had
become
habitual

his
handsome
head
held
high

apart
she
very
hideous
anatole
asked

that
the

and
his

had
arrived
but
the
appearance
both
had
been
minutely
described
princess

was
sitting
alone
her
room
vainly
trying
master
her
agitation

she
said
looking
herself
the
glass
how
shall
enter
the
drawing
room
even
like
him
can
now
myself
with
him
the
mere
thought
her
father
look
filled
her
with
terror
the
little
princess
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
had
already
received
from
masha
the
lady
maid
the
necessary
report
how
handsome
the
minister
son
was
with
his
rosy
cheeks
and
dark
eyebrows
and
with
what
difficulty
the
father
had
dragged
his
legs
upstairs
while
the
son
had
followed
him
like
eagle
three
steps
time
having
received
this
information
the
little
princess
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
whose
chattering
voices
had
reached
her
from
the
corridor
went
into
princess
mary
room

know
they
come

said
the
little
princess
waddling
and
sinking
heavily
into
armchair
she
was
longer
the
loose
gown
she
generally
wore
the
morning
but
had
one
her
best
dresses
her
hair
was
carefully
done
and
her
face
was
animated
which
however
did
not
conceal
its
sunken
and
faded
outlines
dressed
she
used
petersburg
society
was
still
more
noticeable
how
much
plainer
she
had
become
some
unobtrusive
touch
had
been
added
mademoiselle
bourienne
toilet
which
rendered
her
fresh
and
pretty
face
yet
more
attractive
what
are

going

dear
princess
she
began
they
announcing
that
the
gentlemen
are
the
drawing
room
and

have
down
and
you
have
not
smartened
yourself
all
the
little
princess
got
rang
for
the
maid
and
hurriedly
and
merrily
began
devise
and
carry
out
plan
how
princess
mary
should
dressed
princess
mary
self
esteem
was
wounded
the
fact
that
the
arrival
suitor
agitated
her
and
still
more
both
her
companions
not
having
the
least
conception
that
could
otherwise
tell
them
that
she
felt
ashamed
for
herself
and
for
them
would
betray
her
agitation
while
decline
their
offers

her
would
prolong
their
banter
and
insistence
she
flushed
her
beautiful
eyes
grew
dim
red
blotches
came
her
face
and
took
the
unattractive
martyrlike
expression
often
wore
she
submitted
herself
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
lise
both
these
women
quite
sincerely
tried
make
her
look
pretty
she
was
plain
that
neither
them
could
think
her
rival
they
began
dressing
her
with
perfect
sincerity
and
with
the
naive
and
firm
conviction
women
have
that
dress
can
make
face
pretty
really
dear
this
dress
not
pretty
said
lise
looking
sideways
princess
mary
from
little
distance
you
have
maroon
dress
have
fetched
really
you
know
the
fate
your
whole
life
may
stake
but
this
one
too
light
not
becoming
was
not
the
dress
but
the
face
and
whole
figure
princess
mary
that
was
not
pretty
but
neither
mademoiselle
bourienne
nor
the
little
princess
felt
this
they
still
thought
that
blue
ribbon
were
placed
the
hair
the
hair
combed
and
the
blue
scarf
arranged
lower
the
best
maroon
dress
and
all
would
well
they
forgot
that
the
frightened
face
and
the
figure
could
not
altered
and
that
however
they
might
change
the
setting
and
adornment
that
face
would
still
remain
piteous
and
plain
after
two
three
changes
which
princess
mary
meekly
submitted
just
her
hair
had
been
arranged
the
top
her
head
style
that
quite
altered
and
spoiled
her
looks
and
she
had
put
maroon
dress
with
pale
blue
scarf
the
little
princess
walked
twice
round
her
now
adjusting
fold
the
dress
with
her
little
hand
now
arranging
the
scarf
and
looking
her
with
her
head
bent
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
will
not
she
said
decidedly
clasping
her
hands
mary
really
this
dress
does
not
suit
you
prefer
you
your
little
gray
everyday
dress
now
please
for
sake
katie
she
said
the
maid
bring
the
princess
her
gray
dress
and
you
see
mademoiselle
bourienne
how
shall
arrange
she
added
smiling
with
foretaste
artistic
pleasure
but
when
katie
brought
the
required
dress
princess
mary
remained
sitting
motionless
before
the
glass
looking
her
face
and
saw
the
mirror
her
eyes
full
tears
and
her
mouth
quivering
ready
burst
into
sobs
come
dear
princess
said
mademoiselle
bourienne
just
one
more
little
effort
the
little
princess
taking
the
dress
from
the
maid
came
princess
mary
well
now
arrange
something
quite
simple
and
becoming
she
said
the
three
voices
hers
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
katie
who
was
laughing
something
mingled
merry
sound
like
the
chirping
birds
leave
alone
said
princess
mary
her
voice
sounded
serious
and
sad
that
the
chirping
the
birds
was
silenced
once
they
looked
the
beautiful
large
thoughtful
eyes
full
tears
and
thoughts
gazing
shiningly
and
imploringly
them
and
understood
that
was
useless
and
even
cruel
insist
least
change
your
coiffure
said
the
little
princess
didn
tell
you
she
went
turning
reproachfully
mademoiselle
bourienne
mary
face
which
such
coiffure
does
not
suit
the
least
not
the
least
please
change
leave
alone
please
leave
alone
all
quite
the
same
answered
voice
struggling
with
tears
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
the
little
princess
had
own
themselves
that
princess
mary
this
guise
looked
very
plain
worse
than
usual
but
was
too
late
she
was
looking
them
with
expression
they
both
knew
expression
thoughtful
and
sad
this
expression
princess
mary
did
not
frighten
them
she
never
inspired
fear
anyone
but
they
knew
that
when
appeared
her
face
she
became
mute
and
was
not
shaken
her
determination
you
will
change
won
you
said
lise
and
princess
mary
gave
answer
she
left
the
room
princess
mary
was
left
alone
she
did
not
comply
with
lise
request
she
not
only
left
her
hair

but
did
not
even
look
her
glass

her
arms
fall
helplessly

sat
with
downcast
eyes
and
pondered

out
moment
came
the
maid

the
door
she
roused
herself
and
felt
appalled
what
she
had
been
thinking
and
before
going
down
she
went
into
the
room
where
the
icons
hung
and
her
eyes
fixed

dreamed

her

most
deeply

was
for

the

she
tried

fulfillment
her
forbidden
earthly
longing
princess
mary
sighed
and
having
crossed
herself
went
down
thinking
neither
her
gown
and
coiffure
nor
how
she
would
nor
what
she
would
say
what
could
all
that
matter

with
the

chapter
when
princess
mary
came
down
prince
vasili
and
his
son
were
already
the
drawing
room
talking
the
little
princess
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
when
she
entered
with
her
heavy
step
treading
her
heels
the
gentlemen
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
rose
and
the
little
princess
indicating
her
the
gentlemen
said
voila
marie
princess
mary
saw
them
all
and
saw
them
detail
she
saw
prince
vasili
face
serious
for
instant
the
sight
her
but
immediately
smiling
again
and
the
little
princess
curiously
noting
the
impression
marie
produced
the
visitors
and
she
saw
mademoiselle
bourienne
with
her
ribbon
and
pretty
face
and
her
unusually
animated
look
which
was
fixed
him
but
him
she
could
not
see
she
only
saw
something
large
brilliant
and
handsome
moving
toward
her
she
entered
the
room
prince
vasili
approached
first
and
she
kissed
the
bold
forehead
that
bent
over
her
hand
and
answered
his
question
saying
that
the
contrary
she
remembered
him
quite
well
then
anatole
came
her
she
still
could
not
see
him
she
only
felt
soft
hand
taking
hers
firmly
and
she
touched
with
her
lips
white
forehead
over
which
was
beautiful
light
brown
hair
smelling
pomade
when
she
looked
him
she
was
struck
his
beauty
anatole
stood
with
his
right
thumb
under
button
his
uniform
his
chest
expanded
and
his
back
drawn
slightly
swinging
one
foot
and
with
his
head
little
bent
looked
with
beaming
face
the
princess
without
speaking
and
evidently
not
thinking
about
her
all
anatole
was
not
quick
witted
nor
ready
eloquent
conversation
but
had
the
faculty
invaluable
society
composure
and
imperturbable
self
possession
man
lacking
self
confidence
remains
dumb
first
introduction
and
betrays
consciousness
the
impropriety
such
silence
and
anxiety
find
something
say
the
effect
bad
but
anatole
was
dumb
swung
his
foot
and
smilingly
examined
the
princess
hair
was
evident
that
could
silent
this
way
for
very
long
time
anyone
finds
this
silence
inconvenient
let
him
talk
but
don
want
seemed
say
besides
this
his
behavior
women
anatole
had
manner
which
particularly
inspires
them
curiosity
awe
and
even
love
supercilious
consciousness
his
own
superiority
was
said
them
know
you
know
you
but
why
should
bother
about
you
you
only
too
glad
course
perhaps
did
not
really
think
this
when
met
women
even
probably
did
not
for
general
thought
very
little
but
his
looks
and
manner
gave
that
impression
the
princess
felt
this
and
wishing
show
him
that
she
did
not
even
dare
expect
interest
him
she
turned
his
father
the
conversation
was
general
and
animated
thanks
princess
lise
voice
and
little
downy
lip
that
lifted
over
her
white
teeth
she
met
prince
vasili
with
that
playful
manner
often
employed
lively
chatty
people
and
consisting
the
assumption
that
between
the
person
they
address
and
themselves
there
are
some
semi
private
long
established
jokes
and
amusing
reminiscences
though
such
reminiscences
really
exist
just
none
existed
this
case
prince
vasili
readily
adopted
her
tone
and
the
little
princess
also
drew
anatole
whom
she
hardly
knew
into
these
amusing
recollections
things
that
had
never
occurred
mademoiselle
bourienne
also
shared
them
and
even
princess
mary
felt
herself
pleasantly
made
share
these
merry
reminiscences
here
least
shall
have
the
benefit
your
company
all
ourselves
dear
prince
said
the
little
princess
course
french
prince
vasili
not
annette
receptions
where
you
always
ran
away
you
remember
cette
chere
annette
anna
pavlovna
but
you
won
talk
politics
like
annette
and
our
little
tea
table
yes
why
you
were
never
annette
the
little
princess
asked
anatole
know
know
she
said
with
sly
glance
your
brother
hippolyte
told
about
your
goings
and
she
shook
her
finger
him
have
even
heard
your
doings
paris
and
didn
hippolyte
tell
you
asked
prince
vasili
turning
his
son
and
seizing
the
little
princess
arm
she
would
have
run
away
and
had
just
managed
catch
her
didn
tell
you
how
himself
was
pining
for
the
dear
princess
and
how
she
showed
him
the
door
she
pearl
among
women
princess
added
turning
princess
mary
when
paris
was
mentioned
mademoiselle
bourienne
for
her
part
seized
the
opportunity
joining
the
general
current
recollections
she
took
the
liberty
inquiring
whether
was
long
since
anatole
had
left
paris
and
how
had
liked
that
city
anatole
answered
the
frenchwoman
very
readily
and
looking
her
with
smile
talked
her
about
her
native
land
when
saw
the
pretty
little
bourienne
anatole
came
the
conclusion
that
would
not
find
bald
hills
dull
either
not
all
bad
thought
examining
her
not
all
bad
that
little
companion
hope
she
will
bring
her
along
with
her
when
married
petite
est
gentille
the
little
one
charming
the
old
prince
dressed
leisurely
his
study
frowning
and
considering
what
was
the
coming
these
visitors
annoyed
him
what
are
prince
vasili
and
that
son
his
prince
vasili
shallow
braggart
and
his
son
doubt
fine
specimen
grumbled
himself
what
angered
him
was
that
the
coming
these
visitors
revived
his
mind
unsettled
question
always
tried
stifle
one
about
which
always
deceived
himself
the
question
was
whether
could
ever
bring
himself
part
from
his
daughter
and
give
her
husband
the
prince
never
directly
asked
himself
that
question
knowing
beforehand
that
would
have
answer
justly
and
justice
clashed
not
only
with
his
feelings
but
with
the
very
possibility
life
life
without
princess
mary
little
seemed
value
her
was
unthinkable
him
and
why
should
she
marry
thought
unhappy
for
certain
there
lise
married
andrew
better
husband
one
would
think
could
hardly
found
nowadays
but
she
contented
with
her
lot
and
who
would
marry
marie
for
love
plain
and
awkward
they
take
her
for
her
connections
and
wealth
are
there
women
living
unmarried
and
even
the
happier
for
thought
prince
bolkonski
while
dressing
and
yet
the
question
was
always
putting
off
demanded
immediate
answer
prince
vasili
had
brought
his
son
with
the
evident
intention
proposing
and
today
tomorrow
would
probably
ask
for
answer
his
birth
and
position
society
were
not
bad
well
nothing
against
the
prince
said
himself
but
must
worthy

that
what

added
aloud
entered
the
drawing

curiosity
and
perfect
composure
waiting
for

the
eccentricities

prince
bolkonski
sat
down
his

place
the
corner
the
sofa
and
drawing
armchair
for
prince

pointed
and
began
questioning
him
about
political

attentively

said
but
kept
glancing

bolkonski
bowing
his

and
sat
down
again
paying
more
attention
his

was

beside
the

announced
his
hopes
and
wishes
the
old
prince

said
the

angrily
what

and
see
the

all
the
same
screamed
the
same
piercing
tone
when
parting
from
his
son
will
tell
you
frankly
said
prince
vasili
the
tone
crafty
man
convinced
the
futility
being
cunning
with
keen
sighted
companion
you
know
you
see
right
through
people
anatole
genius
but
honest
goodhearted
lad
excellent
son
kinsman
all
right
all
right
see
always
happens
when
women
lead
lonely
lives
for
any
length
time
without
male
society
anatole
appearance
all
the
three
women
prince
bolkonski
household
felt
that
their
life
had
not
been
real
till
then
their
powers
reasoning
feeling
and
observing
immediately
increased
tenfold
and
their
life
which
seemed
have
been
passed
darkness
was
suddenly
lit
new
brightness
full
significance
princess
mary
grew
quite
unconscious
her
face
and
coiffure
the
handsome
open
face
the
man
who
might
perhaps
her
husband
absorbed
all
her
attention
seemed
her
kind
brave
determined
manly
and
magnanimous
she
felt
convinced
that
thousands
dreams
future
family
life
continually
rose
her
imagination
she
drove
them
away
and
tried
conceal
them
but
not
too
cold
with
him
thought
the
princess
try
reserved
because
the
depth
soul
feel
too
near
him
already
but
then
cannot
know
what
think
him
and
may
imagine
that
not
like
him
and
princess
mary
tried
but
could
not
manage
cordial
her
new
guest
poor
girl
she
devilish
ugly
thought
anatole
mademoiselle
bourienne
also
roused
great
excitement
anatole
arrival
thought
another
way
course
she
handsome
young
woman
without
any
definite
position
without
relations
even
country
did
not
intend
devote
her
life
serving
prince
bolkonski
reading
aloud
him
and
being
friends
with
princess
mary
mademoiselle
bourienne
had
long
been
waiting
for
russian
prince
who
able
appreciate
glance
her
superiority
the
plain
badly
dressed
ungainly
russian
princesses
would
fall
love
with
her
and
carry
her
off
and
here
last
was
russian
prince
mademoiselle
bourienne
knew
story
heard
from
her
aunt
but
finished
her
own
way
which
she
liked
repeat
herself
was
the
story
girl
who
had
been
seduced
and
whom
her
poor
mother
pauvre
mere
appeared
and
reproached
her
for
yielding
man
without
being
married
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
often
touched
tears
imagination
she
told
this
story
him
her
seducer
and
now
real
russian
prince
had
appeared
would
carry
her
away
and
then
pauvre
mere
would
appear
and
would
marry
her
her
future
shaped
itself
mademoiselle
bourienne
head
the
very
time
she
was
talking
anatole
about
paris
was
not
calculation
that
guided
her
she
did
not
even
for
moment
consider
what
she
should
but
all
this
had
long
been
familiar
her
and
now
that
anatole
had
appeared
just
grouped
itself
around
him
and
she
wished
and
tried
please
him
much
possible
the
little
princess
like
old
war
horse
that
hears
the
trumpet
unconsciously
and
quite
forgetting
her
condition
prepared
for
the
familiar
gallop
coquetry
without
any
ulterior
motive
any
struggle
but
with
naive
and
lighthearted
gaiety
although
female
society
anatole
usually
assumed
the
role
man
tired
being
run
after
women
his
vanity
was
flattered
the
spectacle
his
power
over
these
three
women
besides
that
was
beginning
feel
for
the
pretty
and
provocative
mademoiselle
bourienne
that
passionate
animal
feeling
which
was
apt
master
him
with
great
suddenness
and
prompt
him
the
coarsest
and
most
reckless
actions
after
tea
the
company
went
into
the
sitting
room
and
princess
mary
was
asked
play
the
clavichord
anatole
laughing
and
high
spirits
came
and
leaned
his
elbows
facing
her
and
beside
mademoiselle
bourienne
princess
mary
felt
his
look
with
painfully
joyous
emotion
her
favorite
sonata
bore
her
into
most
intimately
poetic
world
and
the
look
she
felt
upon
her
made
that
world
still
more
poetic
but
anatole
expression
though
his
eyes
were
fixed
her
referred
not
her
but
the
movements
mademoiselle
bourienne
little
foot
which
was
then
touching
with
his
own
under
the
clavichord
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
also
looking
princess
mary
and
her
lovely
eyes
there
was
look
fearful
joy
and
hope
that
was
also
new
the
princess
how
she
loves
thought
princess
mary
how
happy
now
and
how
happy
may
with
such
friend
and
such
husband
husband
can
possible
she
thought
not
daring
look
his
face
but
still
feeling
his
eyes
gazing
her
the
evening
after
supper
when
all
were
about
retire
anatole
kissed
princess
mary
hand
she
did
not
know
how
she
found
the
courage
but
she
looked
straight
into
his
handsome
face
came
near
her
shortsighted
eyes
turning
from
princess
mary
went
and
kissed
mademoiselle
bourienne
hand
this
was
not
etiquette
but
then
did
everything
simply
and
with
such
assurance
mademoiselle
bourienne
flushed
and
gave
the
princess
frightened
look
what
delicacy
thought
the
princess
possible
that
amelie
mademoiselle
bourienne
thinks
could
jealous
her
and
not
value
her
pure
affection
and
devotion
she
went
her
and
kissed
her
warmly
anatole
went
kiss
the
little
princess
hand
when
your
father
writes
tell
that
you
are
behaving
well
will
give
you
hand
kiss
not
till
then
she
said
and
smilingly
raising
finger
him
she
left
the
room
chapter
they
all
separated
but
except
anatole
who
fell
asleep
soon
got
into
bed
all
kept
awake
long
time
that
night
really
husband
this
stranger
who
kind
yes
kind
that
the
chief
thing
thought
princess
mary
and
fear
which
she
had
seldom
experienced
came
upon
her
she
feared
look
round
seemed
her
that
someone
was
there
standing
behind
the
screen
the
dark
corner
and
this
someone
was
the
devil
and
was
also
this
man
with
the
white
forehead
black
eyebrows
and
red
lips
she
rang
for
her
maid
and
asked
her
sleep
her
room
mademoiselle
bourienne
walked
and
down
the
conservatory
for
long
time
that
evening
vainly
expecting
someone
now
smiling
someone
now
working
herself
tears
with
the
imaginary
words
her
pauvre
mere
rebuking
her
for
her
fall
the
little
princess
grumbled
her
maid
that
her
bed
was
badly
made
she
could
not
lie
either
her
face
her
side
every
position
was
awkward
and
uncomfortable
and
her
burden
oppressed
her
now
more
than
ever
because
anatole
presence
had
vividly
recalled
her
the
time
when
she
was
not
like
that
and
when
everything
was
light
and
gay
she
sat
armchair
her
dressing
jacket
and
nightcap
and
katie
sleepy
and
disheveled
beat
and
turned
the
heavy
feather
bed
for
the
third
time
muttering
herself
told
you
was
all
lumps
and
holes
the
little
princess
repeated
should
glad
enough
fall
asleep
not
fault
and
her
voice
quivered
like
that
child
about
cry
the
old
prince
did
not
sleep
either
tikhon
half
asleep
heard
him
pacing
angrily
about
and
snorting
the
old
prince
felt
though
had
been
insulted
through
his
daughter
the
insult
was
the
more
pointed
because
concerned
not
himself
but
another
his
daughter
whom
loved
more
than
himself
kept
telling
himself
that
would
consider
the
whole
matter
and
decide
what
was
right
and
how
should
act
but
instead
that
only
excited
himself
more
and
more
the
first
man
that
turns
she
forgets
her
father
and
everything
else
runs
upstairs
and
does
her
hair
and
wags
her
tail
and
unlike
herself
glad
throw
her
father
over
and
she
knew
should
notice
and
don
see
that
that
idiot
had
eyes
only
for
bourienne
shall
have
get
rid
her
and
how
she
has
not
pride
enough
see
she
has
pride
for
herself
she
might
least
have
some
for
sake
she
must
shown
that
the
blockhead
thinks
nothing
her
and
looks
only
bourienne
she
has
pride
but
let
her
see
the
old
prince
knew
that
told
his
daughter
she
was
making
mistake
and
that
anatole
meant
flirt
with
mademoiselle
bourienne
princess
mary
self
esteem
would
wounded
and
his
point
not
parted
from
her
would
gained
pacifying
himself
with
this
thought
called
tikhon
and
began
undress
what
devil
brought
them
here
thought
while
tikhon
was
putting
the
nightshirt
over
his
dried
old
body
and
gray
haired
chest
never
invited
them
they
came
disturb
life
and
there
not
much
left
devil
take
muttered
while
his
head
was
still
covered
the
shirt
tikhon
knew
his
master
habit
sometimes
thinking
aloud
and
therefore
met
with
unaltered
looks
the
angrily
inquisitive
expression
the
face
that
emerged
from
the
shirt
gone
bed
asked
the
prince
tikhon
like
all
good
valets
instinctively
knew
the
direction
his
master
thoughts
guessed
that
the
question
referred
prince
vasili
and
his
son
they
have
gone
bed
and
put
out
their
lights
your
excellency
good
good
said
the
prince
rapidly
and
thrusting
his
feet
into
his
slippers
and
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
his
dressing
gown
went
the
couch
which
slept
though
words
had
passed
between
anatole
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
they
quite
understood
one
another
the
first
part
their
romance
the
appearance
the
pauvre
mere
they
understood
that
they
had
much
say
one
another
private
and
they
had
been
seeking
opportunity
since
morning
meet
one
another
alone
when
princess

went

hour
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
anatole
met
the
conservatory
princess
mary
went
the
door
the
study
with
special
trepidation
seemed
her
that
not
only
did
everybody
know
that
her
fate
would
decided
that
day
but
that
they
also
knew
what
she
thought
about
she
read
this
tikhon
face
and
that
prince
vasili
valet
who
made
her
low
bow
when
she
met
him
the
corridor
carrying
hot
water
the
old
prince
was
very
affectionate
and
careful
his
treatment
his
daughter
that
morning
princess
mary
well
knew
this
painstaking
expression
her
father
his
face
wore
that
expression
when
his
dry
hands
clenched
with
vexation
her
not
understanding
sum
arithmetic
when
rising
from
his
chair
would
walk
away
from
her
repeating
low
voice
the
same
words
several
times
over
came
the
point
once

ceremoniously

with
unnatural
smile

the

saw
that
her

regarded
the
matter
with
disapproval
but
that
moment
the
thought
occurred
her
that
her
fate
would
decided
now
never
she
lowered
her
eyes
not
see
the
gaze
under
which
she
felt
that
she
could
not
think
but
would
only
able
submit
from
habit
and
she
said
wish
only
your
will
but
had
express

had
produced

shouted
when
the

staggered
out

study

fate
was
decided
and
happily
decided
but
what
her
father
had
said
about
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
dreadful
was
untrue
sure
but
still
was
terrible
and
she
could
not
help
thinking
she
was
going
straight
through
the
conservatory
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
anything
when
suddenly
the
well
known
whispering
mademoiselle
bourienne
aroused
her
she
raised
her
eyes
and
two
steps
away
saw
anatole
embracing
the
frenchwoman
and
whispering
something

with
horrified
expression

handsome
face

looked

and
ran
away

with
gay
smile
inviting
her

chapter
was
long
since
the
rostovs
had
news

not
till
midwinter
was
the

tiptoe
his

alarm
and
haste
trying
escape
notice
closed
the
door
and
began
read
the
letter
anna
mikhaylovna
who
always
knew
everything
that
passed
the
house
hearing
the
arrival
the
letter
went
softly
into
the
room
and
found
the
count
with
his
hand
sobbing
and
laughing
the
same
time
anna
mikhaylovna
though
her
circumstances
had
improved
was
still
living
with

anna
mikhaylovna
sat
down
beside
him
with
her
own
handkerchief
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
from
the
letter
then
having
dried
her
own
eyes
she
comforted
the
count
and
decided
that
dinner
and
till
teatime
she
would
prepare
the
countess
and
after
tea
with
god
help
would
inform
her
dinner
anna
mikhaylovna
talked
the
whole
time
about
the
war
news
and
about
nikolenka
twice
asked
when
the
last
letter
had
been
received
from
him
though
she
knew
that
already
and
remarked
that
they
might
very
likely
getting
letter
from
him
that
day
each
time
that
these
hints
began
make
the
countess
anxious
and
she
glanced
uneasily
the
count
and
anna
mikhaylovna
the
latter
very
adroitly
turned
the
conversation
insignificant
matters
natasha
who
the
whole
family
was
the
most
gifted
with
capacity
feel
any
shades
intonation
look
and
expression
pricked
her
ears
from
the
beginning
the
meal
and
was
certain
that
there
was
some
secret
between
her
father
and
anna
mikhaylovna
that
had
something
with
her
brother
and
that
anna
mikhaylovna
was
preparing
them
for
bold
she
was
natasha
who
knew
how
sensitive
her
mother
was
anything
relating
nikolenka
did
not
venture
ask
any
questions
dinner
but
she
was
too
excited
eat
anything
and
kept
wriggling
about
her
chair
regardless
her
governess
remarks
after
dinner
she
rushed
head
long
after
anna
mikhaylovna
and
dashing
her
flung
herself
her
neck
soon
she
overtook
her
the
sitting
room

instantly
turning

natasha
seeing

for
the
first
time
the
sorrowful
side

and
began
cry

she
through
her
tears
there
now

pacing
the
room
with
large
resolute
strides

very
glad

glad
indeed
that

distinguished
himself

sonya
but
she
said
that

all
over
and
that
now

said
sonya
crossing
herself
but
perhaps
she
deceived
you
let
mamma
petya
paced
the
room

for
time
been
nikolenka
place
would
have
killed
even
more

said
petya
you

natasha
suddenly
asked
after
moment
silence
sonya
smiled

but
you
remember
that
you

everything
said
natasha
with
expressive
gesture
evidently
wishing

her
words
very
definite
meaning
remember

she
said
but
don
remember
boris
don
remember
him
bit
what

asked

not
that
don
remember
know
what

but
not

nikolenka
him
just
shut
eyes
and
remember
but
boris
she
shut
her
eyes
there
nothing
all
natasha
said
sonya
looking
ecstatically
and
earnestly
her
friend
she
did
not
consider
her
worthy
hear
what
she
meant
say
and
she
were
saying
someone
else
with
whom
joking
was
out
the
question

with
your
brother
once
for
all
and
whatever
may
happen
him
shall
never
cease
love
him
long
live
natasha
looked
sonya
with
wondering
and
inquisitive
eyes
and
said
nothing
she
felt
that
sonya
was
speaking
the
truth
that
there
was
such
love
sonya
was
speaking
but
natasha
had
not
yet
felt
anything
like
she
believed
could
but
did
not
understand
shall
you
write
him
she
asked
sonya
became
thoughtful
the
question
how
write
nicholas
and
whether
she
ought
write
tormented
her
now
that

already
officer
and
wounded
hero
would
right
remind
him
herself
and
might
seem
the
obligations

had
taken
himself

she
said
blushing
and
you
won
feel
ashamed
write

sonya
smiled
and
should
ashamed
write
boris
not
going
why
should
you
ashamed
well

awkward
and
would
make
ashamed
and
know
why

described
his

said
the

pointing
triumphantly
the

sat
holding
one
hand
the
snuffbox
with
its
portrait
and
the
other
the
letter
and
pressing
them
alternately
her

she
again
looked
the
letter
and
the
portrait
and
order
press
them
again
her
lips
she
slightly
pushed
away
the
bald
head
vera
natasha
sonya
and
petya
now
entered
the
room
and
the
reading
the
letter
began
after
brief
description
the
campaign
and
the
two
battles
which
had
taken
part
and
his
promotion
nicholas
said
that
kissed
his
father
and
mother
hands
asking
for
their
blessing
and
that
kissed
vera
natasha
and
petya
besides
that
sent
greetings
monsieur
schelling
madame
schoss
and
his
old
nurse
and
asked
them
kiss
for
him
dear
sonya
whom
loved
and
thought
just
the
same
ever
when
she
heard
this
sonya
blushed
that
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
unable
bear
the
looks
turned
upon
her
ran
away
into
the
dancing
hall
whirled
round
full
speed
with
her
dress
puffed
out
like
balloon
and
flushed
and
smiling
plumped
down
the
floor
the
countess
was
crying
why
are
you
crying
mamma
asked
vera
from
all
says
one
should
glad
and
not
cry
this
was
quite
true
but
the
count
the
countess
and
natasha
looked
her
reproachfully
and
who
she
takes
after
thought
the
countess
nicholas
letter
was
read
over
hundreds
times
and
those
who
were
considered
worthy
hear
had
come
the
countess
for
she
did
not
let
out
her
hands
the
tutors
came
and
the
nurses
and
dmitri
and
several
acquaintances
and
the
countess
reread
the
letter
each
time
with
fresh
pleasure
and
each
time
discovered
fresh
proofs
nikolenka
virtues
how
strange
how
extraordinary
how
joyful
seemed
that
her
son
the
scarcely
perceptible
motion
whose
tiny
limbs
she
had
felt
twenty
years
ago
within
her
that
son
about
whom
she
used
have
quarrels
with
the
too
indulgent
count
that
son
who
had
first
learned
say
pear
and
then
granny
that
this
son
should
now
away
foreign
land
amid
strange
surroundings
manly
warrior
doing
some
kind
man
work
his
own
without
help
guidance
the
universal
experience
ages
showing
that
children
grow
imperceptibly
from
the
cradle
manhood
did
not
exist
for
the
countess
her
son
growth
toward
manhood
each
its
stages
had
seemed
extraordinary
her
there
had
never
existed
the
millions
human
beings
who
grew
the
same
way
twenty
years
before
seemed
impossible
that
the
little
creature
who
lived
somewhere
under
her
heart
would
ever
cry
suck
her
breast
and
begin
speak
now
she
could
not
believe
that
that
little
creature
could
this
strong
brave
man
this
model
son
and
officer
that
judging
this
letter
now
was
what
style
how
charmingly
describes
said
she
reading
the
descriptive
part
the
letter
and
what
soul
not
word
about
himself
not
word
about
some
denisov
other
though
himself
dare
say
braver
than
any
them
says
nothing
about
his
sufferings
what
heart
how
like
him
and
how
has
remembered
everybody

forgetting

and
throwing

angrily

hid
his
face
behind
the

the
devil
exclaimed
and
immediately
seizing
him
the
shoulder
and
looking
amiably
into
his
face
evidently
wishing
soften
the
rudeness
his
words
added
don
hurt

fellow

quite
understand
said
berg
getting
and
speaking
muffled
and
guttural
voice
across
our
hosts
they
invited
you
added
boris
berg
put
the
cleanest
coats
without
spot
speck
dust
stood
before
looking
glass
and
brushed
the
hair
his
temples
upwards
the
way
affected
the
emperor
alexander
and
having
assured
himself
from
the
way
rostov
looked
that
his
coat
had
been
noticed
left
the
room
with
pleasant
smile
dear
what
beast
muttered
rostov
read
the
letter
why
what
pig
not
have
written
and
have
given
them
such
fright
what
pig
repeated
flushing
suddenly
well
have
you
sent
gabriel
for
some
wine
all
right
let
have
some
the
letter
from
his
parents
was
enclosed
letter
recommendation
bagration
which
the
old
countess
anna
mikhaylovna
advice
had
obtained
through
acquaintance
and
sent
her
son
asking
him
take
its
destination
and
make
use
what
nonsense
much
need
said
rostov
throwing
the
letter
under
the
table
why
have
you
thrown
that
away
asked
boris
some
letter
recommendation
what
the
devil
want
for
why
what
the
devil
said
boris
picking
and
reading
the
address
this
letter
would
great
use
you
want
nothing
and
won
anyone
adjutant
why
not
inquired
boris
lackey
job
you
are
still
the
same
dreamer
see
remarked
boris
shaking
his
head
and
you
still
the
same
diplomatist
but
that
not
the
point
come
how
are
you
asked
rostov
well
you
see
far
everything
all
right
but
confess
should
much
like
adjutant
and
not
remain
the
front
why
because
when
once
man
starts
military
service
should
try
make
successful
career
possible
that
said
rostov
evidently
thinking
something
else
looked
intently
and
inquiringly
into
his
friend
eyes
evidently
trying
vain
find
the
answer
some
question
old
gabriel
brought
the
wine
shouldn
now
send
for
berg
asked
boris
would
drink
with
you
can
well
send
for
him
and
how
you
get
with
that
german
asked
rostov
with
contemptuous
smile
very
very
nice
honest
and
pleasant
fellow
answered
boris
again
rostov
looked
intently
into
boris
eyes
and
sighed
berg
returned
and
over
the
bottle
wine
conversation
between
the
three
officers
became
animated
the
guardsmen
told
rostov
their
march
and
how
they
had
been
made
much
russia
poland
and
abroad
they
spoke
the
sayings
and
doings
their
commander
the
grand
duke
and
told
stories
his
kindness
and
irascibility
berg
usual
kept
silent
when
the
subject
did
not
relate
himself
but
connection
with
the
stories
the
grand
duke
quick
temper
related
with
gusto
how
galicia
had
managed
deal
with
the
grand
duke
when
the
latter
made
tour
the
regiments
and
was
annoyed
the
irregularity
movement
with
pleasant
smile
berg
related
how
the
grand
duke
had
ridden
him
violent
passion
shouting
arnauts
arnauts
was
the
tsarevich
favorite
expression
when
was
rage
and
called
for
the
company
commander
would
you
believe
count
was
not
all
alarmed
because
knew
was
right
without
boasting
you
know
may
say
that
know
the
army
orders
heart
and
know
the
regulations
well
the
lord
prayer
count
there
never
any
negligence
company
and
conscience
was
ease
came
forward
berg
stood
and
showed
how
presented
himself
with
his
hand
his
cap
and
really
would
have
been
difficult
for
face
express
greater
respect
and
self
complacency
than
his
did
well
stormed
the
saying
stormed
and
stormed
and
stormed
was
not
matter
life
but
rather
death
the
saying
albanians
and
devils
and
siberia
said
berg
with
sagacious
smile
knew
was
the
right
kept
silent
was
not
that
best
count
hey
are
you
dumb
shouted
still
remained
silent
and
what
you
think
count
the
next
day
was
not
even
mentioned
the
orders
the
day
that
what
keeping
one
head
means
that
the
way
count
said
berg
lighting
his
pipe
and
emitting
rings
smoke
yes
that
was
fine
said
rostov
smiling
but
boris
noticed
that
was
preparing
make
fun
berg
and
skillfully
changed
the
subject
asked
him
tell
them
how
and
where
got
his
wound
this
pleased
rostov
and
began
talking
about
and
went
became
more
and
more
animated
told
them
his
schon
grabern
affair
just
those
who
have
taken
part
battle
generally
describe
that
they
would
like
have
been
they
have
heard
described
others
and
sounds
well
but
not
all
really
was
rostov
was
truthful
young
man
and
would
account
have
told
deliberate
lie
began
his
story
meaning
tell
everything
just
happened
but
imperceptibly
involuntarily
and
inevitably
lapsed
into
falsehood
had
told
the
truth
his
hearers
who
like
himself
had
often
heard
stories
attacks
and
had
formed
definite
idea
what
attack
was
and
were
expecting
hear
just
such
story
they
would
either
not
have
believed
him
still
worse
would
have
thought
that
rostov
was
himself
blame
since
what
generally
happens
the
narrators
cavalry
attacks
had
not
happened
him
could
not
tell
them
simply
that
everyone
went
trot
and
that
fell
off
his
horse
and
sprained
his
arm
and
then
ran
hard
could
from
frenchman
into
the
wood
besides
tell
everything
really
happened
would
have
been
necessary
make
effort
will
tell
only
what
happened
very
difficult
tell
the
truth
and
young
people
are
rarely
capable
his
hearers
expected
story
how
beside
himself
and
all
aflame
with
excitement
had
flown
like
storm
the
square
cut
his
way
slashed
right
and
left
how
his
saber
had
tasted
flesh
and
had
fallen
exhausted
and
and
told
them
all
that
the
middle
his
story
just
was
saying
you
cannot
imagine
what
strange
frenzy
one
experiences
during
attack
prince
andrew
whom
boris
was
expecting
entered
the
room
prince
andrew
who
liked
help
young
men
was
flattered
being
asked
for
his
assistance
and
being
well
disposed
toward
boris
who
had
managed
please
him
the
day
before
wished
what
the
young
man
wanted
having
been
sent
with
papers
from
kutuzov
the
tsarevich
looked
boris
hoping
find
him
alone
when
came
and
saw
hussar
the
line
recounting
his
military
exploits
prince
andrew
could
not
endure
that
sort
man
gave
boris
pleasant
smile
frowned
with
half
closed
eyes
looked
rostov
bowed
slightly
and
wearily
and
sat
down
languidly
the
sofa
felt
unpleasant
have
dropped
bad
company
rostov
flushed
noticing
this
but
did
not
care
this
was
mere
stranger
glancing
however
boris
saw
that
too
seemed
ashamed
the
hussar
the
line
spite
prince
andrew
disagreeable
ironical
tone
spite
the
contempt
with
which
rostov
from
his
fighting
army
point
view
regarded
all
these
little
adjutants
the
staff
whom
the
newcomer
was
evidently
one
rostov
felt
confused
blushed
and
became
silent
boris
inquired
what
news
there
might
the
staff
and
what
without
indiscretion
one
might
ask
about
our
plans
shall
probably
advance
replied
bolkonski
evidently
reluctant
say
more
the
presence
stranger
berg
took
the
opportunity
ask
with
great
politeness
whether
was
rumored
the
allowance
forage
money
captains
companies
would
doubled
this
prince
andrew
answered
with
smile
that
could
give
opinion
such
important
government
order
and
berg
laughed
gaily
your
business
prince
andrew
continued
addressing
boris
will
talk
later
and
looked
round
rostov
come
after
the
review
and
will
what
possible
and
having
glanced
round
the
room
prince
andrew
turned
rostov
whose
state
unconquerable
childish
embarrassment
now
changing
anger
did
not
condescend
notice
and
said
think
you
were
talking
the
schon
grabern
affair
were
you
there
was
there
said
rostov
angrily
intending
insult
the
aide
camp
bolkonski
noticed
the
hussar
state
mind
and
amused
him
with
slightly
contemptuous
smile
said
yes
there
are
many
stories
now
told
about
that
affair
yes
stories
repeated
rostov
loudly
looking
with
eyes
suddenly
grown
furious
now
boris
now
bolkonski
yes
many
stories
but
our
stories
are
the
stories
men
who
have
been
under
the
enemy
fire
our
stories
have
some
weight
not
like
the
stories
those
fellows
the
staff
who
get
rewards
without
doing
anything
whom
you
imagine
one
said
prince
andrew
with
quiet
and
particularly
amiable
smile
strange
feeling
exasperation
and
yet
respect
for
this
man
self
possession
mingled
that
moment
rostov
soul
not
talking
about
you
said
don
know
you
and
frankly
don
want
speaking
the
staff
general
and
will
tell
you
this
prince
andrew
interrupted
tone
quiet
authority
you
wish
insult
and
ready
agree
with
you
that
would
very
easy
you
haven
sufficient
self
respect
but
admit
that
the
time
and
place
are
very
badly
chosen
day
two
shall
all
have
take
part
greater
and
more
serious
duel
and
besides
drubetskoy
who
says
old
friend
yours
not
all
blame
that
face
has
the
misfortune
displease
you
however
added
rising
you
know
name
and
where
find
but
don
forget
that
not
regard
either
myself
you
having
been
all
insulted
and
man
older
than
you
advice
let
the
matter
drop
well
then
friday
after
the
review
shall
expect
you
drubetskoy
revoir
exclaimed
prince
andrew
and
with
bow
them
both
went
out
only
when
prince
andrew
was
gone
did
rostov
think
what
ought
have
said
and
was
still
more
angry
having
omitted
say
ordered
his
horse
once
and
coldly
taking
leave
boris
rode
home
should
headquarters
next
day
and
challenge
that
affected
adjutant
really
let
the
matter
drop
was
the
question
that
worried
him
all
the
way
thought
angrily
the
pleasure
would
have
seeing
the
fright
that
small
and
frail
but
proud
man
when
covered
his
pistol
and
then
felt
with
surprise
that
all
the
men
knew
there
was
none
would
much
like
have
for
friend
that
very
adjutant
whom
hated
chapter
viii
the
day
after
rostov
had
been
see
boris
review
was
held
the
austrian
and
russian
troops
both
those
freshly
arrived
from
russia
and
those
who
had
been
campaigning
under
kutuzov
the
two
emperors
the
russian
with
his
heir
the
tsarevich
and
the
austrian
with
the
archduke
inspected
the
allied
army
eighty
thousand
men
from
early
morning
the
smart
clean
troops
were
the
move
forming
the
field
before
the
fortress
now
thousands
feet
and
bayonets
moved
and
halted
the
officers
command
turned
with
banners
flying
formed
intervals
and
wheeled
round
other
similar
masses
infantry
different
uniforms
now
was
heard
the
rhythmic
beat
hoofs
and
the
jingling
showy
cavalry
blue
red
and
green
braided
uniforms
with
smartly
dressed
bandsmen
front
mounted
black
roan
gray
horses
then
again
spreading
out
with
the
brazen
clatter
the
polished
shining
cannon
that
quivered
the
gun
carriages
and
with
the
smell
linstocks
came
the
artillery
which
crawled
between
the
infantry
and
cavalry
and
took
its
appointed
position
not
only
the
generals
full
parade
uniforms
with
their
thin
thick
waists
drawn
the
utmost
their
red
necks
squeezed
into
their
stiff
collars
and
wearing
scarves
and
all
their
decorations
not
only
the
elegant
pomaded
officers
but
every
soldier
with
his
freshly
washed
and
shaven
face
and
his
weapons
clean
and
polished
the
utmost
and
every
horse
groomed
till
its
coat
shone
like
satin
and
every
hair
its
wetted
mane
lay
smooth
felt
that
small
matter
was
happening
but
important
and
solemn
affair
every
general
and
every
soldier
was
conscious
his
own
insignificance
aware
being
but
drop
that
ocean
men
and
yet
the
same
time
was
conscious
his
strength
part
that
enormous
whole
from
early
morning
strenuous
activities
and
efforts
had
begun
and
ten
clock
all
had
been
brought
into
due
order
the
ranks
were
drawn
the
vast
field
the
whole
army
was
extended
three
lines
the
cavalry
front
behind
the
artillery
and
behind
that
again
the
infantry
space
like
street
was
left
between
each
two
lines
troops
the
three
parts
that
army
were
sharply
distinguished
kutuzov
fighting
army
with
the
pavlograds
the
right
flank
the
front
those
recently
arrived
from
russia
both
guards
and
regiments
the
line
and
the
austrian
troops
but
they
all
stood
the
same
lines
under
one
command
and
like
order
like
wind
over
leaves
ran
excited
whisper
they
coming
they
coming
alarmed
voices
were
heard
and
stir
final
preparation
swept
over
all
the
troops
from
the
direction
olmutz
front
them
group
was
seen
approaching
and
that
moment
though
the
day
was
still
light
gust
wind
blowing
over
the
army
slightly
stirred
the
streamers
the
lances
and
the
unfolded
standards
fluttered
against
their
staffs
looked
that
slight
motion
the
army
itself
was
expressing
its
joy
the
approach
the
emperors
one
voice
was
heard
shouting
eyes
front
then
like
the
crowing
cocks
sunrise
this
was
repeated
others
from
various
sides
and
all
became
silent
the
deathlike
stillness
only
the
tramp
horses
was
heard
this
was
the
emperors
suites
the
emperors
rode
the
flank
and
the
trumpets
the
first
cavalry
regiment
played
the
general
march
seemed
though
not
the
trumpeters
were
playing
but
the
army
itself
rejoicing
the
emperors
approach
had
naturally
burst
into
music
amid
these
sounds
only
the
youthful
kindly
voice
the
emperor
alexander
was
clearly
heard
gave
the
words
greeting
and
the
first
regiment
roared
hurrah
deafeningly
continuously
and
joyfully
that
the
men
themselves
were
awed
their
multitude
and
the
immensity
the
power
they
constituted
rostov
standing
the
front
lines
kutuzov
army
which
the
tsar
approached
first
experienced
the
same
feeling
every
other
man
that
army
feeling
self
forgetfulness
proud
consciousness
might
and
passionate
attraction
him
who
was
the
cause
this
triumph
felt
that
single
word
from
that
man
all
this
vast
mass
and
himself
insignificant
atom
would
through
fire
and
water
commit
crime
die
perform
deeds
highest
heroism
and
could
not
but
tremble
and
his
heart
stand
still
the
imminence
that
word
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
thundered
from
all
sides
one
regiment
after
another
greeting
the
tsar
with
the
strains
the
march
and
then
hurrah
then
the
general
march
and
again
hurrah
hurrah
growing
ever
stronger
and
fuller
and
merging
into
deafening
roar
till
the
tsar
reached
each
regiment
its
silence
and
immobility
seemed
like
lifeless
body
but
soon
came
became
alive
its
thunder
joining
the
roar
the
whole
line
along
which
had
already
passed
through
the
terrible
and
deafening
roar
those
voices
amid
the
square
masses
troops
standing
motionless
turned
stone
hundreds
riders
composing
the
suites
moved
carelessly
but
symmetrically
and
above
all
freely
and
front
them
two
men
the
emperors
upon
them
the
undivided
tensely
passionate
attention
that
whole
mass
men
was
concentrated
the
handsome
young
emperor
alexander
the
uniform
the
horse
guards
wearing
cocked
hat
with
its
peaks
front
and
back
with
his
pleasant
face
and
resonant
though
not
loud
voice
attracted
everyone
attention
rostov
was
not
far
from
the
trumpeters
and
with
his
keen
sight
had
recognized
the
tsar
and
watched
his
approach
when
was
within
twenty
paces
and
nicholas
could
clearly
distinguish
every
detail
his
handsome
happy
young
face
experienced
feeling
tenderness
and
ecstasy
such
had
never
before
known
every
trait
and
every
movement
the
tsar
seemed
him
enchanting
stopping
front
the
pavlograds
the
tsar
said
something
french
the
austrian
emperor
and
smiled
seeing
that
smile
rostov
involuntarily
smiled
himself
and
felt
still
stronger
flow
love
for
his
sovereign
longed
show
that
love
some
way
and
knowing
that
this
was
impossible
was
ready
cry
the
tsar
called
the
colonel
the
regiment
and
said
few
words
him
god
what
would
happen
the
emperor
spoke
thought
rostov
should
die
happiness
the
tsar
addressed
the
officers
also
thank
you
all
gentlemen
thank
you
with
whole
heart
rostov
every
word
sounded
like
voice
from
heaven
how
gladly
would
have
died
once
for
his
tsar
you
have
earned
the
george
standards
and
will
worthy
them
die
die
for
him
thought
rostov
the
tsar
said
something
more
which
rostov
did
not
hear
and
the
soldiers
straining
their
lungs
shouted
hurrah
rostov
too
bending
over
his
saddle
shouted
hurrah
with
all
his
might
feeling
that
would
like
injure
himself
that
shout
only
express
his
rapture
fully
the
tsar
stopped
few
minutes
front
the
hussars
undecided
how
can
the
emperor
undecided
thought
rostov
but
then
even
this
indecision
appeared
him
majestic
and
enchanting
like
everything
else
the
tsar
did
that
hesitation
lasted
only
instant
the
tsar
foot
the
narrow
pointed
boot
then
fashionable
touched
the
groin
the
bobtailed
bay
mare
rode
his
hand
white
glove
gathered
the
reins
and
moved
off
accompanied
irregularly
swaying
sea
aides
camp
farther
and
farther
rode
away
stopping
other
regiments
till
last
only
his
white
plumes
were
visible
rostov
from
amid
the
suites
that
surrounded
the
emperors
among
the
gentlemen
the
suite
rostov
noticed
bolkonski
sitting
his
horse
indolently
and
carelessly
rostov
recalled
their
quarrel
yesterday
and
the
question
presented
itself
whether
ought
ought
not
challenge
bolkonski
course
not
now
thought
worth
thinking
speaking
such
moment
time
such
love
such
rapture
and
such
self
sacrifice
what
any
our
quarrels
and
affronts
matter
love
and
forgive
everybody
now
when
the
emperor
had
passed
nearly
all
the
regiments
the
troops
began
ceremonial
march
past
him
and
rostov
bedouin
recently
purchased
from
denisov
rode
past
too
the
rear
his
squadron
that
alone
and
full
view
the
emperor
before
reached
him
rostov
who
was
splendid
horseman
spurred
bedouin
twice
and
successfully
put
him
the
showy
trot
which
the
animal
went
when
excited
bending
his
foaming
muzzle
his
chest
his
tail
extended
bedouin
also
conscious
the
emperor
eye
upon
him
passed
splendidly
lifting
his
feet
with
high
and
graceful
action
flying
through
the
air
without
touching
the
ground
rostov
himself
his
legs
well
back
and
his
stomach
drawn
and
feeling
himself
one
with
his
horse
rode
past
the
emperor
with
frowning
but
blissful
face
like
vewy
devil
denisov
expressed
fine
fellows
the
pavlograds
remarked
the
emperor
god
how
happy
should
ordered
leap
into
the
fire
this
instant
thought
rostov
when
the
review
was
over
the
newly
arrived
officers
and
also
kutuzov
collected
groups
and
began
talk
about
the
awards
about
the
austrians
and
their
uniforms
about
their
lines
about
bonaparte
and
how
badly
the
latter
would
fare
now
especially
the
essen
corps
arrived
and
prussia
took
our
side
but
the
talk
every
group
was
chiefly
about
the
emperor
alexander
his
every
word
and
movement
was
described
with
ecstasy
they
all
had
but
one
wish
advance
soon
possible
against
the
enemy
under
the
emperor
command
commanded
the
emperor
himself
they
could
not
fail
vanquish
anyone
whom
might
thought
rostov
and
most
the
officers
after
the
review
all
were
then
more
confident
victory
than
the
winning
two
battles
would
have
made
them
chapter
the
day
after
the
review
boris
his
best
uniform
and
with
his
comrade
berg
best
wishes
for
success
rode
olmutz
see
bolkonski
wishing
profit
his
friendliness
and
obtain
for
himself
the
best
post
could
preferably
that
adjutant
some
important
personage
position
the
army
which
seemed
him
most
attractive
all
very
well
for
rostov
whose
father
sends
him
ten
thousand
rubles
time
talk
about
not
wishing
cringe
anybody
and
not
anyone
lackey
but
who
have
nothing
but
brains
have
make
career
and
must
not
miss
opportunities
but
must
avail
myself
them
reflected
did
not
find
prince
andrew
olmutz
that
day
but
the
appearance
the
town
where
the
headquarters
and
the
diplomatic
corps
were
stationed
and
the
two
emperors
were
living
with
their
suites
households
and
courts
only
strengthened
his
desire
belong
that
higher
world
knew
one
and
despite
his
smart
guardsman
uniform
all
these
exalted
personages
passing
the
streets
their
elegant
carriages
with
their
plumes
ribbons
and
medals
both
courtiers
and
military
men
seemed
immeasurably
above
him
insignificant
officer
the
guards
that
they
not
only
did
not
wish
but
simply
could
not
aware
his
existence
the
quarters
the
commander
chief
kutuzov
where
inquired
for
bolkonski
all
the
adjutants
and
even
the
orderlies
looked
him
they
wished
impress
him
that
great
many
officers
like
him
were
always
coming
there
and
that
everybody
was
heartily
sick
them
spite
this
rather
because
next
day
november
after
dinner
again
went
olmutz
and
entering
the
house
occupied
kutuzov
asked
for
bolkonski
prince
andrew
was
and
boris
was
shown
into
large
hall
probably
formerly
used
for
dancing
but
which
five
beds
now
stood
and
furniture
various
kinds
table
chairs
and
clavichord
one
adjutant
nearest
the
door
was
sitting
the
table
persian
dressing
gown
writing
another
the
red
stout
nesvitski
lay
bed
with
his
arms
under
his
head
laughing
with
officer
who
had
sat
down
beside
him
third
was
playing
viennese
waltz
the
clavichord
while
fourth
lying
the
clavichord
sang
the
tune
bolkonski
was
not
there
none
these
gentlemen
changed
his
position
seeing
boris
the
one
who
was
writing
and
whom
boris
addressed
turned
round
crossly
and
told
him
bolkonski
was
duty
and
that
should
through
the
door
the
left
into
the
reception
room
wished
see
him
boris
thanked
him
and
went
the
reception
room
where
found
some
ten
officers
and
generals
when
entered
prince
andrew
his
eyes
drooping
contemptuously
with
that
peculiar
expression
polite
weariness
which
plainly
says
were
not
duty
would
not
talk
you
for
moment
was
listening
old
russian
general
with
decorations
who
stood
very
erect
almost
tiptoe
with
soldier
obsequious
expression
his
purple
face
reporting
something
very
well
then
good
wait
said
prince
andrew
the
general
russian
speaking
with
the
french
intonation
affected
when
wished
speak
contemptuously
and
noticing
boris
prince
andrew
paying
more
heed
the
general
who
ran
after
him
imploring
him
hear
something
more
nodded
and
turned
him
with
cheerful
smile
that
moment
boris
clearly
realized
what
had
before
surmised
that
the
army
besides
the
subordination
and
discipline
prescribed
the
military
code
which
and
the
others
knew
the
regiment
there
was
another
more
important
subordination
which
made
this
tight
laced
purple
faced
general
wait
respectfully
while
captain
prince
andrew
for
his
own
pleasure
chose
chat
with
lieutenant
drubetskoy
more
than
ever
was
boris
resolved
serve
future
not
according
the
written
code
but
under
this
unwritten
law
felt
now
that
merely
having
been
recommended
prince
andrew
had
already
risen
above
the
general
who
the
front
had
the
power
annihilate
him
lieutenant
the
guards
prince
andrew
came
him
and
took
his
hand
very
sorry
you
did
not
find
yesterday
was
fussing
about
with
germans
all
day
went
with
weyrother
survey
the
dispositions
when
germans
start
being
accurate
there
end
boris
smiled
understood

while
prince
andrew
went

about
the
purple
faced
general
that
gentleman
evidently
not
sharing
boris
conception
the
advantages
the
unwritten
code
subordination
looked
fixedly
the
presumptuous
lieutenant
who
had
prevented
his
finishing
what
had
say
the
adjutant
that
boris
felt
uncomfortable
turned
away
and
waited
impatiently
for
prince
andrew
return
from
the
commander
chief
room
you
see
dear
fellow
have
been
thinking
about
you
said
prince
andrew
when
they
had
gone
into
the
large
room
where
the
clavichord
was
use
your
going
the
commander
chief
would
say
lot
pleasant
things
ask
you
dinner
that
would
not
bad
regards
the
unwritten
code
thought
boris
but
nothing
more
would
come
there
will
soon
battalion
aides
camp
and
adjutants
but
this
what
have
good
friend
adjutant
general
and
excellent
fellow
prince
dolgorukov
and
though
you
may
not
know
the
fact
that
now
kutuzov
with
his
staff
and
all
count
for
nothing
everything
now
centered
round
the
emperor
will
dolgorukov
have
there
anyhow
and
have
already
spoken
him
about
you
shall
see
whether
cannot
attach
you
himself
find
place
for
you
somewhere
nearer
the
sun
prince
andrew
always
became
specially
keen
when
had
guide
young
man
and
help
him
worldly
success
under
cover
obtaining
help
this
kind
for
another
which
from
pride
would
never
accept
for
himself
kept
touch
with
the
circle
which
confers
success
and
which
attracted
him
very
readily
took
boris
cause
and
went
with
him
dolgorukov
was
late
the
evening
when
they
entered
the
palace
olmutz
occupied
the
emperors
and
their
retinues
that
same
day
council
war
had
been
held
which
all
the
members
the
hofkriegsrath
and
both
emperors
took
part
that
council
contrary
the
views
the
old
generals
kutuzov
and
prince
schwartzenberg
had
been
decided
advance
immediately
and
give
battle
bonaparte
the
council
war
was
just
over
when
prince
andrew
accompanied
boris
arrived
the
palace
find
dolgorukov
everyone
headquarters
was
still
under
the
spell
the
day
council
which
the
party
the
young
had
triumphed
the
voices
those
who
counseled
delay
and
advised
waiting
for
something
else
before
advancing
had
been
completely
silenced
and
their
arguments
confuted
such
conclusive
evidence
the
advantages
attacking
that
what
had
been
discussed
the
council
the
coming
battle
and
the
victory
that
would
certainly
result
from
longer
seemed
the
future
but
the
past
all
the
advantages
were
our
side
our
enormous
forces
undoubtedly
superior
napoleon
were
concentrated
one
place
the
troops
inspired
the
emperors
presence
were
eager
for
action
the
strategic
position
where
the
operations
would
take
place
was
familiar
all
its
details
the
austrian
general
weyrother
lucky
accident
had
ordained
that
the
austrian
army
should
maneuver
the
previous
year
the
very
fields
where
the
french
had
now
fought
the
adjacent
locality
was
known
and
shown
every
detail
the
maps
and
bonaparte
evidently
weakened
was
undertaking
nothing
dolgorukov
one
the
warmest
advocates
attack
had
just
returned
from
the
council
tired
and
exhausted
but
eager
and
proud
the
victory
that
had
been
gained
prince
andrew
introduced
his
protege
but
prince
dolgorukov
politely
and
firmly
pressing
his
hand
said
nothing
boris
and
evidently
unable
suppress
the
thoughts
which
were
uppermost
his
mind
that
moment
addressed
prince
andrew
french
dear
fellow
what
battle
have
gained
god
grant
that
the
one
that
will
result
from
will
victorious
however
dear
fellow
said
abruptly
and
eagerly
must
confess
having
been
unjust
the
austrians
and
especially
weyrother
what
exactitude
what
minuteness
what
knowledge
the
locality
what
foresight
for
every
eventuality
every
possibility
even
the
smallest
detail
dear
fellow
conditions
better
than
our
present
ones
could
have
been
devised
this
combination
austrian
precision
with
russian
valor
what
more
could
wished
for
the
attack
definitely
resolved
asked
bolkonski
and
you
know
dear
fellow
seems
that
bonaparte
has
decidedly
lost
bearings
you
know
that
letter
was
received
from
him
today
for
the
emperor
dolgorukov
smiled
significantly
that
and
what
did
say
inquired
bolkonski
what
can
say
tra
and
merely
gain
time
tell
you
our
hands
that
certain
but
what
was
most
amusing
continued
with
sudden
good
natured
laugh
was
that
could
not
think
how
address
the
reply
not
consul
and
course
not
emperor
seemed
should
general
bonaparte
but
between
not
recognizing
him
emperor
and
calling
him
general
bonaparte
there
difference
remarked
bolkonski
that
just
interrupted
dolgorukov
quickly
laughing
you
know
bilibin
very
clever
fellow
suggested
addressing
him
usurper
and
enemy
mankind
dolgorukov
laughed
merrily
only
that
said
bolkonski
all
the
same
was
bilibin
who
found
suitable
form
for
the
address
wise
and
clever
fellow
what
was
the
head
the
french
government
chef
gouvernement
francais
said
dolgorukov
with
grave
satisfaction
good
wasn
yes
but
will
dislike
extremely
said
bolkonski
yes
very
much
brother
knows
him
dined
with
him
the
present
emperor
more
than
once
paris
and
tells
never
met
more
cunning
subtle
diplomatist
you
know
combination
french
adroitness
and
italian
play
acting
you
know
the
tale
about
him
and
count
markov
count
markov
was
the
only
man
who
knew
how
handle
him
you
know
the
story
the
handkerchief
delightful
and
the
talkative
dolgorukov
turning
now
boris
now
prince
andrew
told
how
bonaparte
wishing
test
markov
our
ambassador
purposely
dropped
handkerchief
front
him
and
stood
looking
markov
probably
expecting
markov
pick
for
him
and
how
markov
immediately
dropped
his
own
beside
and
picked
without
touching
bonaparte
delightful
said
bolkonski
but
have
come
you
prince
petitioner
behalf
this
young
man
you
see
but
before
prince
andrew
could
finish
aide
camp
came
summon
dolgorukov
the
emperor
what
nuisance
said
dolgorukov
getting
hurriedly
and
pressing
the
hands
prince
andrew
and
boris
you
know
should
very
glad
all
power
both
for
you
and
for
this
dear
young
man
again
pressed
the
hand
the
latter
with
expression
good
natured
sincere
and
animated
levity
but
you
see
another
time
boris
was
excited
the
thought
being
close
the
higher
powers
felt
himself
that
moment
was
conscious
that
here
was
contact
with
the
springs
that
set
motion
the
enormous
movements
the
mass
which
his
regiment
felt
himself
tiny
obedient
and
insignificant
atom
they
followed
prince
dolgorukov
out
into
the
corridor
and
met
coming
out
the
door
the
emperor
room
which
dolgorukov
had
entered
short
man
civilian
clothes
with
clever
face
and
sharply
projecting
jaw
which
without
spoiling
his
face
gave
him
peculiar
vivacity
and
shiftiness
expression
this
short
man
nodded
dolgorukov
intimate
friend
and
stared
prince
andrew
with
cool
intensity
walking
straight
toward
him
and
evidently
expecting
him
bow
step
out
his
way
prince
andrew
did
neither
look
animosity
appeared
his
face
and
the
other
turned
away
and
went
down
the
side
the
corridor
who
was
that
asked
boris
one
the
most
remarkable
but
most
unpleasant
men
the
minister
foreign
affairs
prince
adam
czartoryski
such
men
who
decide
the
fate
nations
added
bolkonski
with
sigh
could
not
suppress
they
passed
out
the
palace
next
day
the
army
began
its
campaign
and
the
very
battle
austerlitz
boris
was
unable
see
either
prince
andrew
dolgorukov
again
and
remained
for
while
with
the
ismaylov
regiment
chapter
dawn
the
sixteenth
november
denisov
squadron
which
nicholas
rostov
served
and
which
was
prince
bagration
detachment
moved
from
the
place
where
had
spent
the
night
advancing
into
action
arranged
and
after
going
behind
other
columns
for
about
two
thirds
mile
was
stopped
the
highroad
rostov
saw
the
cossacks
and
then
the
first
and
second
squadrons
hussars
and
infantry
battalions
and
artillery
pass
and
forward
and
then
generals
bagration
and
dolgorukov
ride
past
with
their
adjutants
all
the
fear
before
action
which
had
experienced
previously
all
the
inner
struggle
conquer
that
fear
all
his
dreams
distinguishing
himself
true
hussar
this
battle
had
been
wasted
their
squadron
remained
reserve
and
nicholas
rostov
spent
that
day
dull
and
wretched
mood
nine
the
morning
heard
firing
front
and
shouts
hurrah
and
saw
wounded
being
brought
back
there
were
not
many
them
and
last
saw
how
whole
detachment
french
cavalry
was
brought
convoyed
sotnya
cossacks
evidently
the
affair
was
over
and
though
not
big
had
been
successful
engagement
the
men
and
officers
returning
spoke
brilliant
victory
the
occupation
the
town
wischau
and
the
capture
whole
french
squadron
the
day
was
bright
and
sunny
after
sharp
night
frost
and
the
cheerful
glitter
that
autumn
day
was
keeping
with
the
news
victory
which
was
conveyed
not
only
the
tales
those
who
had
taken
part
but
also
the
joyful
expression
the
faces
soldiers
officers
generals
and
adjutants
they
passed
rostov
going
coming
and
nicholas
who
had
vainly
suffered
all
the
dread
that
precedes
battle
and
had
spent
that
happy
day
inactivity
was
all
the
more
depressed
come
here
wostov
let
dwink
dwown
our
gwief
shouted
denisov
who
had
settled
down
the
roadside
with
flask
and
some
food
the
officers
gathered
round
denisov
canteen
eating
and
talking
there
they
are
bringing
another
cried
one
the
officers
indicating
captive
french
dragoon
who
was
being
brought
foot
two
cossacks
one
them
was
leading
the
bridle
fine
large
french
horse
had
taken
from
the
prisoner
sell
that
horse
denisov
called
out
the
cossacks
you
like
your
honor
the
officers
got
and
stood
round
the
cossacks
and
their
prisoner
the
french
dragoon
was
young
alsatian
who
spoke
french
with
german
accent
was
breathless
with
agitation
his
face
was
red
and
when
heard
some
french
spoken
once
began
speaking
the
officers
addressing
first
one
then
another
said
would
not
have
been
taken
was
not
his
fault
but
the
corporal
who
had
sent
him
seize
some
horsecloths
though
had
told
him
the
russians
were
there
and
every
word
added
but
don
hurt
little
horse
and
stroked
the
animal
was
plain
that
did
not
quite
grasp
where
was
now
excused
himself
for
having
been
taken
prisoner
and
now
imagining
himself
before
his
own
officers
insisted
his
soldierly
discipline
and
zeal
the
service
brought
with
him
into
our
rearguard
all
the
freshness
atmosphere
the
french
army
which
was
alien
the
cossacks
sold
the
horse
for
two
gold
pieces
and
rostov
being
the
richest
the
officers
now
that
had
received
his
money
bought
but
don
hurt
little
horse
said
the
alsatian
good
naturedly
rostov
when
the
animal
was
handed
over
the
hussar
rostov
smilingly
reassured
the
dragoon
and
gave
him
money
alley
alley
said
the
cossack
touching
the
prisoner
arm
make
him
the
emperor
the
emperor
was
suddenly
heard
among
the
hussars
all
began
run
and
bustle
and
rostov
saw
coming
the
road
behind
him
several
riders
with
white
plumes
their
hats
moment
everyone
was
his
place
waiting
rostov
did
not
know
remember
how
ran
his
place
and
mounted
instantly
his
regret
not
having
been
action
and
his
dejected
mood
amid
people
whom
was
weary
had
gone
instantly
every
thought
himself
had
vanished
was
filled
with
happiness
his
nearness
the
emperor
felt
that
this
nearness
itself
made
him
for
the
day
had
lost
was
happy
lover
when
the
longed
for
moment
meeting
arrives
not
daring
look
round
and
without
looking
round
was
ecstatically
conscious
his
approach
felt
not
only
from
the
sound
the
hoofs
the
approaching
cavalcade
but
because
drew
near
everything
grew
brighter
more
joyful
more
significant
and
more
festive
around
him
nearer
and
nearer
rostov
came
that
sun
shedding
beams
mild
and
majestic
light
around
and
already
felt
himself
enveloped
those
beams
heard
his
voice
that
kindly
calm
and
majestic
voice
that
was
yet
simple
and
accord
with
rostov
feeling
there
was
deathly
stillness
amid
which
was
heard
the
emperor
voice
the
pavlograd
hussars
inquired
the
reserves
sire
replied
voice
very
human
one
compared
that
which
had
said
the
pavlograd
hussars
the
emperor
drew
level
with
rostov
and
halted
alexander
face
was
even
more
beautiful
than
had
been
three
days
before
the
review
shone
with
such
gaiety
and
youth
such
innocent
youth
that
suggested
the
liveliness
fourteen
year
old
boy
and
yet
was
the
face
the
majestic
emperor
casually
while
surveying
the
squadron
the
emperor
eyes
met
rostov
and
rested
them
for
not
more
than
two
seconds
whether
the
emperor
understood
what
was
going
rostov
soul
seemed
rostov
that
understood
everything
any
rate
his
light
blue
eyes
gazed
for
about
two
seconds
into
rostov
face
gentle
mild
light
poured
from
them
then
all
once
raised
his
eyebrows
abruptly
touched
his
horse
with
his
left
foot
and
galloped
the
younger
emperor
could
not
restrain
his
wish
present
the
battle
and
spite
the
remonstrances
his
courtiers
twelve
clock
left
the
third
column
with
which
had
been
and
galloped
toward
the
vanguard
before
came
with
the
hussars
several
adjutants
met
him
with
news
the
successful
result
the
action
this
battle
which
consisted
the
capture
french
squadron
was
represented
brilliant
victory
over
the
french
and
the
emperor
and
the
whole
army
especially
while
the
smoke
hung
over
the
battlefield
believed
that
the
french
had
been
defeated
and
were
retreating
against
their
will
few
minutes
after
the
emperor
had
passed
the
pavlograd
division
was
ordered
advance
wischau
itself
petty
german
town
rostov
saw
the
emperor
again
the
market
place
where
there
had
been
some
rather
heavy
firing
before
the
emperor
arrival
lay
several
killed
and
wounded
soldiers
whom
there
had
not
been
time
move
the
emperor
surrounded
his
suite
officers
and
courtiers
was
riding
bobtailed
chestnut
mare
different
one
from
that
which
had
ridden
the
review
and
bending
one
side
gracefully
held
gold
lorgnette
his
eyes
and
looked
soldier
who
lay
prone
with
blood
his
uncovered
head
the
wounded
soldier
was
dirty
coarse
and
revolting
that
his
proximity
the
emperor
shocked
rostov
rostov
saw
how
the
emperor
rather
round
shoulders
shuddered
cold
shiver
had
run
down
them
how
his
left
foot
began
convulsively
tapping
the
horse
side
with
the
spur
and
how
the
well
trained
horse
looked
round
unconcerned
and
did
not
stir
adjutant
dismounting
lifted
the
soldier
under
the
arms
place
him
stretcher
that
had
been
brought
the
soldier
groaned
gently
gently
can
you
more
gently
said
the
emperor
apparently
suffering
more
than
the
dying
soldier
and
rode
away
rostov
saw
tears
filling
the
emperor
eyes
and
heard
him
was
riding
away
say
czartoryski
what
terrible
thing

what
terrible
thing
quelle
terrible

que

the
troops
the

stationed
before

within
sight
the

lines
which
all
day
long
had
yielded
ground
the
least
firing
the
emperor
gratitude
was
announced
the
vanguard
rewards
were
promised
and
the
men
received
double
ration
vodka
the
campfires
crackled
and
the
soldiers
songs
resounded
even
more
merrily
than
the
previous
night
denisov
celebrated
his
promotion
the
rank
major
and
rostov
who
had
already
drunk
enough
the
end
the
feast
proposed
the
emperor
health

rang
the
enthusiastic
voices
the
officers
and
the
old
cavalry
captain
kirsten

enthusiastically
and
less
sincerely
than
the
twenty
year
old
rostov
when
the
officers
had
emptied
and
smashed
their
glasses
kirsten
filled
others
and

his
dashing
old
hussar
baritone
the
hussars
crowded
round
and
responded
heartily
with
loud
shouts
late
that
night
when
all
had
separated
denisov
with
his
short
hand
patted
his
favorite
rostov
the
shoulder
there
one
fall

cried
rostov
such
lofty

such
believe

and

and
appwove
you
don

and
rostov
got
and
went
wandering
among
the
campfires
dreaming
what
happiness
would
die
not
saving
the
emperor
life
did
not
even
dare
dream
that
but
simply
die
before
his
eyes
really
was
love
with
the
tsar
and
the
glory
the
russian
arms
and
the
hope
future
triumph
and
was
not
the
only
man
experience
that
feeling
during
those
memorable
days
preceding
the
battle
austerlitz
nine
tenths
the
men
the
russian
army
were
then
love
though
less
ecstatically
with
their
tsar
and
the
glory
the
russian
arms
chapter
the
next
day
the
emperor
stopped
wischau
and
villier
his
physician
was
repeatedly
summoned
see
him
headquarters
and
among
the
troops
near
the
news
spread
that
the
emperor
was
unwell
ate
nothing
and
had
slept
badly
that
night
those
around
him
reported
the
cause
this
indisposition
was
the
strong
impression
made
his
sensitive
mind
the
sight
the
killed
and
wounded
daybreak
the
seventeenth
french
officer
who
had
come
with
flag
truce
demanding
audience
with
the
russian
emperor
was
brought
into
wischau
from
our
outposts
this
officer
was
savary
the
emperor
had
only
just
fallen
asleep
and
savary
had
wait
midday
was
admitted
the
emperor
and
hour
later
rode
off
with
prince
dolgorukov
the
advanced
post
the
french
army
was
rumored
that
savary
had
been
sent
propose
alexander
meeting
with
napoleon
the
joy
and
pride
the
whole
army
personal
interview
was
refused
and
instead
the
sovereign
prince
dolgorukov
the
victor
wischau
was
sent
with
savary
negotiate
with
napoleon
contrary
expectations
these
negotiations
were
actuated
real
desire
for
peace
toward
evening
dolgorukov
came
back
went
straight
the
tsar
and
remained
alone
with
him
for
long
time
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
november
the
army
advanced
two
days
march
and
the
enemy
outposts
after
brief
interchange
shots
retreated
the
highest
army
circles
from
midday
the
nineteenth
great
excitedly
bustling
activity
began
which
lasted
till
the
morning
the
twentieth
when
the
memorable
battle
austerlitz
was
fought
till
midday
the
nineteenth
the
activity
the
eager
talk
running
and
fro
and
dispatching
adjutants
was
confined
the
emperor
headquarters
but
the
afternoon
that
day
this
activity
reached
kutuzov
headquarters
and
the
staffs
the
commanders
columns
evening
the
adjutants
had
spread
all
ends
and
parts
the
army
and
the
night
from
the
nineteenth
the
twentieth
the
whole
eighty
thousand
allied
troops
rose
from
their
bivouacs
the
hum
voices
and
the
army
swayed
and
started
one
enormous
mass
six
miles
long
the
concentrated
activity
which
had
begun
the
emperor
headquarters
the
morning
and
had
started
the
whole
movement
that
followed
was
like
the
first
movement
the
main
wheel
large
tower
clock
one
wheel
slowly
moved
another
was
set
motion
and
third
and
wheels
began
revolve
faster
and
faster
levers
and
cogwheels
work
chimes
play
figures
pop
out
and
the
hands
advance
with
regular
motion
result
all
that
activity
just
the
mechanism
clock
the
mechanism
the
military
machine
impulse
once
given
leads
the
final
result
and
just
indifferently
quiescent
till
the
moment
when
motion
transmitted
them
are
the
parts
the
mechanism
which
the
impulse
has
not
yet
reached
wheels
creak
their

the

engage
one
another
and
the
revolving
pulleys
whirr
with
the
rapidity
their
movement
but
neighboring
wheel
quiet
and
motionless
though
were
prepared
remain
for
hundred
years
but
the
moment
comes
when
the
lever
catches
and
obeying
the
impulse
that
wheel
begins
creak
and
joins
the
common
motion
the
result
and
aim
which
are
beyond
its

just
clock
the

the
complicated

innumerable

merely
slow

was
only
the
loss
the

the

that

slow

the
dial
human
history
prince
andrew
was
duty
that
day
and
constant
attendance
the
commander
chief
six
the
evening
kutuzov
went
the
emperor
headquarters
and
after
staying
but
short
time
with
the
tsar
went
see
the
grand
marshal
the
court
count
tolstoy
bolkonski
took
the
opportunity
get
some
details
the
coming
action
from
dolgorukov
felt
that
kutuzov
was
upset
and
dissatisfied
about
something
and
that
headquarters
they
were
dissatisfied
with
him
and
also
that
the
emperor
headquarters
everyone
adopted
toward
him
the
tone
men
who
know
something
others
not
know
therefore
wished
speak
dolgorukov
well
how
you
dear
fellow
said
dolgorukov
who
was
sitting
tea
with
bilibin
the
fete
for
tomorrow
how
your
old
fellow
out
sorts
won
say
out
sorts
but
fancy
would
like
heard
but
they
heard
him
the
council
war
and
will
hear
him
when
talks
sense
but
temporize
and
wait
for
something
now
when
bonaparte
fears
nothing
much
general
battle
impossible
yes
you
have
seen
him
said
prince
andrew
well
what
bonaparte
like
how
did
impress
you
yes
saw
him
and
convinced
that
fears
nothing
much
general
engagement
repeated
dolgorukov
evidently
prizing
this
general
conclusion
which
had
arrived
from
his
interview
with
napoleon
weren
afraid
battle
why
did
ask
for
that
interview
why
negotiate
and
above
all
why
retreat
when
retreat
contrary
his
method
conducting
war
believe
afraid
afraid
general
battle
his
hour
has
come
mark
words
but
tell
what
like
said
prince
andrew
again
man
gray
overcoat
very
anxious
that
should
call
him
your
majesty
but
who
his
chagrin
got
title
from
that
the
sort
man
and
nothing
more
replied
dolgorukov
looking
round
bilibin
with
smile
despite
great
respect
for
old
kutuzov
continued
should
nice
set
fellows
were
wait
about
and
give
him
chance
escape
trick
now
that
certainly
have
him
our
hands
mustn
forget
suvorov
and
his
rule
not
put
yourself
position
attacked
but
yourself
attack
believe
war
the
energy
young
men
often
shows
the
way
better
than
all
the
experience
old
cunctators
but
what
position
are
going
attack
him
have
been
the
outposts
today
and
impossible
say
where
his
chief
forces
are
situated
said
prince
andrew
wished
explain
dolgorukov
plan
attack
had
himself
formed
that
all
the
same
dolgorukov
said
quickly
and
getting
spread
map
the
table
all
eventualities
have
been
foreseen
standing
before
brunn
and
prince
dolgorukov
rapidly
but
indistinctly
explained
weyrother
plan
flanking
movement
prince
andrew
began
reply
and
state
his
own
plan
which
might
have
been
good
weyrother
but
for
the
disadvantage
that
weyrother
had
already
been
approved
soon
prince
andrew
began
demonstrate
the
defects
the
latter
and
the
merits
his
own
plan
prince
dolgorukov
ceased
listen
him
and
gazed
absent
mindedly
not
the
map
but
prince
andrew
face
there
will
council
war
kutuzov
tonight
though
you
can
say
all
this
there
remarked
dolgorukov
will
said
prince
andrew
moving
away
from
the
map
whatever
are
you
bothering
about
gentlemen
said
bilibin
who
till
then
had
listened
with
amused
smile
their
conversation
and
now
was
evidently
ready
with
joke
whether
tomorrow
brings
victory
defeat
the
glory
our
russian
arms
secure
except
your
kutuzov
there
not
single
russian
command
column
the
commanders
are
herr
general
wimpfen
comte
langeron
prince
lichtenstein
prince
hohenlohe
and
finally
prishprish
and
like
all
those
polish
names
quiet
backbiter
said
dolgorukov
not
true
there
are
now
two
russians
miloradovich
and
dokhturov
and
there
would
third
count
arakcheev
his
nerves
were
not
too
weak
however
think
general
kutuzov
has
come
out
said
prince
andrew
wish
you
good
luck
and
success
gentlemen
added
and
went
out
after
shaking
hands
with
dolgorukov
and
bilibin
the
way
home
prince
andrew
could
not
refrain
from
asking
kutuzov
who
was
sitting
silently
beside
him
what
thought
tomorrow
battle
kutuzov
looked
sternly
his
adjutant
and
after
pause
replied
think
the
battle
will
lost
and
told
count
tolstoy
and
asked
him
tell
the
emperor
what
you
think
replied
but
dear
general
engaged
with
rice
and
cutlets
look
after
military
matters
yourself
yes
that
was
the
answer
got
chapter
xii
shortly
after
nine
clock
that
evening
weyrother
drove
with
his
plans
kutuzov
quarters
where
the
council
war
was
held
all
the
commanders
columns
were
summoned
the
commander
chief
and
with
the
exception
prince
bagration
who
declined
come
were
all
there
the
appointed
time
weyrother
who
was
full
control
the
proposed
battle
his
eagerness
and
briskness
presented
marked
contrast
the
dissatisfied
and
drowsy
kutuzov
who
reluctantly
played
the
part
chairman
and
president
the
council
war
weyrother
evidently
felt
himself
the
head
movement
that
had
already
become
unrestrainable
was
like
horse
running
downhill
harnessed
heavy
cart
whether
was
pulling
being
pushed
did
not
know
but
rushed
along
headlong
speed
with
time
consider
what
this
movement
might
lead
weyrother
had
been
twice
that
evening
the
enemy
picket
line
reconnoiter
personally
and
twice
the
emperors
russian
and
austrian
report
and
explain
and
his
headquarters
where
had
dictated
the
dispositions
german
and
now
much
exhausted
arrived
kutuzov
was
evidently
busy
that
even
forgot
polite
the
commander
chief
interrupted
him
talked
rapidly
and
indistinctly
without
looking
the
man
was
addressing
and
did
not
reply
questions
put
him
was
bespattered
with
mud
and
had
pitiful
weary
and
distracted
air
though
the
same
time
was
haughty
and
self
confident
kutuzov
was
occupying
nobleman
castle
modest
dimensions
near
ostralitz
the
large
drawing
room
which
had
become
the
commander
chief
office
were
gathered
kutuzov
himself
weyrother
and
the
members
the
council
war
they
were
drinking
tea
and
only
awaited
prince
bagration
begin
the
council
last
bagration
orderly
came
with
the
news
that
the
prince
could
not
attend
prince
andrew
came
inform
the
commander
chief
this
and
availing
himself
permission
previously
given
him
kutuzov
present
the
council
remained
the
room
since
prince
bagration
not
coming
may
begin
said
weyrother
hurriedly
rising
from
his
seat
and
going
the
table
which
enormous
map
the
environs
brunn
was
spread
out
kutuzov
with
his
uniform
unbuttoned
that
his
fat
neck
bulged
over
his
collar
escaping
was
sitting
almost
asleep
low
chair
with
his
podgy
old
hands
resting
symmetrically
its
arms
the
sound
weyrother
voice
opened
his
one
eye
with
effort
yes
yes
you
please
already
late
said
and
nodding
his
head
let
droop
and
again
closed
his
eye
first
the
members
the
council
thought
that
kutuzov
was
pretending
sleep
the
sounds
his
nose
emitted
during
the
reading
that
followed
proved
that
the
commander
chief
that
moment
was
absorbed
far
more
serious
matter
than
desire
show
his
contempt
for
the
dispositions
anything
else
was
engaged
satisfying
the
irresistible
human
need
for
sleep
really
was
asleep
weyrother
with
the
gesture
man
too
busy
lose
moment
glanced
kutuzov
and
having
convinced
himself
that
was
asleep
took
paper
and
loud
monotonous
voice
began
read
out
the
dispositions
for
the
impending
battle
under
heading
which
also
read
out
dispositions
for
attack
the
enemy
position
behind
kobelnitz
and
sokolnitz
november
the
dispositions
were
very
complicated
and
difficult
they
began
follows
the
enemy
left
wing
rests
wooded
hills
and
his
right
extends
along
kobelnitz
and
sokolnitz
behind
the
ponds
that
are
there
while
the
other
hand
with
our
left
wing
far
outflank
his
right
advantageous
attack
the
enemy
latter
wing
especially
occupy
the
villages
sokolnitz
and
kobelnitz
whereby
can
both
fall
his
flank
and
pursue
him
over
the
plain
between
schlappanitz
and
the
thuerassa
forest
avoiding
the
defiles
schlappanitz
and
bellowitz
which
cover
the
enemy
front
for
this
object
necessary
that
the
first
column
marches
the
second
column
marches
the
third
column
marches
and
read
weyrother
the
generals
seemed
listen
reluctantly
the
difficult
dispositions
the
tall
fair
haired
general
buxhowden
stood
leaning
his
back
against
the
wall
his
eyes
fixed
burning
candle
and
seemed
not
listen
even
wish
thought
listen
exactly
opposite
weyrother
with
his
glistening
wide
open
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
his
mustache
twisted
upwards
sat
the
ruddy
miloradovich
military
pose
his
elbows
turned
outwards
his
hands
his
knees
and
his
shoulders
raised
remained
stubbornly
silent
gazing
weyrother
face
and
only
turned
away
his
eyes
when
the
austrian
chief
staff
finished
reading
then
miloradovich
looked
round
significantly
the
other
generals
but
one
could
not
tell
from
that
significant
look
whether
agreed
disagreed
and
was
satisfied
not
with
the
arrangements
next
weyrother
sat
count
langeron
who
with
subtle
smile
that
never
left
his
typically
southern
french
face
during
the
whole
time
the
reading
gazed
his
delicate
fingers
which
rapidly
twirled
its
corners
gold
snuffbox
which
was
portrait
the
middle
one
the
longest
sentences
stopped
the
rotary
motion
the
snuffbox
raised
his
head
and
with
inimical
politeness
lurking
the
corners
his
thin
lips
interrupted
weyrother
wishing
say
something
but
the
austrian
general
continuing
read
frowned
angrily
and
jerked
his
elbows
say
you
can
tell
your
views
later
but
now
good
look
the
map
and
listen
langeron
lifted
his
eyes
with
expression
perplexity
turned
round
miloradovich
seeking
explanation
but
meeting
the
latter
impressive
but
meaningless
gaze
drooped
his
eyes
sadly
and
again
took
twirling
his
snuffbox
geography
lesson
muttered
himself
but
loud
enough
heard
przebyszewski
with
respectful
but
dignified
politeness
held
his
hand
his
ear
toward
weyrother
with
the
air
man
absorbed
attention
dohkturov
little
man
sat
opposite
weyrother
with
assiduous
and
modest
mien
and
stooping
over
the
outspread
map
conscientiously
studied
the
dispositions
and
the
unfamiliar
locality
asked
weyrother
several
times
repeat
words
had
not
clearly
heard
and
the
difficult
names
villages
weyrother
complied
and
dohkturov
noted
them
down
when
the
reading
which
lasted
more
than
hour
was
over
langeron
again
brought
his
snuffbox
rest
and
without
looking
weyrother
anyone
particular
began
say
how
difficult
was
carry
out
such
plan
which
the
enemy
position
was
assumed
known
whereas
was
perhaps
not
known
since
the
enemy
was
movement
langeron
objections
were
valid
but
was
obvious
that
their
chief
aim
was
show
general
weyrother
who
had
read
his
dispositions
with
much
self
confidence
were
addressing
school
children
that
had
not
with
fools
but
with
men
who
could
teach
him
something
military
matters
when
the
monotonous
sound
weyrother
voice
ceased
kutuzov
opened
his
eye
miller
wakes
when
the
soporific
drone
the
mill
wheel
interrupted
listened
what
langeron
said
remarking
you
are
still
that
silly
business
quickly
closed
his
eye
again
and
let
his
head
sink
still
lower
langeron
trying
virulently
possible
sting
weyrother
vanity
author
the
military
plan
argued
that
bonaparte
might
easily
attack
instead
being
attacked
and
render
the
whole
this
plan
perfectly
worthless
weyrother
met
all
objections
with
firm
and
contemptuous
smile
evidently
prepared
beforehand
meet
all
objections
they
what
they
might
could
attack
would
have
done
today
said
you
think
powerless
said
langeron
has
forty
thousand
men
most
replied
weyrother
with
the
smile
doctor
whom
old
wife
wishes
explain
the
treatment
case
that
case
inviting
his
doom
awaiting
our
attack
said
langeron
with
subtly
ironical
smile
again
glancing
round
for
support
miloradovich
who
was
near
him
but
miloradovich
was
that
moment
evidently
thinking
anything
rather
than
what
the
generals
were
disputing
about
foi
said
tomorrow
shall
see
all
that
the
battlefield
weyrother
again
gave
that
smile
which
seemed
say
that
him
was
strange
and
ridiculous
meet
objections
from
russian
generals
and
have
prove
them
what
had
not
merely
convinced
himself
but
had
also
convinced
the
sovereign
emperors
the
enemy
has
quenched
his
fires
and
continual
noise
heard
from
his
camp
said
what
does
that
mean
either
retreating
which
the
only
thing
need
fear
changing
his
position
smiled
ironically
but
even
also
took
position
the
thuerassa
merely
saves
great
deal
trouble
and
all
our
arrangements
the
minutest
detail
remain
the
same
how
that
began
prince
andrew
who
had
for
long
been
waiting
opportunity
express
his
doubts
kutuzov
here
woke
coughed
heavily
and
looked
round
the
generals
gentlemen
the
dispositions
for
tomorrow
rather
for
today
for
past
midnight
cannot
now
altered
said
you
have
heard
them
and
shall
all
our
duty
but
before
battle
there
nothing
more
important
paused
than
have
good
sleep
moved
rise
the
generals
bowed
and
retired
was
past
midnight
prince
andrew
went
out
the
council
war
which
prince
andrew
had
not
been
able
express
his
opinion
had
hoped
left
him
vague
and
uneasy
impression
whether
dolgorukov
and
weyrother
kutuzov
langeron
and
the
others
who
did
not
approve
the
plan
attack
were
right
did
not
know
but
was
really
not
possible
for
kutuzov
state
his
views
plainly
the
emperor
possible
that
account
court
and
personal
considerations
tens
thousands
lives
and
life
life
thought
must
risked
yes
very
likely
that
shall
killed
tomorrow
thought
and
suddenly
this
thought
death
whole
series
most
distant
most
intimate
memories
rose
his
imagination
remembered
his
last
parting
from
his
father
and
his
wife
remembered
the
days
when
first
loved
her
thought
her
pregnancy
and
felt
sorry
for
her
and
for
himself
and
nervously
emotional
and
softened
mood
went
out
the
hut
which
was
billeted
with
nesvitski
and
began
walk
and
down
before
the
night
was
foggy
and
through
the
fog
the
moonlight
gleamed
mysteriously
yes
tomorrow
tomorrow
thought
tomorrow
everything
may
over
for
all
these
memories
will
more
none
them
will
have
any
meaning
for
tomorrow
perhaps
even
certainly
have
presentiment
that
for
the
first
time
shall
have
show
all
can
and
his
fancy
pictured
the
battle
its
loss
the
concentration
fighting
one
point
and
the
hesitation
all
the
commanders
and
then
that
happy
moment
that
toulon
for
which
had
long
waited
presents
itself
him
last
firmly
and
clearly
expresses
his
opinion
kutuzov
weyrother
and
the
emperors
all
are
struck
the
justness
his
views
but
one
undertakes
carry
them
out
takes
regiment
division
stipulates
that
one
interfere
with
his
arrangements
leads
his
division
the
decisive
point
and
gains
the
victory
alone
but
death
and
suffering
suggested
another
voice
prince
andrew
however
did
not
answer
that
voice
and
went
dreaming
his
triumphs
the
dispositions
for
the
next
battle
are
planned
him
alone
nominally
only
adjutant
kutuzov
staff
but
does
everything
alone
the
next
battle
won
him
alone
kutuzov
removed
and
appointed
well
and
then
asked
the
other
voice
before
that
you
are
not
ten
times
wounded
killed
betrayed
well
what
then
well
then
prince
andrew
answered
himself
don
know
what
will
happen
and
don
want
know
and
can
but
want
this
want
glory
want
known
men
want
loved
them
not
fault
that
want
and
want
nothing
but
that
and
live
only
for
that
yes
for
that
alone
shall
never
tell
anyone
but
god
what
love
nothing
but
fame
and
men
esteem
death
wounds
the
loss
family
fear
nothing
and
precious
and
dear
many
persons
are
father
sister
wife
those
dearest
yet
dreadful
and
unnatural
seems
would
give
them
all
once
for
moment
glory
triumph
over
men
love
from
men
don
know
and
never
shall
know
for
the
love
these
men
here
thought
listened
voices
kutuzov
courtyard
the
voices
were
those
the
orderlies
who
were
packing
one
voice
probably
coachman
was
teasing
kutuzov
old
cook
whom
prince
andrew
knew
and
who
was
called
tit
was
saying
tit
say
tit
well
returned
the
old
man
tit
thresh
bit
said
the
wag
the
devil
called
out
voice
drowned
the
laughter
the
orderlies
and
servants
all
the
same
love
and
value
nothing
but
triumph
over
them
all
value
this
mystic
power
and
glory
that
floating
here
above
this
mist
chapter
xiii
that
same
night
rostov
was
with
platoon
skirmishing
duty
front
bagration
detachment
his
hussars
were
placed
along
the
line
couples
and
himself
rode
along
the
line
trying
master
the
sleepiness
that
kept
coming
over
him
enormous
space
with
our
army
campfires
dimly
glowing
the
fog
could
seen
behind
him
front
him
was
misty
darkness
rostov
could
see
nothing
peer
would
into
that
foggy
distance
now
something
gleamed
gray
now
there
was
something
black
now
little
lights
seemed
glimmer
where
the
enemy
ought
now
fancied
was
only
something
his
own
eyes
his
eyes
kept
closing
and
his
fancy
appeared
now
the
emperor
now
denisov
and
now
moscow
memories
and
again
hurriedly
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
close
before
him
the
head
and
ears
the
horse
was
riding
and
sometimes
when
came
within
six
paces
them
the
black
figures
hussars
but
the
distance
was
still
the
same
misty
darkness
why
not
might
easily
happen
thought
rostov
that
the
emperor
will
meet
and
give
order
would
any
other
officer
say
and
find
out
what
there
there
are
many
stories
his
getting
know
officer
just
such
chance
way
and
attaching
him
himself
what
gave
place
near
him
how
would
guard
him
how
would
tell
him
the
truth
how
would
unmask
his
deceivers
and
order
realize
vividly
his
love
devotion
the
sovereign
rostov
pictured
himself
enemy
deceitful
german
whom
would
not
only
kill
with
pleasure
but
whom
would
slap
the
face
before
the
emperor
suddenly
distant
shout
aroused
him
started
and
opened
his
eyes
where
yes
the
skirmishing
line
pass
and
watchword
shaft
olmutz
what
nuisance
that
our
squadron
will
reserve
tomorrow
thought
ask
leave
the
front
this
may
only
chance
seeing
the
emperor
won
long
now
before
off
duty
take
another
turn
and
when
get
back
the
general
and
ask
him
readjusted
himself
the
saddle
and
touched
his
horse
ride
once
more
round
his
hussars
seemed
him
that
was
getting
lighter
the
left
saw
sloping
descent
lit
and
facing
black
knoll
that
seemed
steep
wall
this
knoll
there
was
white
patch
that
rostov
could
not
all
make
out
was
glade
the
wood
lit
the
moon
some
unmelted
snow
some
white
houses
even
thought
something
moved
that
white
spot
expect

surprised
when
tell
her
how
seen
the
emperor
natasha
take
sabretache
keep
the
right
your
honor
there
are
bushes
here
came
the
voice
hussar
past
whom
rostov
was
riding
the
act
falling
asleep
rostov
lifted
his
head
that
had
sunk
almost
his
horse
mane
and
pulled
beside
the
hussar
was
succumbing
irresistible
youthful
childish
drowsiness
but
what
was
thinking
mustn
forget
how
shall
speak
the
emperor
that
not
that
tomorrow
yes
natasha
sabretache
saber
them
whom
the
hussars
the
hussars
with
mustaches
along
the
tverskaya
street
rode
the
hussar
with
mustaches
thought
about
him
too
just
opposite
guryev
house
old
guryev
but
denisov
fine
fellow
but
that
all
nonsense
the
chief
thing
that
the
emperor
here
how
looked
and
wished
say
something
but
dared
not
was
who
dared
not
but
that
nonsense
the
chief
thing
not
forget
the
important
thing
was
thinking
yes
tasha
sabretache
yes
yes
that
right
and
his
head
once
more
sank
his
horse
neck
all
once
seemed
him
that
was
being
fired
what
what
what
cut
them
down
what
said
rostov
waking
the
moment
opened
his
eyes
heard
front
him
where
the
enemy
was
the
long
drawn
shouts
thousands
voices
his
horse
and
the
horse
the
hussar
near
him
pricked
their
ears
these
shouts
over
there
where
the
shouting
came
from
fire
flared
and
went
out
again
then
another
and
all
along
the
french
line
the
hill
fires
flared
and
the
shouting
grew
louder
and
louder
rostov
could
hear
the
sound
french
words
but
could
not
distinguish
them
the
din
many
voices
was
too
great
all
could
hear
was
ahahah
and
rrrr
what
that
what
you
make
said
rostov
the
hussar
beside
him
that
must
the
enemy
camp
the
hussar
did
not
reply
why
don
you
hear
rostov
asked
again
after
waiting
for
reply
who
can
tell
your
honor
replied
the
hussar
reluctantly
from
the
direction
must
the
enemy
repeated
rostov
may
may
nothing
muttered
the
hussar
dark
steady
cried
his
fidgeting
horse
rostov
horse
was
also
getting
restive
pawed
the
frozen
ground
pricking
its
ears
the
noise
and
looking
the
lights
the
shouting
grew
still
louder
and
merged
into
general
roar
that
only
army
several
thousand
men
could
produce
the
lights
spread
farther
and
farther
probably
along
the
line
the
french
camp
rostov
longer
wanted
sleep
the
gay
triumphant
shouting
the
enemy
army
had
stimulating
effect
him
vive
empereur
empereur
now
heard
distinctly
they
can
far
off
probably
just
beyond
the
stream
said
the
hussar
beside
him
the
hussar
only
sighed
without
replying
and
coughed
angrily
the
sound
horse
hoofs
approaching
trot
along
the
line
hussars
was
heard
and
out
the
foggy
darkness
the
figure
sergeant
hussars
suddenly
appeared
looming
huge
elephant
your
honor
the
generals
said
the
sergeant
riding
rostov
rostov
still
looking
round
toward
the
fires
and
the
shouts
rode
with
the
sergeant
meet
some
mounted
men
who
were
riding
along
the
line
one
was
white
horse
prince
bagration
and
prince
dolgorukov
with
their
adjutants
had
come
witness
the
curious
phenomenon
the
lights
and
shouts
the
enemy
camp
rostov
rode
bagration
reported
him
and
then
joined
the
adjutants
listening
what
the
generals
were
saying
believe
said
prince
dolgorukov
addressing
bagration
nothing
but
trick
has
retreated
and
ordered
the
rearguard
kindle
fires
and
make
noise
deceive
hardly
said
bagration
saw
them
this
evening
that
knoll
they
had
retreated
they
would
have
withdrawn
from
that
too
officer
said
bagration
rostov
are
the
enemy
skirmishers
still
there
they
were
there
this
evening
but
now
don
know
your
excellency
shall
with
some
hussars
see
replied
rostov
bagration
stopped
and
before
replying
tried
see
rostov
face
the
mist
well
and
see
said
after
pause
yes
sir
rostov
spurred
his
horse
called
sergeant
fedchenko
and
two
other
hussars
told
them
follow
him
and
trotted
downhill
the
direction
from
which
the
shouting
came
felt
both
frightened
and
pleased
riding
alone
with
three
hussars
into
that
mysterious
and
dangerous
misty
distance
where
one
had
been
before
him
bagration
called
him
from
the
hill
not
beyond
the
stream
but
rostov
pretended
not
hear
him
and
did
not
stop
but
rode
and
continually
mistaking
bushes
for
trees
and
gullies
for
men
and
continually
discovering
his
mistakes
having
descended
the
hill
trot
longer
saw
either
our
own
the
enemy
fires
but
heard
the
shouting
the
french
more
loudly
and
distinctly
the
valley
saw
before
him
something
like
river
but
when
reached
found
was
road
having
come
out
onto
the
road
reined
his
horse
hesitating
whether
ride
along
cross
and
ride
over
the
black
field
the
hillside
keep
the
road
which
gleamed
white
the
mist
would
have
been
safer
because
would
easier
see
people
coming
along
follow
said
crossed
the
road
and
began
riding
the
hill
gallop
toward
the
point
where
the
french
pickets
had
been
standing
that
evening
your
honor
there
cried
one
the
hussars
behind
him
and
before
rostov
had
time
make
out
what
the
black
thing
was
that
had
suddenly
appeared
the
fog
there
was
flash
followed
report
and
bullet
whizzing
high
the
mist
with
plaintive
sound
passed
out
hearing
another
musket
missed
fire
but
flashed
the
pan
rostov
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
back
four
more
reports
followed
intervals
and
the
bullets
passed
somewhere
the
fog
singing
different
tones
rostov
reined
his
horse
whose
spirits
had
risen
like
his
own
the
firing
and
went
back
footpace
well
some
more
some
more
merry
voice
was
saying
his
soul
but
more
shots
came
only
when
approaching
bagration
did
rostov
let
his
horse
gallop
again
and
with
his
hand
the
salute
rode
the
general
dolgorukov
was
still
insisting
that
the
french
had
retreated
and
had
only
lit
fires
deceive
what
does
that
prove
was
saying
rostov
rode
they
might
retreat
and
leave
the
pickets
plain
that
they
have
not
all
gone
yet
prince
said
bagration
wait
till
tomorrow
morning
find
out
everything
tomorrow
the
picket
still
the
hill
your
excellency
just
where
was
the
evening
reported
rostov
stooping
forward
with
his
hand
the
salute
and
unable
repress
the
smile
delight
induced
his
ride
and
especially
the
sound
the
bullets
very
good
very
good
said
bagration
thank
you

likely
may
sent
with
some
message
the
emperor
thought
rostov
thank
god
the
fires
and
shouting

enemy

were
occasioned
the
fact
that
while

around
them
the
fog
had
grown
dense
that
though
was
growing
light
they
could
not
see
ten
paces
ahead
bushes
looked
like
gigantic
trees
and
level
ground
like
cliffs
and
slopes
anywhere
any
side
one
might
encounter
enemy
invisible
ten
paces
off
but
the
columns
advanced
for
long
time
always
the
same
fog
descending
and
ascending
hills
avoiding
gardens
and
enclosures
going
over
new
and
unknown
ground
and
nowhere
encountering
the
enemy
the
contrary
the
soldiers
became
aware
that
front
behind
and
all
sides
other
russian
columns
were
moving
the
same
direction
every
soldier
felt
glad
know
that
the
unknown
place
where
was
going
many
more
our
men
were
going
too
there
now
the
kurskies
have
also
gone
past
was
being
said
the
ranks
wonderful
what
lot
our
troops
have
gathered
lads
last
night
looked
the
campfires
and
there
was
end
them
regular
moscow
though
none
the
column
commanders
rode
the
ranks
talked
the
men
the
commanders
saw
the
council
war
were
out
humor
and
dissatisfied
with
the
affair
and
did
not
exert
themselves
cheer
the
men
but
merely
carried
out
the
orders
yet
the
troops
marched
gaily
they
always
when
going
into
action
especially
attack
but
when
they
had
marched
for
about
hour
the
dense
fog
the
greater
part
the
men
had
halt
and
unpleasant
consciousness
some
dislocation
and
blunder
spread
through
the
ranks
how
such
consciousness
communicated
very
difficult
define
but
certainly
communicated
very
surely
and
flows
rapidly
imperceptibly
and
irrepressibly
water
does
creek
had
the
russian
army
been
alone
without
any
allies
might
perhaps
have
been
long
time
before
this
consciousness
mismanagement
became
general
conviction
but
was
the
disorder
was
readily
and
naturally
attributed
the
stupid
germans
and
everyone
was
convinced
that
dangerous
muddle
had
been
occasioned
the
sausage
eaters
why
have
stopped
the
way
blocked
have
already
come
against
the
french
one
can
hear
them
they
firing
had
they
were
hurry
enough
start
and
now
here
stand
the
middle
field
without
rhyme
reason
all
those
damned
germans
muddling
what
stupid
devils
yes
send
them
front
but
fear
they
crowding
behind
and
now
here
stand
hungry
say
shall
soon
clear
they
say
the
cavalry
are
blocking
the
way
said
officer
those
damned
germans
they
don
know
their
own
country
said
another
what
division
are
you
shouted
adjutant
riding
the
eighteenth
then
why
are
you
here
you
should
have
gone
long
ago
now
you
won
get
there
till
evening
what
stupid
orders
they
don
themselves
know
what
they
are
doing
said
the
officer
and
rode
off
then
general
rode
past
shouting
something
angrily
not
russian
tafa
lafa
but
what
jabbering
one
can
make
out
said
soldier
mimicking
the
general
who
had
ridden
away
shoot
them
the
scoundrels
were
ordered
the
place
before
nine
but
haven
got
halfway
fine
orders
was
being
repeated
different
sides
and
the
feeling
energy
with
which
the
troops
had
started
began
turn
into
vexation
and
anger
the
stupid
arrangements
and
the
germans
the
cause
the
confusion
was
that
while
the
austrian
cavalry
was
moving
toward
our
left
flank
the
higher
command
found
that
our
center
was
too
far
separated
from
our
right
flank
and
the
cavalry
were
all
ordered
turn
back
the
right
several
thousand
cavalry
crossed
front
the
infantry
who
had
wait
the
front
altercation
occurred
between
austrian
guide
and
russian
general
the
general
shouted
demand
that
the
cavalry
should
halted
the
austrian
argued
that
not
but
the
higher
command
was
blame
the
troops
meanwhile
stood
growing
listless
and
dispirited
after
hour
delay
they
last
moved
descending
the
hill
the
fog
that
was
dispersing
the
hill
lay
still
more
densely
below
where
they
were
descending
front
the
fog
shot
was
heard
and
then
another
first
irregularly
varying
intervals
trata
tat
and
then
more
and
more
regularly
and
rapidly
and
the
action
the
goldbach
stream
began
not
expecting
come
the
enemy
down
the
stream
and
having
stumbled
him
the
fog
hearing
encouraging
word
from
their
commanders
and
with
consciousness
being
too
late
spreading
through
the
ranks
and
above
all
being
unable
see
anything
front
around
them
the
thick
fog
the
russians
exchanged
shots
with
the
enemy
lazily
and
advanced
and
again
halted
receiving
timely
orders
from
the
officers
adjutants
who
wandered
about
the
fog
those
unknown
surroundings
unable
find
their
own
regiments
this
way
the
action
began
for
the
first
second
and
third
columns
which
had
gone
down
into
the
valley
the
fourth
column
with
which
kutuzov
was
stood
the
pratzen
heights
below
where
the
fight
was
beginning
there
was
still
thick
fog
the
higher
ground
was
clearing
but
nothing
could
seen
what
was
going
front
whether
all
the
enemy
forces
were
supposed
six
miles
away
whether
they
were
near
that
sea
mist
one
knew
till
after
eight
clock
was
nine
clock
the
morning
the
fog
lay
unbroken
like
sea
down
below
but
higher
the
village
schlappanitz
where
napoleon
stood
with
his
marshals
around
him
was
quite
light
above
him
was
clear
blue
sky
and
the
sun
vast
orb
quivered
like
huge
hollow
crimson
float
the
surface
that
milky
sea
mist
the
whole
french
army
and
even
napoleon
himself
with
his
staff
were
not
the
far
side
the
streams
and
hollows
sokolnitz
and
schlappanitz
beyond
which
intended
take
our
position
and
begin
the
action
but
were
this
side
close
our
own
forces
that
napoleon
with
the
naked
eye
could
distinguish
mounted
man
from
one
foot
napoleon
the
blue
cloak
which
had
worn
his
italian
campaign
sat
his
small
gray
arab
horse
little
front
his
marshals
gazed
silently
the
hills
which
seemed
rise
out
the
sea
mist
and
which
the
russian
troops
were
moving
the
distance
and
listened
the
sounds
firing
the
valley
not
single
muscle
his
face
which
those
days
was
still
thin
moved
his
gleaming
eyes
were
fixed
intently
one
spot
his
predictions
were
being
justified
part
the
russian
force
had
already
descended
into
the
valley
toward
the
ponds
and
lakes
and
part
were
leaving
these
pratzen
heights
which
intended
attack
and
regarded
the
key
the
position
saw
over
the
mist
that
hollow
between
two
hills
near
the
village
pratzen
the
russian
columns
their
bayonets
glittering
were
moving
continuously
one
direction
toward
the
valley
and
disappearing
one
after
another
into
the
mist
from
information
had
received
the
evening
before
from
the
sound
wheels
and
footsteps
heard
the
outposts
during
the
night
the
disorderly
movement
the
russian
columns
and
from
all
indications
saw
clearly
that
the
allies
believed
him
far
away
front
them
and
that
the
columns
moving
near
pratzen
constituted
the
center
the
russian
army
and
that
that
center
was
already
sufficiently
weakened
successfully
attacked
but
still
did
not
begin
the
engagement
today
was
great
day
for
him
the
anniversary
his
coronation
before
dawn
had
slept
for
few
hours
and
refreshed
vigorous
and
good
spirits
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
out
into
the
field
that
happy
mood
which
everything
seems
possible
and
everything
succeeds
sat
motionless
looking
the
heights
visible
above
the
mist
and
his
cold
face
wore
that
special
look
confident
self
complacent
happiness
that
one
sees
the
face
boy
happily
love
the
marshals
stood
behind
him
not
venturing
distract
his
attention
looked
now
the
pratzen
heights
now
the
sun
floating
out
the
mist
when
the
sun
had
entirely
emerged
from
the
fog
and
fields
and

were
aglow
with
dazzling
light
had
only
awaited
this

the

drew
the

from
his
shapely
white
hand
made
sign
with
the
marshals
and
ordered
the
action
begin
the
marshals
accompanied
adjutants
galloped
off
different
directions
and
few
minutes
later
the
chief
forces
the
french
army
moved
rapidly
toward
those
pratzen
heights
which
were
being
more
and
more
denuded

the

was
firmly
convinced
that
this

his

far
they
could

anyone
our

his

which
obviously
could
not

out
was

now
entering
into

prince
andrew
considered
possible

formed

such

call
for
his

and
decision
the
left
down

the

fire
unseen

was
there
prince
andrew
thought
the
fight
would
concentrate
there

encounter

and
there
thought
shall
sent
with

and
there
standard
hand
shall
forward
and
break
whatever

could
not
look
calmly
the
standards
the
passing

seeing

kept
thinking
that

the
very
standard
with
which
shall
lead
the
army
the
morning
all
that
was
left
the
night
mist
the
heights
was
hoar
frost
now
turning
dew
but
the
valleys
still
lay
like
milk
white
sea
nothing
was
visible
the
valley
the
left
into
which
our
troops
had
descended
and
from
whence
came
the
sounds
firing
above
the
heights
was
the
dark
clear
sky
and
the
right
the
vast
orb
the
sun
front
far
off
the
farther
shore
that
sea
mist
some
wooded
hills
were
discernible
and
was
there
the
enemy
probably
was
for
something
could
descried
the
right
the
guards
were
entering
the
misty
region
with
sound
hoofs
and
wheels
and
now
and
then
gleam
bayonets
the
left
beyond
the
village
similar
masses
cavalry
came
and
disappeared
the
sea
mist
front
and
behind
moved
infantry
the
commander
chief
was
standing
the
end
the
village
letting
the
troops
pass
him
that
morning
kutuzov
seemed
worn
and
irritable
the
infantry
passing
before
him
came
halt
without
any
command
being
given
apparently
obstructed
something
front
order
them
form
into
battalion
columns
and
round
the
village
said
angrily
general
who
had
ridden
don
you
understand
your
excellency
dear
sir
that
you
must
not
defile
through
narrow
village
streets
when
are
marching
against
the
enemy
intended
form
them
beyond
the
village
your
excellency
answered
the
general
kutuzov
laughed
bitterly
you
make
fine
thing
deploying
sight
the
enemy
very
fine
the
enemy
still
far
away
your
excellency
according
the
dispositions
the
dispositions
exclaimed
kutuzov
bitterly
who
told
you
that
kindly
you
are
ordered
yes
sir
dear
fellow
nesvitski
whispered
prince
andrew
the
old
man
surly
dog
austrian
officer
white
uniform
with
green
plumes
his
hat
galloped
kutuzov
and
asked
the
emperor
name
had
the
fourth
column
advanced
into
action
kutuzov
turned
round
without
answering
and
his
eye
happened
fall
upon
prince
andrew
who
was
beside
him
seeing
him
kutuzov
malevolent
and
caustic
expression
softened
admitting
that
what
was
being
done
was
not
his
adjutant
fault
and
still
not
answering
the
austrian
adjutant
addressed
bolkonski
dear
fellow
and
see
whether
the
third
division
has
passed
the
village
tell
stop
and
await
orders
hardly
had
prince
andrew
started
than
stopped
him
and
ask
whether
sharpshooters
have
been
posted
added
what
are
they
doing
what
are
they
doing
murmured
himself
still
not
replying
the
austrian
prince
andrew
galloped
off
execute
the
order
overtaking
the
battalions
that
continued
advance
stopped
the
third
division
and
convinced
himself
that
there
really
were
sharpshooters
front
our
columns
the
colonel
the
head
the
regiment
was
much
surprised
the
commander
chief
order
throw
out
skirmishers
had
felt
perfectly
sure
that
there
were
other
troops
front
him
and
that
the
enemy
must
least
six
miles
away
there
was
really
nothing
seen
front
except
barren
descent
hidden
dense
mist
having
given
orders
the
commander
chief
name
rectify
this
omission
prince
andrew
galloped
back
kutuzov
still
the
same
place
his
stout
body
resting
heavily
the
saddle
with
the
lassitude
age
sat
yawning
wearily
with
closed
eyes
the
troops
were
longer
moving
but
stood
with
the
butts
their
muskets
the
ground
all
right
all
right
said
prince
andrew
and
turned
general
who
watch
hand
was
saying
was
time
they
started
all
the
left
flank
columns
had
already
descended
plenty
time
your
excellency
muttered
kutuzov
the
midst
yawn
plenty
time
repeated
just
then
distance
behind
kutuzov
was
heard
the
sound
regiments
saluting
and
this
sound
rapidly
came
nearer
along
the
whole
extended
line
the
advancing
russian
columns
evidently
the
person
they
were
greeting
was
riding
quickly
when
the
soldiers
the
regiment
front
which
kutuzov
was
standing
began
shout
rode
little
one
side
and
looked
round
with
frown
along
the
road
from
pratzen
galloped
what
looked
like
squadron
horsemen
various
uniforms
two
them
rode
side
side
front
full
gallop
one
black
uniform
with
white
plumes
his
hat
rode
bobtailed
chestnut
horse
the
other
who
was
white
uniform
rode
black
one
these
were
the
two
emperors
followed
their
suites
kutuzov
affecting
the
manners
old
soldier
the
front
gave
the
command
attention
and
rode
the
emperors
with
salute
his
whole
appearance
and
manner
were
suddenly
transformed
put
the
air
subordinate
who
obeys
without
reasoning
with
affectation
respect
which
evidently
struck
alexander
unpleasantly
rode
and
saluted
this
unpleasant
impression
merely
flitted
over
the
young
and
happy
face
the
emperor
like
cloud
haze
across
clear
sky
and
vanished
after
his
illness
looked
rather
thinner
that
day
than
the
field
olmutz
where
bolkonski
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
abroad
but
there
was
still
the
same
bewitching
combination
majesty
and
mildness
his
fine
gray
eyes
and
his
delicate
lips
the
same
capacity
for
varying
expression
and
the
same
prevalent
appearance
goodhearted
innocent
youth
the
olmutz
review
had
seemed
more
majestic
here
seemed
brighter
and
more
energetic
was
slightly
flushed
after
galloping
two
miles
and
reining
his
horse
sighed
restfully
and
looked
round
the
faces
his
suite
young
and
animated
his
own
czartoryski
novosiltsev
prince
volkonsky
strogonov
and
the
others
all
richly
dressed
gay
young
men
splendid
well
groomed
fresh
only
slightly
heated
horses
exchanging
remarks
and
smiling
had
stopped
behind
the
emperor
the
emperor
francis
rosy
long
faced
young
man
sat
very
erect
his
handsome
black
horse
looking
about
him
leisurely
and
preoccupied
manner
beckoned
one
his
white
adjutants
and
asked
some
question
most
likely
asking
what
clock
they
started
thought
prince
andrew
watching
his
old
acquaintance
with
smile
could
not
repress
recalled
his
reception
brunn
the
emperors
suite
were
the
picked
young
orderly
officers
the
guard
and
line
regiments
russian
and
austrian
among
them
were
grooms
leading
the
tsar
beautiful
relay
horses
covered
with
embroidered
cloths
when
window
opened
whiff
fresh
air
from
the
fields
enters
stuffy
room
whiff
youthfulness
energy
and
confidence
success
reached
kutuzov
cheerless
staff
with
the
galloping
advent
all
these
brilliant
young
men
why
aren
you
beginning
michael
ilarionovich
said
the
emperor
alexander
hurriedly
kutuzov
glancing
courteously
the
same
time
the
emperor
francis
waiting
your
majesty
answered
kutuzov
bending
forward
respectfully
the
emperor
frowning
slightly
bent
his
ear
forward
had
not
quite
heard
waiting
your
majesty
repeated
kutuzov
prince
andrew
noted
that
kutuzov
upper
lip
twitched
unnaturally
said
the
word
waiting
not
all
the
columns
have
formed
yet
your
majesty
the
tsar
heard
but
obviously
did
not
like
the
reply
shrugged
his
rather
round
shoulders
and
glanced
novosiltsev
who
was
near
him
complaining
kutuzov
you
know
michael
ilarionovich
are
not
the
empress
field
where
parade
does
not
begin
till
all
the
troops
are
assembled
said
the
tsar
with
another
glance
the
emperor
francis
inviting
him
not
join
least
listen
what
was
saying
but
the
emperor
francis
continued
look
about
him
and
did
not
listen
that
just
why
not
begin
sire
said
kutuzov
resounding
voice
apparently
preclude
the
possibility
not
being
heard
and
again
something
his
face
twitched
that
just
why
not
begin
sire
because
are
not
parade
and
not
the
empress
field
said
clearly
and
distinctly
the
emperor
suite
all
exchanged
rapid
looks
that
expressed
dissatisfaction
and
reproach
old
though
may
should
not
certainly
should
not
speak
like
that
their
glances
seemed
say
the

looked
intently
and
observantly
into
kutuzov
eye
waiting

whether
would
say
anything
more
but
kutuzov
with
respectfully
bowed
head
seemed
also
waiting
the
silence
lasted
for
about
minute
however
you
command
your
majesty
said
kutuzov
lifting
his
head
and
again
assuming
his
former
tone
dull
unreasoning
but
submissive
general
touched
his
horse
and
having
called
miloradovich
the
commander
the

gave
him
the
order

the

again
began

and
enormous

his

kutuzov
accompanied
his
adjutants
rode
walking
pace
behind
the
carabineers
when
had
gone
less
than
half
mile
the
rear
the
column
stopped
solitary
deserted
house
that
had
probably
once
been
inn
where
two
roads
parted
both
them
led
downhill
and
troops
were
marching
along
both
the
fog
had
begun
clear
and
enemy
troops
were
already
dimly
visible
about
mile
and
half
off
the
opposite
heights
down
below
the
left
the
firing
became
more
distinct
kutuzov
had
stopped
and
was
speaking
austrian
general
prince
andrew
who
was
little
behind
looking
them
turned
adjutant
ask
him
for

glass

said
this
adjutant
looking
not
the

the
distance
but
down
the
hill
before
him
the
french
the
two
generals
and
the
adjutant
took
hold
the
field
glass
trying
snatch
from
one
another
the
expression
all
their
faces
suddenly
changed
one
horror
the
french
were
supposed
mile
and
half
away
but
had
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
appeared
just
front
the
enemy
yes
see
for
certain
but
how
that
said
different
voices
with
the
naked
eye
prince
andrew
saw
below
them
the
right
not
more
than
five
hundred
paces
from
where
kutuzov
was
standing
dense
french
column
coming
meet
the
apsherons
here
the
decisive
moment
has
arrived
turn
has
come
thought
prince
andrew
and
striking
his
horse
rode
kutuzov
the
apsherons
must
stopped
your
excellency
cried
but
that
very
instant
cloud
smoke
spread
all
round
firing
was
heard
quite
close
hand
and
voice
naive
terror
barely
two
steps
from
prince
andrew
shouted
brothers
all
lost
and
this
command
everyone
began
run
confused
and
ever
increasing
crowds
were
running
back
where
five
minutes
before
the
troops
had
passed
the
emperors
not
only
would
have
been
difficult
stop
that
crowd
was
even
impossible
not
carried
back
with
oneself
bolkonski
only
tried
not
lose
touch
with
and
looked
around
bewildered
and
unable
grasp
what
was
happening
front
him
nesvitski
with
angry
face
red
and
unlike
himself
was
shouting
kutuzov
that
did
not
ride
away
once
would
certainly
taken
prisoner
kutuzov
remained
the
same
place
and
without
answering
drew
out
handkerchief
blood
was
flowing
from
his
cheek
prince
andrew
forced
his
way
him
you
are
wounded
asked
hardly
able
master
the
trembling
his
lower
jaw
the
wound
not
here
there
said
kutuzov
pressing
the
handkerchief
his
wounded
cheek
and
pointing
the
fleeing
soldiers
stop
them
shouted
and
the
same
moment
probably
realizing
that
was
impossible
stop
them
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
the
right
fresh
wave
the
flying
mob
caught
him
and
bore
him
back
with
the
troops
were
running
such
dense
mass
that
once
surrounded
them
was
difficult
get
out
again
one
was
shouting
get
why
are
you
hindering
another
the
same
place
turned
round
and
fired
the

third
was
striking
the

kutuzov
himself
rode
having
great
effort
got
away
the

from
that
flood

kutuzov
with
his

diminished
more
than
half
rode
toward

near
having
forced
his
way
out
the
crowd
fugitives
prince
andrew
trying
keep
near
kutuzov
saw
the
slope
the
hill
amid
the
smoke
russian
battery
that
was
still
firing
and
frenchmen
running
toward
higher
stood
some
russian
infantry
neither
moving
forward
protect
the
battery
nor
backward
with
the
fleeing
crowd
mounted
general
separated
himself
from
the
infantry
and
approached
kutuzov
kutuzov
suite
only
four
remained
they
were
all
pale
and
exchanged
looks
silence
stop
those
wretches
gasped
kutuzov
the
regimental
commander
pointing
the
flying
soldiers
but
that
instant
punish
him
for
those
words
bullets
flew
hissing
across
the
regiment
and
across
kutuzov
suite
like
flock
little
birds
the
french
had
attacked
the
battery
and
seeing
kutuzov
were
firing
him
after
this
volley
the
regimental
commander
clutched
his
leg
several
soldiers
fell
and
second
lieutenant
who
was
holding
the
flag
let
fall
from
his
hands
swayed
and
fell
but
caught
the
muskets
the
nearest
soldiers
the
soldiers
started
firing
without
orders
groaned
kutuzov
despairingly
and
looked
around
bolkonski
whispered
his
voice
trembling
from
consciousness
the
feebleness
age
bolkonski
whispered
pointing
the
disordered
battalion
and
the
enemy
what
that
but
before
had
finished
speaking
prince
andrew
feeling
tears
shame
and
anger
choking
him
had
already
leapt
from
his
horse
and
run
the
standard
forward
lads
shouted
voice
piercing
child
here
thought
seizing
the
staff
the
standard
and
hearing
with
pleasure
the
whistle
bullets
evidently
aimed
him
several
soldiers
fell
hurrah
shouted
prince
andrew
and
scarcely
able
hold
the
heavy
standard
ran
forward
with
full
confidence
that
the
whole
battalion
would
follow
him
and
really
only
ran
few
steps
alone
one
soldier
moved
and
then
another
and
soon
the
whole
battalion
ran
forward
shouting
hurrah
and
overtook
him
sergeant
the
battalion
ran
and
took
the
flag
that
was
swaying
from
its
weight
prince
andrew
hands
but
was
immediately
killed
prince
andrew
again
seized
the
standard
and
dragging
the
staff
ran
with
the
battalion
front
saw
our
artillerymen
some
whom
were
fighting
while
others
having
abandoned
their
guns
were
running
toward
him
also
saw
french
infantry
soldiers
who
were
seizing
the
artillery
horses
and
turning
the
guns
round
prince
andrew
and
the
battalion
were
already
within
twenty
paces
the
cannon
heard
the
whistle
bullets
above
him
unceasingly
and
right
and
left
him
soldiers
continually
groaned
and
dropped
but
did
not
look
them
looked
only
what
was
going
front
him
the
battery
now
saw
clearly
the
figure
red
haired
gunner
with
his
shako
knocked
awry
pulling
one
end
mop
while
french
soldier
tugged
the
other
could
distinctly
see
the
distraught
yet
angry
expression
the
faces
these
two
men
who
evidently
did
not
realize
what
they
were
doing
what
are
they
about
thought
prince
andrew
gazed
them
why
doesn
the
red
haired
gunner
run
away
unarmed
why
doesn
the
frenchman
stab
him
will
not
get
away
before
the
frenchman
remembers
his
bayonet
and
stabs
him
and
really
another
french
soldier
trailing
his
musket
ran
the
struggling
men
and
the
fate
the
red
haired
gunner
who
had
triumphantly
secured
the
mop
and
still
did
not
realize
what
awaited
him
was
about
decided
but
prince
andrew
did
not
see
how
ended
seemed
him
though
one
the
soldiers
near
him
hit
him
the
head
with
the
full
swing
bludgeon
hurt
little
but
the
worst
was
that
the
pain
distracted
him
and
prevented
his
seeing
what
had
been
looking
what
this
falling
legs
are
giving
way
thought
and
fell
his
back
opened
his
eyes
hoping
see
how
the
struggle
the
frenchmen
with
the
gunners
ended
whether
the
red
haired
gunner
had
been
killed
not
and
whether
the
cannon
had
been
captured
saved
but
saw
nothing
above
him
there
was
now
nothing
but
the
sky
the
lofty
sky
not
clear
yet
still
immeasurably
lofty
with
gray
clouds
gliding
slowly
across
how
quiet
peaceful
and
solemn
not
all
ran
thought
prince
andrew
not
ran
shouting
and
fighting
not
all
the
gunner
and
the
frenchman
with
frightened
and
angry
faces
struggled
for
the
mop
how
differently
those
clouds
glide
across
that
lofty
infinite
sky
how
was
did
not
see
that
lofty
sky
before
and
how
happy
have
found
last
yes
all
vanity
all
falsehood
except
that
infinite
sky
there
nothing
nothing
but
that
but
even
does
not
exist
there
nothing
but
quiet
and
peace

cast
his

the

rostov
breathless
with

and
should

with

said
dolgorukov
hurriedly
interrupting

being
relieved

rostov
had
managed
get
few
hours
sleep
before

and
felt
cheerful
bold
and
resolute
with
elasticity
movement
faith
his
good
fortune
and
generally
that
state
mind
which
makes
everything
seem
possible
pleasant
and
easy
all
his
wishes
were
being
fulfilled
that
morning
there
was
general
engagement
which
was
taking
part
more
than
that
was
orderly
the
bravest
general
and
still
more
was
going
with
message
kutuzov
perhaps
even
the
sovereign
himself
the
morning
was
bright
had
good
horse
under
him
and
his
heart
was
full
joy
and
happiness
receiving
the
order
gave
his
horse
the
rein
and
galloped
along
the
line
first
rode
along
the
line
bagration
troops
which
had
not
yet
advanced
into
action
but
were
standing
motionless
then
came
the
region
occupied
uvarov
cavalry
and
here
noticed
stir
and
signs
preparation
for
battle
having
passed
uvarov
cavalry
clearly
heard
the
sound
cannon
and
musketry
ahead
him
the
firing
grew
louder
and
louder
the
fresh
morning
air
were
now
heard
not
two
three
musket
shots
irregular
intervals
before
followed
one
two
cannon
shots
but
roll
volleys
musketry
from
the
slopes
the
hill
before
pratzen
interrupted
such
frequent
reports
cannon
that
sometimes
several
them
were
not
separated
from
one
another
but
merged
into
general
roar
could
see
puffs
musketry
smoke
that
seemed
chase
one
another
down
the
hillsides
and
clouds
cannon
smoke
rolling
spreading
and
mingling
with
one
another
could
also
the
gleam
bayonets
visible
through
the
smoke
make
out
moving
masses
infantry
and
narrow
lines
artillery
with
green
caissons
rostov
stopped
his
horse
for
moment
hillock
see
what
was
going
but
strain
his
attention
would
could
not
understand
make
out
anything
what
was
happening
there
the
smoke
men
some
sort
were
moving
about
front
and
behind
moved
lines
troops
but
why
whither
and
who
they
were
was
impossible
make
out
these
sights
and
sounds
had
depressing
intimidating
effect
him
the
contrary
they
stimulated
his
energy
and
determination
give
them
mentally
exclaimed
these
sounds
and
again
proceeded
gallop
along
the
line
penetrating
farther
and
farther
into
the
region
where
the
army
was
already
action
how
will
there
don
know
but
all
will
well
thought
rostov
after
passing
some
austrian
troops
noticed
that
the
next
part
the
line
the
guards
was
already
action
much
the
better
shall
see
close
thought
was
riding
almost
along
the
front
line
handful
men
came
galloping
toward
him
they
were
our
uhlans
who
with
disordered
ranks
were
returning
from
the
attack
rostov
got
out
their
way
involuntarily
noticed
that
one
them
was
bleeding
and
galloped
that
business
mine
thought
had
not
ridden
many
hundred
yards
after
that
before
saw
his
left
across
the
whole
width
the
field
enormous
mass
cavalry
brilliant
white
uniforms
mounted
black
horses
trotting
straight
toward
him
and
across
his
path
rostov
put
his
horse
full
gallop
get
out
the
way
these
men
and
would
have
got
clear
had
they
continued
the
same
speed
but
they
kept
increasing
their
pace
that
some
the
horses
were
already
galloping
rostov
heard
the
thud
their
hoofs
and
the
jingle
their
weapons
and
saw
their
horses
their
figures
and
even
their
faces
more
and
more
distinctly
they
were
our
horse
guards
advancing
attack
the
french
cavalry
that
was
coming
meet
them
the
horse
guards
were
galloping
but
still
holding
their
horses
rostov
could
already
see
their
faces
and
heard
the
command
charge
shouted
officer
who
was
urging
his
thoroughbred
full
speed
rostov
fearing
crushed
swept
into
the
attack
the
french
galloped
along
the
front
hard
his
horse
could
but
still
was
not
time
avoid
them
the
last
the
horse
guards
huge
pockmarked
fellow
frowned
angrily
seeing
rostov
before
him
with
whom
would
inevitably
collide
this
guardsman
would
certainly
have
bowled
rostov
and
his
bedouin
over
rostov
felt
himself
quite
tiny
and
weak
compared
these
gigantic
men
and
horses
had
not
occurred
rostov
flourish
his
whip
before
the
eyes
the
guardsman
horse
the
heavy
black
horse
sixteen
hands
high
shied
throwing
back
its
ears
but
the
pockmarked
guardsman
drove
his
huge
spurs
violently
and
the
horse
flourishing
its
tail
and
extending
its
neck
galloped
yet
faster
hardly
had
the
horse
guards
passed
rostov
before
heard
them
shout
hurrah
and
looking
back
saw
that
their
foremost
ranks
were
mixed
with
some
foreign
cavalry
with
red
epaulets
probably
french
could
see
nothing
more
for
immediately
afterwards
cannon
began
firing
from
somewhere
and
smoke
enveloped
everything
that
moment
the
horse
guards
having
passed
him
disappeared
the
smoke
rostov
hesitated
whether
gallop
after
them
where
was
sent
this
was
the
brilliant
charge
the
horse
guards
that
amazed
the
french
themselves
rostov
was
horrified
hear
later
that
all
that
mass
huge
and
handsome
men
all
those
brilliant
rich
youths
officers
and
cadets
who
had
galloped
past
him
their
thousand
ruble
horses
only
eighteen
were
left
after
the
charge
why
should
envy
them
chance
not
lost
and
maybe
shall
see
the
emperor
immediately
thought
rostov
and
galloped
when
came
level
with
the
foot
guards
noticed
that
about
them
and
around
them
cannon
balls
were
flying
which
was
aware
not
much
because
heard
their
sound
because
saw
uneasiness
the
soldiers
faces
and
unnatural
warlike
solemnity
those
the
officers
passing
behind
one
the
lines
regiment
foot
guards
heard
voice
calling
him
name
rostov
what
answered
not
recognizing
boris
say
been
the
front
line
our
regiment
attacked
said
boris
with
the
happy
smile
seen
the
faces
young
men
who
have
been
under
fire
for
the
first
time
rostov
stopped
have
you
said
well
how
did
drove
them
back
said
boris
with
animation
growing
talkative
can
you
imagine
and
began
describing
how
the
guards
having
taken
their
position
and
seeing
troops
before
them
thought
they
were
austrians
and
all
once
discovered
from
the
cannon
balls
discharged
those
troops
that
they
were
themselves
the
front
line
and
had
unexpectedly
into
action
rostov
without
hearing
boris
the
end
spurred
his
horse
where
are
you
off
asked
boris
with
message
his
majesty

that

with

the
foreboding
evil
that
had

come
over

was
more
and
more
confirmed
the
farther
rode
into
the

behind
the

was

then
the

died
down
rostov
learned
later
that
russian

austrian
soldiers
had
been
firing

what
does
all

and
here
where

neither

were
there
only
disorganized
crowds
troops
various
kinds
urged
his
already
weary
horse
get
quickly
past
these
crowds
but
the
farther
went
the
more
disorganized
they
were
the
highroad
which
had
come
out
was
thronged
with
caleches
carriages
all
sorts
and
russian

austrian
soldiers
all

some
wounded

some
not
this
whole
mass
droned

under
the
dismal
influence
cannon

flying
from

where
the

rostov
kept
asking

from
anyone

seizing

his

forced
him

they
all
bolted
long

said
the
soldier
laughing
for
some
reason
and
shaking
himself
free
having
left
that
soldier
who
was
evidently
drunk
rostov
stopped
the

some

and
began

the

announced
that
the

along

the

now
after
the

saw
him
just
see
you
there
sat
the

pale
anything

anyone
except

rostov
let
the

and
was
about
ride
when
wounded
officer
passing
addressed
him
who
you
want
asked
the
commander
chief
was
killed
cannon
ball
struck
the
breast
before
our
regiment
not
killed
wounded
another
officer
corrected
him
who
kutuzov
asked
rostov
not
kutuzov
but
what
his
name
well
never
mind
there
are
not
many
left
alive
that
way
that
village
all
the
commanders
are
there
said
the
officer
pointing
the
village
hosjeradek
and
walked
rostov
rode
footpace
not
knowing
why
whom
was
now
going
the
emperor
was
wounded
the
battle
lost
was
impossible
doubt
now
rostov
rode
the
direction
pointed
out
him
which
saw
turrets
and
church
what
need
hurry
what
was
now
say
the
tsar
kutuzov
even
they
were
alive
and
unwounded
take
this
road
your
honor
that
way
you
will
killed
once
soldier
shouted
him
they
kill
you
there
what
are
you
talking
about
said
another
where
that
way
nearer
rostov
considered
and
then
went
the
direction
where
they
said
would
killed
all
the
same
now
the
emperor
wounded
try
save
myself
thought
rode
the
region
where
the
greatest
number
men
had
perished
fleeing
from
pratzen
the
french
had
not
yet
occupied
that
region
and
the
russians
the
uninjured
and
slightly
wounded
had
left
long
ago
all
about
the
field
like
heaps
manure
well
kept
plowland
lay
from
ten
fifteen
dead
and
wounded
each
couple
acres
the
wounded
crept
together
twos
and
threes
and
one
could
hear
their
distressing
screams
and
groans
sometimes
feigned
seemed
rostov
put
his
horse
trot
avoid
seeing
all
these
suffering
men
and
felt
afraid
afraid
not
for
his
life
but
for
the
courage
needed
and
which
knew
would
not
stand
the
sight
these
unfortunates
the
french
who
had
ceased
firing
this
field
strewn
with
dead
and
wounded
where
there
was
one
left
fire
seeing
adjutant
riding
over
trained
gun
him
and
fired
several
shots
the
sensation
those
terrible
whistling
sounds
and
the
corpses
around
him
merged
rostov
mind
into
single
feeling
terror
and
pity
for
himself
remembered
his
mother
last
letter
what
would
she
feel
thought
she
saw
here
now
this
field
with
the
cannon
aimed
the
village
hosjeradek
there
were
russian
troops
retiring
from
the
field
battle
who
though
still
some
confusion
were
less
disordered
the
french
cannon
did
not
reach
there
and
the
musketry
fire
sounded
far
away
here
everyone
clearly
saw
and
said
that
the
battle
was
lost
one
whom
rostov
asked
could
tell
him
where
the
emperor
kutuzov
was
some
said
the
report
that
the
emperor
was
wounded
was
correct
others
that
was
not
and
explained
the
false
rumor
that
had
spread
the
fact
that
the
emperor
carriage
had
really
galloped
from
the
field
battle
with
the
pale
and
terrified
ober
hofmarschal
count
tolstoy
who
had
ridden
out
the
battlefield
with
others
the
emperor
suite
one
officer
told
rostov
that
had
seen
someone
from
headquarters
behind
the
village
the
left
and
thither
rostov
rode
not
hoping
find
anyone
but
merely
ease
his
conscience
when
had
ridden
about
two
miles
and
had
passed
the
last
the
russian
troops
saw
near
kitchen
garden
with
ditch
round
two
men
horseback
facing
the
ditch
one
with
white
plume
his
hat
seemed
familiar
rostov
the
other
beautiful
chestnut
horse
which
rostov
fancied
had
seen
before
rode
the
ditch
struck
his
horse
with
his
spurs
and
giving
the
rein
leaped
lightly
over
only
little
earth
crumbled
from
the
bank
under
the
horse
hind
hoofs
turning
the
horse
sharply
again
jumped
the
ditch
and
deferentially
addressed
the
horseman
with
the
white
plumes
evidently
suggesting
that
should
the
same
the
rider
whose
figure
seemed
familiar
rostov
and
involuntarily
riveted
his
attention
made
gesture
refusal
with
his
head
and
hand
and
that
gesture
rostov
instantly
recognized
his
lamented
and
adored
monarch
but
can
alone
the
midst
this
empty
field
thought
rostov
that
moment
alexander
turned
his
head
and
rostov
saw
the
beloved
features
that
were
deeply
engraved
his
memory
the
emperor
was
pale
his
cheeks
sunken
and
his
eyes
hollow
but
the
charm
the
mildness
his
features
was
all
the
greater
rostov
was
happy
the
assurance
that
the
rumors
about
the
emperor
being
wounded
were
false
was
happy
seeing
him
knew
that
might
and
even
ought
straight
him
and
give
the
message
dolgorukov
had
ordered
him
deliver
but
youth
love
trembles
unnerved
and
dares
not
utter
the
thoughts
has
dreamed
for
nights
but
looks
around
for
help
chance
delay
and
flight
when
the
longed
for
moment
comes
and
alone
with
her
rostov
now
that
had
attained
what
had
longed
for
more
than
anything
else
the
world
did
not
know
how
approach
the
emperor
and
thousand
reasons
occurred
him
why
would
inconvenient
unseemly
and
impossible
what
were
glad
chance
take
advantage
his
being
alone
and
despondent
strange
face
may
seem
unpleasant
painful
him
this
moment
sorrow
besides
what
can
say
him
now
when
heart
fails
and
mouth
feels
dry
the
mere
sight
him
not
one
the
innumerable
speeches
addressed
the
emperor
that
had
composed
his
imagination
could
now
recall
those
speeches
were
intended
for
quite
other
conditions
they
were
for
the
most
part
spoken
moment
victory
and
triumph
generally
when
was
dying
wounds
and
the
sovereign
had
thanked
him
for
heroic
deeds
and
while
dying
expressed
the
love
his
actions
had
proved
besides
how
can
ask
the
emperor
for
his
instructions
for
the
right
flank
now
that
nearly
four
clock
and
the
battle
lost
certainly
must
not
approach
him
must
not
intrude
his
reflections
better
die
thousand
times
than
risk
receiving
unkind
look
bad
opinion
from
him
rostov
decided
and
sorrowfully
and
with
heart
full
despair
rode
away
continually
looking
back
the
tsar
who
still
remained
the
same
attitude
indecision
while
rostov
was
thus
arguing
with
himself
and
riding
sadly
away
captain
von
toll
chanced
ride
the
same
spot
and
seeing
the
emperor
once
rode
him
offered
his
services
and
assisted
him
cross
the
ditch
foot
the
emperor
wishing
rest
and
feeling
unwell
sat
down
under
apple
tree
and
von
toll
remained
beside
him
rostov
from
distance
saw
with
envy
and
remorse
how
von
toll
spoke
long
and
warmly
the
emperor
and
how
the
emperor
evidently
weeping
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
pressed
von
toll
hand
and
might
have
been
his
place
thought
rostov
and
hardly
restraining
his
tears
pity
for
the
emperor
rode
utter
despair
not
knowing
where
why
was
now
riding
his
despair
was
all
the
greater
from
feeling
that
his
own
weakness
was
the
cause
his
grief
might
not
only
might
but
should
have
gone
the
sovereign
was
unique
chance
show
his
devotion
the
emperor
and
had
not
made
use
what
have
done
thought
and
turned
round
and
galloped
back
the
place
where
had
seen
the
emperor
but
there
was
one
beyond
the
ditch
now
only
some
carts
and
carriages
were
passing
from
one
the
drivers
learned
that
kutuzov
staff
were
not
far
off
the
village
the
vehicles
were
going

followed
them

was

and
heard
the
sound
approaching
horses
and
voices
speaking
french
opened
his
eyes
above
him
again
was
the
same
lofty
sky
with
clouds
that
had
risen
and
were
floating
still
higher
and
between
them
gleamed
blue
infinity
did
not
turn
his
head
and
did
not
see
those
who
judging
the
sound
hoofs
and
voices
had
ridden
and
stopped
near
him
was
napoleon
accompanied
two
aides
camp
bonaparte
riding
over
the
battlefield
had
given
final
orders
strengthen
the
batteries
firing
the
augesd
dam
and
was
looking
the
killed
and
wounded
left
the
field
fine
men
remarked
napoleon
looking
dead
russian
grenadier
who
with
his
face
buried
the
ground
and
blackened
nape
lay
his
stomach
with
already
stiffened
arm
flung
wide
the
ammunition
for
the

position
exhausted
your
majesty
said
adjutant
who
had
come
from
the
batteries
that
were
firing
augesd
have
some
brought
from
the
reserve
said
napoleon
and
having
gone
few
steps
stopped
before
prince
andrew
who
lay
his
back
with
the
flagstaff
that
had
been
dropped
beside
him
the
flag
had
already
been
taken
the
french
trophy
that
fine
death
said
napoleon
gazed
bolkonski
prince
andrew
understood
that
this
was
said
him
and
that
was
napoleon
who
said
heard
the
speaker
addressed
sire
but
heard
the
words
might
have
heard
the
buzzing
fly
not
only
did
they
not
interest
him
but
took
notice
them
and
once
forgot
them
his
head
was
burning
felt
himself
bleeding
death
and
saw
above
him
the
remote
lofty
and
everlasting
sky
knew
was
napoleon
his
hero
but
that
moment
napoleon
seemed
him
such
small
insignificant
creature
compared
with
what
was
passing
now
between
himself
and
that
lofty
infinite
sky
with
the
clouds
flying
over
that
moment
meant
nothing
him
who
might
standing
over
him
what
was
said
him
was
only
glad
that
people
were
standing
near
him
and
only
wished
that
they
would
help
him
and
bring
him
back
life
which
seemed
him
beautiful
now
that
had
today
learned
understand
differently
collected
all
his
strength
stir
and
utter
sound
feebly
moved
his
leg
and
uttered
weak
sickly
groan
which
aroused
his
own
pity
alive
said
napoleon
lift
this
young
man
and
carry
him
the
dressing
station
having
said
this
napoleon
rode
meet
marshal
lannes
who
hat
hand
rode
smiling
the
emperor
congratulate
him
the
victory
prince
andrew
remembered
nothing
more
lost
consciousness
from
the
terrible
pain
being
lifted
onto
the
stretcher
the
jolting
while
being
moved
and
the
probing
his
wound
the
dressing
station
did
not
regain
consciousness
till
late
the
day
when
with
other
wounded
and
captured
russian
officers
was
carried
the
hospital
during
this
transfer
felt
little
stronger
and
was
able
look
about
him
and
even
speak
the
first
words
heard
coming
his
senses
were
those
french
convoy
officer
who
said
rapidly
must
halt
here
the
emperor
will
pass
here
immediately
will
please
him
see
these
gentlemen
prisoners
there
are
many
prisoners
today
nearly
the
whole
russian
army
that
probably
tired
them
said
another
officer
all
the
same
they
say
this
one
the
commander
all
the
emperor
alexander

said
the
first
one
indicating

bonaparte
having
come

stopped

the

asked

said
napoleon
and
who
that
young
man
beside
you

named

sukhtelen
after
looking
him
napoleon
smiled
very
young
come
meddle
with

muttered
sukhtelen
failing
voice
splendid
reply
said
napoleon
young
man
you
will
far
prince
andrew
who
had
also
been
brought
forward
before
the
emperor
eyes
complete
the
show
prisoners
could
not
fail
attract
his
attention
napoleon
apparently
remembered
seeing
him
the
battlefield
and
addressing
him
again
used
the
epithet
young
man
that
was
connected
his
memory
with
prince
andrew
well
and
you
young
man
said
how
you
feel
mon
brave
though
five
minutes
before
prince
andrew
had
been
able
say
few
words
the
soldiers
who
were
carrying
him
now
with
his
eyes
fixed
straight
napoleon
was
silent
insignificant
that
moment
seemed
him
all
the
interests
that
engrossed
napoleon
mean
did
his
hero
himself
with
his
paltry
vanity
and
joy
victory
appear
compared
the
lofty
equitable
and
kindly
sky
which
had
seen
and
understood
that
could
not
answer
him
everything
seemed
futile
and
insignificant
comparison
with
the
stern
and
solemn
train
thought
that
weakness
from
loss
blood
suffering
and
the
nearness
death
aroused
him
looking
into
napoleon
eyes
prince
andrew
thought
the
insignificance
greatness
the
unimportance
life
which
one
could
understand
and
the
still
greater
unimportance
death
the
meaning
which
one
alive
could
understand
explain
the
emperor
without
waiting
for
answer
turned
away
and
said
one
the
officers
went
have
these
gentlemen
attended
and
taken
bivouac
let
doctor
larrey
examine
their
wounds
revoir
prince
repnin
and
spurred
his
horse
and
galloped
away
his
face
shone
with
self
satisfaction
and
pleasure
the
soldiers
who
had
carried
prince
andrew
had
noticed
and
taken
the
little
gold
icon
princess
mary
had
hung
round
her
brother
neck
but
seeing
the
favor
the
emperor
showed
the
prisoners
they
now
hastened
return
the
holy
image
prince
andrew
did
not
see
how
and
whom
was
replaced
but
the
little
icon
with
its
thin
gold
chain
suddenly
appeared
upon
his
chest
outside
his
uniform
would
good
thought
prince
andrew
glancing
the
icon
his
sister
had
hung
round
his
neck
with
such
emotion
and
reverence
would
good
everything
were
clear
and
simple
seems
mary
how
good
would
know
where
seek
for
help
this
life
and
what
expect
after
beyond
the
grave
how
happy
and
calm
should
could
now
say
lord
have
mercy
but
whom
should
say
that
either
power
indefinable
incomprehensible
which
not
only
cannot
address
but
which
cannot
even
express
words
the
great
all
nothing
said
himself
that
god
who
has
been
sewn
into
this
amulet
mary
there
nothing
certain
nothing
all
except
the
unimportance
everything
understand
and
the
greatness
something
incomprehensible
but
all
important
the
stretchers
moved
every
jolt
again
felt
unendurable
pain
his
feverishness
increased
and
grew
delirious
visions
his
father
wife
sister
and
future
son
and
the
tenderness
had
felt
the
night
before
the
battle
the
figure
the
insignificant
little
napoleon
and
above
all
this
the
lofty
sky
formed
the
chief
subjects
his
delirious
fancies
the
quiet
home
life
and
peaceful
happiness
bald
hills
presented
itself
him
was
already
enjoying
that
happiness
when
that
little
napoleon
had
suddenly
appeared
with
his
unsympathizing
look
shortsighted
delight
the
misery
others
and
doubts
and
torments
had
followed
and
only
the
heavens
promised
peace
toward
morning
all
these
dreams
melted
and
merged
into
the
chaos
and
darkness
unconciousness
and
oblivion
which
the
opinion
napoleon
doctor
larrey
was
much
more
likely
end
death
than
convalescence
nervous
bilious

said
larrey

not
recover

across
the
snow
covered
road
did
not

wake
the
way
moscow
but
lay
the
bottom
the
sleigh
beside
rostov
who
grew
more
and
more
impatient
the
nearer

where
the

there
zakhar

the

and
rostov
saw
overhead
the
old
familiar

broken
off

and
the
post
the
side
the
pavement
sprang
out
before
the
sleigh
stopped
and
ran
into
the
hall
the

cold
and
silent
quite
regardless

stopping
for
moment
with

immediately
starting

and
the
warped
steps
the
familiar
staircase
the
well
known
old

which
always
angered
the

rostov
who
had
completely
forgotten
denisov
not
wishing
anyone
forestall
him
threw
off
his
fur
coat
and
ran
tiptoe
through
the
large
dark
ballroom
all
was
the
same
there
were
the
same
old
card
tables
and
the
same
chandelier
with
cover
over
but
someone
had
already
seen
the
young
master
and
before
had
reached
the
drawing
room
something
flew
out
from
side
door
like
tornado
and
began
hugging
and
kissing
him
another
and
yet
another
creature
the
same
kind
sprang
from
second
door
and
third
more
hugging
more
kissing
more
outcries
and
tears
joy
could
not
distinguish
which
was
papa
which
natasha
and
which
petya

and
kissed

flocked
into
the
room
exclaiming
and
ing
and
ing
petya
clinging
his
legs
kept
shouting
and

natasha
after
she
had
pulled
him
down
toward
her
and
covered
his
face
with
kisses
holding
him
tight
the
skirt
his
coat
sprang
away
and
pranced
and
down
one
place
like
goat
and
shrieked
piercingly
all
around
were
loving
eyes
glistening
with
tears
joy
and
all
around
were
lips
seeking
kiss
sonya
too
all
rosy
red
clung
his
arm
and
radiant
with
bliss
looked
eagerly
toward
his
eyes
waiting
for
the
look
for
which
she
longed
sonya
now
was
sixteen
and
she
was
very
pretty
especially
this
moment
happy
rapturous
excitement
she
gazed
him
not
taking
her
eyes
off
him
and
smiling
and
holding
her
breath
gave
her
grateful
look
but
was
still
expectant
and
looking
for
someone
the
old
countess
had
not
yet
come
but
now
steps
were
heard
the
door
steps
rapid
that
they
could
hardly
his
mother
yet
was
she
dressed
new
gown
which
did
not
know
made
since
had
left
all
the
others
let
him
and
ran
her
when
they
met
she
fell
his
breast
sobbing
she
could
not
lift
her
face
but
only
pressed
the
cold
braiding
his
hussar
jacket
denisov
who
had
come
into
the
room
unnoticed
anyone
stood
there
and
wiped
his
eyes

natasha
beside
herself
with
rapture
springing
him
putting
her
arms
round
him
and
kissing
him
this
escapade
made
everybody
feel
confused
denisov
blushed
too
but
smiled
and
taking
natasha
hand
kissed
denisov
was
shown
the
room
prepared
for
him
and
the
rostovs
all
gathered
round
nicholas
the
sitting
room
the
old
countess
not
letting
his
hand
and
kissing
every
moment
sat
beside
him
the

crowding
round
him

never
taking
their
blissfully
adoring
eyes
off
him

for
the
places
nearest
him
and
disputed
with
one
another
who
should
bring
him
his
tea
handkerchief
and
pipe
rostov
was
very
happy
the
love
they
showed
him
but
the
first
moment
meeting
had
been
beatific
that
his
present
joy
seemed
insufficient
and
kept
expecting
something
more

and
yet
more

said
that
she
said
herself
not
because
what
they
were
saying
was
amusing
but
because
she
felt
happy
and
was
unable
control
her
joy
which
expressed
itself
laughter
how
nice
how
splendid
she
said
everything
rostov
felt
that
under
the
influence
the
warm
rays
love
that
childlike
smile
which
had
not
once
appeared
his
face
since
left

for

she
pulled
her
muslin
sleeve
and
showed
him
red
scar
her
long
slender
delicate
arm
high
above
the
elbow
that
part
that
covered
even
ball
dress
burned
this
prove
love
for
her
just
heated
ruler
the
fire
and
pressed
there
sitting
the
sofa
with
the
little
cushions
its
arms
what
used
his
old
schoolroom
and
looking
into
natasha
wildly
bright
eyes
rostov
entered
that
world
home
and
childhood
which
had
meaning
for
anyone
else
but
gave
him
some
the
best
joys
his
life
and
the
burning
arm
with
ruler
proof
love
did
not
seem
him
senseless
understood
and
was
not
surprised
well
and
that
all
asked
are
such
friends
such
friends
all
that
ruler
business
was
just
nonsense
but
are
friends
forever

she
loves
anyone

but
don

that

quickly
well
what

suddenly
flushed
why

says

that
lovely
and
noble
yes

asked
natasha
seriously
and
excitedly
that
was
evident
that
what
she
was
now
saying
she
had
talked
before
with
tears
rostov
became
thoughtful
never
back
word
said
besides
sonya
charming
that
only
fool
would
renounce
such
happiness
cried
natasha
she
and
have
already
talked
over
knew
you
say
but
won
because
you
see
you
say
that
you
consider
yourself
bound
your
promise
will
seem
she
had
not
meant
seriously
makes
you
were
marrying

because
you
must
and
that
wouldn
all
rostov
saw
that
had
been
well
considered
them
sonya
had
already
struck
him
her
beauty
the
preceding
day
today
when
had
caught
glimpse
her
she
seemed
still
more
lovely
she
was
charming
girl
sixteen
evidently
passionately
love
with
him
did
not
doubt
that
for
instant
why
should
not
love
her
now
and
even
marry
her
rostov
thought
but
just
now
there
were
many
other
pleasures
and
interests
before
him
yes
they
have
taken
wise
decision
thought
must
remain
free
well
then
that
excellent
said
talk
over
later
how
glad
have
you
well
and
are
you
still
true
boris
continued
what
nonsense
cried
natasha
laughing
don
think
about
him
anyone
else
and
don
want
anything
the
kind
dear
then

repeated
natasha
and
happy
smile
lit
her
face
have
you
seen
duport
not
seen
duport
the
famous
dancer
well
then
you
won
understand
that
what
curving
her
arms
natasha
held
out
her
skirts
dancers
ran
back
few
steps
turned
cut
caper
brought
her
little
feet
sharply
together
and
made
some
steps
the
very
tips
her
toes
see
standing
see
she
said
but
could
not
maintain
herself
her
toes
any
longer
that
what
never
marry
anyone
but
will
dancer
only
don
tell
anyone
rostov
laughed
loud
and
merrily
that
denisov
his
bedroom
felt
envious
and
natasha
could
not
help
joining
but
don
you
think
nice
she
kept
repeating
nice
and
you
longer
wish
marry
boris
natasha
flared
don
want
marry
anyone
and
tell
him
when
see
him
dear
said
rostov
but
that
all
rubbish
natasha
chattered
and
denisov
nice
she
asked
yes
indeed
well
then
good
and
dress
very
terrible
denisov
why
terrible
asked
nicholas
vaska
splendid
fellow
you
call
him
vaska
that
funny
and
very
nice
very
well
then
quick
all
have
breakfast
together
and
natasha
rose
and
went
out
the
room
tiptoe
like
ballet
dancer
but
smiling
only
happy
girls
fifteen
can
smile
when
rostov
met
sonya
the
drawing
room
reddened
did
not
know
how
behave
with
her
the
evening
before
the
first
happy
moment
meeting
they
had
kissed
each
other
but
today
they
felt
could
not
done
felt
that
everybody
including
his
mother
and
sisters
was
looking
inquiringly
him
and
watching
see
how
would
behave
with
her
kissed
her
hand
and
addressed
her
not
thou
but
you
sonya
but
their
eyes
met
and
said
thou
and
exchanged
tender
kisses
her
looks
asked
him
forgive
her
for
having
dared
natasha
intermediacy
remind
him
his
promise
and
then
thanked
him
for
his
love
his
looks
thanked
her
for
offering
him
his
freedom
and
told
her
that
one
way
another
would
never
cease
love
her
for
that
would
impossible
how
strange
said
vera
selecting
moment
when
all
were
silent
that
sonya
and
nicholas
now
say
you
one
another
and
meet
like
strangers
vera
remark
was
correct
her
remarks
always
were
but
like
most
her
observations
made
everyone
feel
uncomfortable
not
only
sonya
nicholas
and
natasha
but
even
the
old
countess
who
dreading
this
love
affair
which
might
hinder
nicholas
from
making
brilliant
match
blushed
like
girl
denisov
rostov
surprise
appeared
the
drawing
room
with
pomaded
hair
perfumed
and
new
uniform
looking
just
smart
made
himself
when
going
into
battle
and
was
more
amiable
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
than
rostov
had
ever
expected
see
him
chapter
his
return
moscow
from
the
army
nicholas
rostov
was
welcomed
his
home
circle
the
best
sons
hero
and
their
darling
nikolenka
his
relations
charming
attractive
and
polite
young
man
his
acquaintances
handsome
lieutenant
hussars
good
dancer
and
one
the
best
matches
the
city
the
rostovs
knew
everybody
moscow
the
old
count
had
money
enough
that
year
all
his
estates
had
been
remortgaged
and
nicholas
acquiring
trotter
his
own
very
stylish
riding
breeches
the
latest
cut
such
one
else
yet
had
moscow
and
boots
the
latest
fashion
with
extremely
pointed
toes
and
small
silver
spurs
passed
his
time
very
gaily
after
short
period
adapting
himself
the
old
conditions
life
nicholas
found
very
pleasant
home
again
felt
that
had
grown
and
matured
very
much
his
despair
failing
scripture
examination
his
borrowing
money
from
gavril
pay
sleigh
driver
his
kissing
sonya
the
sly
now
recalled
all
this
childishness
had
left
immeasurably
behind
now
was
lieutenant
hussars
jacket
laced
with
silver
and
wearing
the
cross
george
awarded
soldiers
for
bravery
action
and
the
company
well
known
elderly
and
respected
racing
men
was
training
trotter
his
own
for
race
knew
lady
one
the
boulevards
whom
visited
evening
led
the
mazurka
the
arkharovs
ball
talked
about
the
war
with
field
marshal
kamenski
visited
the
english
club
and
was
intimate
terms
with
colonel
forty
whom
denisov
had
introduced
him
his
passion
for
the
emperor
had
cooled
somewhat
moscow
but
still
did
not
see
him
and
had
opportunity
seeing
him
often
spoke
about
him
and
about
his
love
for
him
letting
understood
that
had
not
told
all
and
that
there
was
something
his
feelings
for
the
emperor
not
everyone
could
understand
and
with
his
whole
soul
shared
the
adoration
then
common
moscow
for
the
emperor
who
was
spoken
the
angel
incarnate
during
rostov
short
stay
moscow
before
rejoining
the
army
did
not
draw
closer
sonya
but
rather
drifted
away
from
her
she
was
very
pretty
and
sweet
and
evidently
deeply
love
with
him
but
was
the
period
youth
when
there
seems
much
that
there
time
for
that
sort
thing
and
young
man
fears
bind
himself
and
prizes
his
freedom
which
needs
for
many
other
things
when
thought
sonya
during
this
stay
moscow
said
himself
there
will
and
there
are
many
more
such
girls
somewhere
whom
not
yet
know
there
will
time
enough
think
about
love
when
want
but
now
have
time
besides
seemed
him
that
the
society
women
was
rather
derogatory
his
manhood
went
balls
and
into
ladies
society
with
affectation
doing
against
his
will
the
races
the
english
club
sprees
with
denisov
and
visits
certain
house
that
was
another
matter
and
quite
the
thing
for
dashing
young
hussar
the

for
the
success
the
fete
the
club
cook
and
the
steward
listened
the

pleased

his

the
old
count
pretended
angry
yes

yourself
and
the
count
turned
the
cook

with
shrewd
and
respectful
expression
looked

sympathetically
the

that
moment
with
noiseless
footsteps
and
with
the
businesslike
preoccupied
yet
meekly
christian
look
which
never
left
her
face
anna
mikhaylovna
entered
the
hall
though
she
came
upon
the
count

dressing
gown
every
day
invariably
became
confused
and
begged

next

the
third

soon
after
one
clock
two
hundred
and
fifty
members
the
english
club
and
fifty
guests
were
awaiting
the
guest
honor
and
hero
the
austrian
campaign
prince
bagration
dinner
the
first
arrival
the
news
the
battle
austerlitz
moscow
had
been
bewildered
that
time
the
russians
were
used
victories
that
receiving
news
the
defeat
some
would
simply
not
believe
while
others
sought
some
extraordinary
explanation
strange
event
the
english
club
where
all
who
were
distinguished
important
and
well
informed
foregathered
when
the
news
began
arrive
december
nothing
was
said
about
the
war
and
the
last
battle
though
all
were
conspiracy
silence
the
men
who
set
the
tone
conversation
count
rostopchin
prince
yuri
dolgorukov
valuev
count
markov
and
prince
vyazemski
did
not
show
themselves
the
club
but
met
private
houses
intimate
circles
and
the
moscovites
who
took
their
opinions
from
others
ilya
rostov
among
them
remained
for
while
without
any
definite
opinion
the
subject
the
war
and
without
leaders
the
moscovites
felt
that
something
was
wrong
and
that
discuss
the
bad
news
was
difficult
and
was
best
silent
but
after
while
just
jury
comes
out
its
room
the
bigwigs
who
guided
the
club
opinion
reappeared
and
everybody
began
speaking
clearly
and
definitely
reasons
were
found
for
the
incredible
unheard
and
impossible
event
russian
defeat
everything
became
clear
and
all
corners
moscow
the
same
things
began
said
these
reasons
were
the
treachery
the
austrians
defective
commissariat
the
treachery
the
pole
przebyszewski
and
the
frenchman
langeron
kutuzov
incapacity
and
was
whispered
the
youth
and
inexperience
the
sovereign
who
had
trusted
worthless
and
insignificant
people
but
the
army
the
russian
army
everyone
declared
was
extraordinary
and
had
achieved
miracles
valor
the
soldiers
officers
and
generals
were
heroes
but
the
hero
heroes
was
prince
bagration
distinguished
his
schon
grabern
affair
and
the
retreat
from
austerlitz
where
alone
had
withdrawn
his
column
unbroken
and
had
all
day
beaten
back
enemy
force
twice
numerous
his
own
what
also
conduced
bagration
being
selected
moscow
hero
was
the
fact
that
had
connections
the
city
and
was
stranger
there
his
person
honor
was
shown
simple
fighting
russian
soldier
without
connections
and
intrigues
and
one
who
was
associated
memories
the
italian
campaign
with
the
name
suvorov
moreover
paying
such
honor
bagration
was
the
best
way
expressing
disapproval
and
dislike
kutuzov
had
there
been
bagration
would
have
been
necessary
invent
him
said
the
wit
shinshin
parodying
the
words
voltaire
kutuzov
one
spoke
except
some
who
abused
him
whispers
calling
him
court
weathercock
and
old
satyr
all
moscow
repeated
prince
dolgorukov
saying
you
modeling
and
modeling
you
must
get
smeared
with
clay
suggesting
consolation
for

reproachfully

and
fixing
his
weary

the

and

that

recognized
him
and
said
few
words

disjointed
and
awkward
were
all
the
words

that
day
and

looked
joyfully
and
proudly
around
while

spoke

and
his

not
been

not
feel
quite

till
the

winked
the

whispered
directions
the
footmen
and
awaited
each
expected
dish
with
some
anxiety
everything
was
excellent
with
the
second
course
gigantic
sterlet
sight
which
ilya
rostov
blushed
with
self
conscious
pleasure
the
footmen
began
popping
corks
and
filling
the
champagne
glasses
after
the
fish
which
made
certain

exchanged
glances
with
the
other

there
will
many

begin
whispered
and
taking
his
glass
rose
all
were
silent
waiting
for
what
would
say

cried
and
the

and
enthusiasm
the

immediately
struck

ecstatic
voice
could
heard
above
the
three
hundred
others
nearly
wept
the
health
our
sovereign
the
emperor
roared
hurrah
and
emptying
his
glass
one
gulp
dashed
the
floor
many
followed
his
example
and
the
loud
shouting
continued
for
long
time
when
the
voices
subsided
the
footmen
cleared
away
the
broken
glass
and
everybody
sat
down
again
smiling
the
noise
they
had
made
and
exchanging
remarks
the
old
count
rose
once
more
glanced
note
lying
beside
his
plate
and
proposed
toast
the
health
the
hero
our
last
campaign
prince
peter
ivanovich
bagration
and
again
his
blue
eyes
grew
moist
hurrah
cried
the
three
hundred
voices
again
but
instead
the

began
singing

soon
the
singing
was
over
another
and
another
toast
was
proposed
and
count
ilya
rostov
became
more
and
more
moved
more
glass
was
smashed
and
the
shouting
grew
louder
they
drank
bekleshev

dolgorukov
apraksin
valuev
the

all
the

members
and
all
the
club
guests
and
finally
count
ilya
rostov
separately
the
organizer
the
banquet
that
toast
the
count
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
covering
his
face
wept
outright
chapter
pierre
sat
opposite
dolokhov
and
nicholas
rostov
usual
ate
and
drank
much
and
eagerly
but
those
who
knew
him
intimately
noticed
that
some
great
change
had
come
over
him
that
day
was
silent
all
through
dinner
and
looked
about
blinking
and
scowling
with
fixed
eyes
and
look
complete
absent
mindedness
kept
rubbing
the
bridge
his
nose
his
face
was
depressed
and
gloomy
seemed
see
and
hear
nothing
what
was
going
around
him
and
absorbed
some
depressing
and
unsolved
problem
the
unsolved
problem
that
tormented
him
was
caused
hints
given
the
princess
his
cousin
moscow
concerning
dolokhov
intimacy
with
his
wife
and
anonymous
letter
had
received
that
morning
which
the
mean
jocular
way
common
anonymous
letters
said
that
saw
badly
through
his
spectacles
but
that
his
wife
connection
with
dolokhov
was
secret
one
but
himself
pierre
absolutely
disbelieved
both
the
princess
hints
and
the
letter
but
feared
now
look
dolokhov
who
was
sitting
opposite
him
every
time
chanced
meet
dolokhov
handsome
insolent
eyes
pierre
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
rising
his
soul
and
turned
quickly
away
involuntarily
recalling
his
wife
past
and
her
relations
with
dolokhov
pierre
saw
clearly
that
what
was
said
the
letter
might
true
might
least
seem
true
had
not
referred
his
wife
involuntarily
remembered
how
dolokhov
who
had
fully
recovered
his
former
position
after
the
campaign
had
returned
petersburg
and
come
him
availing
himself
his
friendly
relations
with
pierre
boon
companion
dolokhov
had
come
straight
his
house
and
pierre
had
put
him
and
lent
him
money
pierre
recalled
how
helene
had
smilingly
expressed
disapproval
dolokhov
living
their
house
and
how
cynically
dolokhov
had
praised
his
wife
beauty
him
and
from
that
time
till
they
came
moscow
had
not
left
them
for
day
yes
very
handsome
thought
pierre
and
know
him
would
particularly
pleasant
him
dishonor
name
and
ridicule
just
because
have
exerted
myself
his
behalf
befriended
him
and
helped
him
know
and
understand
what
spice
that
would
add
the
pleasure
deceiving
really
were
true
yes
were
true
but
not
believe
have
right
and
can
believe
remembered
the
expression
dolokhov
face
assumed
his
moments
cruelty
when
tying
the
policeman
the
bear
and
dropping
them
into
the
water
when
challenged
man
duel
without
any
reason
shot
post
boy
horse
with
pistol
that
expression
was
often
dolokhov
face
when
looking
him
yes
bully
thought
pierre
kill
man
means
nothing
him
must
seem
him
that
everyone
afraid
him
and
that
must
please
him
must
think
that
too
afraid
him
and
fact
afraid
him
thought
and
again
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
rising
his
soul
dolokhov
denisov
and
rostov
were
now
sitting
opposite
pierre
and
seemed
very
gay
rostov
was
talking
merrily
his
two
friends
one
whom
was
dashing
hussar
and
the
other
notorious
duelist
and
rake
and
every
now
and
then
glanced
ironically
pierre
whose
preoccupied
absent
minded
and
massive
figure
was
very
noticeable
one
the
dinner
rostov
looked
inimically
pierre
first
because
pierre
appeared
his
hussar
eyes
rich
civilian
the
husband
beauty
and
word
old
woman
and
secondly
because
pierre
his
preoccupation
and
absent
mindedness
had
not
recognized
rostov
and
had
not
responded
his
greeting
when
the
emperor
health
was
drunk
pierre
lost
thought
did
not
rise
lift
his
glass
what
are
you
about
shouted
rostov
looking
him
ecstasy
exasperation
don
you
hear
his
majesty
the
emperor
health
pierre
sighed
rose
submissively
emptied
his
glass
and
waiting
till
all
were
seated
again
turned
with
his
kindly
smile
rostov
why
didn
recognize
you
said
but
rostov
was
otherwise
engaged
was
shouting
hurrah
why
don
you
renew
the
acquaintance
said
dolokhov
rostov
confound
him
fool
said
rostov
one
should
make
the
husbands
pretty
women
said
denisov
pierre
did
not
catch
what
they
were
saying
but
knew
they
were
talking
about
him
reddened
and
turned
away
well
now
the
health
handsome
women
said
dolokhov
and
with
serious
expression
but
with
smile
lurking
the
corners
his
mouth
turned
with
his
glass
pierre
here
the
health
lovely
women
peterkin
and
their
lovers
added
pierre
with
downcast
eyes
drank
out
his
glass
without
looking
dolokhov
answering
him
the
footman
who
was
distributing
leaflets
with
kutuzov
cantata
laid
one
before
pierre
one
the
principal
guests
was
just
going
take
when
dolokhov
leaning
across
snatched
from
his
hand
and
began
reading
pierre
looked
dolokhov
and
his
eyes
dropped
the
something
terrible
and
monstrous
that
had
tormented
him
all
dinnertime
rose
and
took
possession
him
leaned
his
whole
massive
body
across
the
table
how
dare
you
take
shouted
hearing
that
cry
and
seeing
whom
was
addressed
nesvitski
and
the
neighbor
his
right
quickly
turned
alarm
bezukhov
don
don
what
are
you
about
whispered
their
frightened
voices
dolokhov
looked
pierre
with
clear
mirthful
cruel
eyes
and
that
smile
his
which
seemed
say
this
what
like
you
shan
have
said
distinctly
pale
with
quivering
lips
pierre
snatched
the
copy
you
you
scoundrel
challenge
you
ejaculated
and
pushing
back
his
chair
rose
from
the
table
the
very
instant
did
this
and
uttered
those
words
pierre
felt
that
the
question
his
wife
guilt
which
had
been
tormenting
him
the
whole
day
was
finally
and
indubitably
answered
the
affirmative
hated
her
and
was
forever
sundered
from
her
despite
denisov
request
that
would
take
part
the
matter
rostov
agreed
dolokhov
second
and
after
dinner
discussed
the
arrangements
for
the
duel
with
nesvitski
bezukhov
second
pierre
went
home
but
rostov
with
dolokhov
and
denisov
stayed
the
club
till
late
listening
the
gypsies
and
other
singers
well
then
till
tomorrow
sokolniki
said
dolokhov
took
leave
rostov
the
club
porch
and
you
feel
quite
calm
rostov
asked
dolokhov
paused
well
you

our

and
that
how
with

till
tomorrow
dear
fellow
next
day
eight
the
morning
pierre
and
nesvitski
drove
the
sokolniki
forest
and
found
dolokhov
denisov
and
rostov
already
there
pierre
had
the
air
man
preoccupied
with
considerations
which
had
connection
with
the
matter
hand
his
haggard
face
was
yellow
had
evidently
not
slept
that
night
looked
about
distractedly
and
screwed
his
eyes
dazzled
the
sun
was
entirely
absorbed
two
considerations
his
wife
guilt
which
after
his
sleepless
night
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
and
the
guiltlessness
dolokhov
who
had
reason
preserve
the
honor
man
who
was
nothing
him
should
perhaps
have
done
the
same
thing
his
place
thought
pierre
even
certain
that
should
have
done
the
same
then
why
this
duel
this
murder
either
shall
kill
him
will
hit
the
head
elbow
knee
can
away
from
here
run
away
bury
myself
somewhere
passed
through
his
mind
but
just
moments
when
such
thoughts
occurred
him
would
ask
particularly
calm
and
absent
minded
way
which
inspired
the
respect
the
onlookers
will
long
are
things
ready
when
all
was
ready
the
sabers
stuck
the
snow
mark
the
barriers
and
the
pistols
loaded
nesvitski
went
pierre
should
not
doing
duty
count
said
timid
tones
and
should
not
justify
your
confidence
and
the
honor
you
have
done
choosing
for
your
second
this
grave
this
very
grave
moment
did
not
tell
you
the
whole
truth
think
there
sufficient
ground
for
this
affair
for
blood
shed
over
you
were
not
right
not
quite
the
right
you
were
impetuous
yes
horribly
stupid
said
pierre
then
allow
express
your
regrets
and
sure
your
opponent
will
accept
them
said
nesvitski
who
like
the
others
concerned
the
affair
and
like
everyone
similar
cases
did
not
yet
believe
that
the
affair
had
come
actual
duel
you
know
count
much
more
honorable
admit
one
mistake
than
let
matters
become
irreparable
there
was
insult
either
side
allow
convey
what
there
talk
about
said
pierre
all
the
same
everything
ready
added
only
tell
where
and
where
shoot
said
with
unnaturally
gentle
smile
took
the
pistol
his
hand
and
began
asking
about
the
working
the
trigger
had
not
before
held
pistol
his
hand
fact
that
did
not
wish
confess
yes
like
that
know
only
forgot
said
apologies
none
whatever
said
dolokhov
denisov
who
his
side
had
been
attempting
reconciliation
and
also
went
the
appointed
place
the
spot
chosen
for
the
duel
was
some
eighty
paces
from
the
road
where
the
sleighs
had
been
left
small
clearing
the
pine
forest
covered
with
melting
snow
the
frost
having
begun
break
during
the
last
few
days
the
antagonists
stood
forty
paces
apart
the
farther
edge
the
clearing
the
seconds
measuring
the
paces
left
tracks
the
deep
wet
snow
between
the
place
where
they
had
been
standing
and
nesvitski
and
dolokhov
sabers
which
were
stuck
into
the
ground
ten
paces
apart
mark
the
barrier
was
thawing
and
misty
forty
paces
distance
nothing
could
seen
for
three
minutes
all
had
been
ready
but
they
still
delayed
and
all
were
silent
chapter
well
begin
said
dolokhov
all
right
said
pierre
still
smiling
the
same
way
feeling
dread
was
the
air
was
evident
that
the
affair
lightly
begun
could
longer
averted
but
was
taking
its
course
independently
men
will
denisov
first
went
the
barrier
and
announced
the
adve
sawies
have
wefused
weconciliation
please
pwoceed
take
your
pistols
and
the
word
thwee
begin
advance
thwee
shouted
angrily
and
stepped
aside
the
combatants
advanced
along
the
trodden
tracks
nearer
and
nearer
one
another
beginning
see
one
another
through
the
mist
they
had
the
right
fire
when
they
liked
they
approached
the
barrier
dolokhov
walked
slowly
without
raising
his
pistol
looking
intently
with
his
bright
sparkling
blue
eyes
into
his
antagonist
face
his
mouth
wore
its
usual
semblance
smile
can
fire
when
like
said
pierre
and
the
word
three
went
quickly
forward
missing
the
trodden
path
and
stepping
into
the
deep
snow
held
the
pistol
his
right
hand
arm
length
apparently
afraid
shooting
himself
with
his
left
hand
held
carefully
back
because
wished
support
his
right
hand
with
and
knew
must
not
having
advanced
six
paces
and
strayed
off
the
track
into
the
snow
pierre
looked
down
his
feet
then
quickly
glanced
dolokhov
and
bending
his
finger
had
been
shown
fired
not
all
expecting
loud
report
pierre
shuddered
the
sound
and
then
smiling
his
own
sensations
stood
still
the
smoke
rendered
denser
the
mist
prevented
him
from
seeing
anything
for
instant
but
there
was
second
report
had
expected
only
heard
dolokhov
hurried
steps
and
his
figure
came
view
through
the
smoke
was
pressing
one
hand
his
left
side
while
the
other
clutched
his
drooping
pistol
his
face
was
pale
rostov
ran
toward
him
and
said
something
muttered
dolokhov
through
his
teeth
not
over
and
after
stumbling
few
staggering
steps
right
the
saber
sank
the
snow
beside
his
left
hand
was
bloody
wiped
his
coat
and
supported
himself
with
his
frowning
face
was
pallid
and
quivered
plea
began
dolokhov
but
could
not
first
pronounce
the
word
please
uttered
with
effort
pierre
hardly
restraining
his
sobs
began
running
toward
dolokhov
and
was
about
cross
the
space
between
the
barriers
when
dolokhov
cried
your
barrier
and
pierre
grasping
what
was
meant
stopped
his
saber
only
ten
paces
divided
them
dolokhov
lowered
his
head
the
snow
greedily
bit
again
raised
his
head
adjusted
himself
drew
his
legs
and
sat
seeking
firm
center
gravity
sucked
and
swallowed
the
cold
snow
his
lips
quivered
but
his
eyes
still
smiling
glittered
with
effort
and
exasperation
mustered
his
remaining
strength
raised
his
pistol
and
aimed
sideways
cover
yourself
with
your
pistol
ejaculated
nesvitski
cover
yourself
even
denisov
cried
his
adversary
pierre
with
gentle
smile
pity
and
remorse
his
arms
and
legs
helplessly
spread
out
stood
with
his
broad
chest
directly
facing
dolokhov
looked
sorrowfully
him
denisov
rostov
and
nesvitski
closed
their
eyes
the
same
instant
they
heard
report
and
dolokhov
angry
cry
missed
shouted
dolokhov
and
lay
helplessly
face
downwards
the
snow
pierre
clutched
his
temples
and
turning
round
went
into
the
forest
trampling
through
the
deep
snow
and
muttering
incoherent
words
folly
folly
death
lies
repeated
puckering
his
face
nesvitski
stopped
him
and
took
him
home
rostov
and
denisov
drove
away
with
the
wounded
dolokhov
the
latter
lay
silent
the
sleigh
with
closed
eyes
and
did
not
answer
word
the
questions
addressed
him
but
entering
moscow
suddenly
came
and
lifting
his
head
with
effort
took
rostov
who
was
sitting
beside
him
the
hand
rostov
was
struck
the
totally
altered
and
unexpectedly
rapturous
and
tender
expression
dolokhov
face
well
how
you
feel
asked
bad
but
not
that
friend
said
dolokhov
with
gasping
voice
where
are
moscow
know
don
matter
but
have
killed
her
killed
she
won
get
over
she
won
survive
who
asked
rostov
mother
mother
angel
adored
angel
mother
and
dolokhov
pressed
rostov
hand
and
burst
into
tears
when
had
become
little
quieter
explained
rostov
that
was
living
with
his
mother
who
she
saw
him
dying
would
not
survive
implored
rostov
and
prepare
her
rostov
went
ahead
what
was
asked
and
his
great
surprise
learned
that
dolokhov
the
brawler
dolokhov
the
bully
lived
moscow
with
old
mother
and
hunchback
sister
and
was
the
most
affectionate
sons
and
brothers
chapter
pierre
had
late
rarely
seen
his
wife
alone
both
petersburg
and
moscow
their
house
was
always
full
visitors
the
night
after
the
duel
did
not
his
bedroom
but
often
did
remained
his
father
room
that
huge
room
which
count
bezukhov
had
died
lay
down
the
sofa
meaning
fall
asleep
and
forget
all
that
had
happened
him
but
could
not
such
storm
feelings
thoughts
and
memories
suddenly
arose
within
him
that
could
not
fall
asleep
nor
even
remain
one
place
but
had
jump
and
pace
the
room
with
rapid
steps
now
seemed
see
her
the
early
days
their
marriage
with
bare
shoulders
and
languid
passionate
look
her
face
and
then
immediately
saw
beside
her
dolokhov
handsome
insolent
hard
and
mocking
face
had
seen
the
banquet
and
then
that
same
face
pale
quivering
and
suffering
had
been
when
reeled
and
sank
the
snow
what
has
happened
asked
himself
have
killed
her
lover
yes
killed
wife
lover
yes
that
was
and
why
how
did
come
because
you
married
her
answered
inner
voice
but
what
was
blame
asked
marrying
her
without
loving
her
deceiving
yourself
and
her
and
vividly
recalled
that
moment
after
supper
prince
vasili
when
spoke
those
words
had
found
difficult
utter
love
you
all
comes
from
that
even
then
felt
thought
felt
then
that
was
not
that
had
right
and
turns
out
remembered
his
honeymoon
and
blushed
the
recollection
particularly
vivid
humiliating
and
shameful
was
the
recollection
how
one
day
soon
after
his
marriage
came
out
the
bedroom
into
his
study
little
before
noon
his
silk
dressing
gown
and
found
his
head
steward
there
who
bowing
respectfully
looked
into
his
face
and
his
dressing
gown
and
smiled
slightly
expressing
respectful
understanding
his
employer
happiness
but
how
often
have
felt
proud
her
proud
her
majestic
beauty
and
social
tact
thought
been
proud
house
which
she
received
all
petersburg
proud
her
unapproachability
and
beauty
this
what
was
proud
then
thought
that
did
not
understand
her
how
often
when
considering
her
character
have
told
myself
that
was
blame
for
not
understanding
her
for
not
understanding
that
constant
composure
and
complacency
and
lack
all
interests
desires
and
the
whole
secret
lies
the
terrible
truth
that
she
depraved
woman
now
have
spoken
that
terrible
word
myself
all
has
become
clear
anatole
used
come
borrow
money
from
her
and
used
kiss
her
naked
shoulders
she
did
not
give
him
the
money
but
let
herself
kissed
her
father
jest
tried
rouse
her
jealousy
and
she
replied
with
calm
smile
that
she
was
not
stupid
jealous
let
him
what
pleases
she
used
say
one
day
asked
her
she
felt
any
symptoms
pregnancy
she
laughed
contemptuously
and
said
she
was
not
fool
want
have
children
and
that
she
was
not
going
have
any
children
then
recalled
the
coarseness
and
bluntness
her
thoughts
and
the
vulgarity
the
expressions
that
were
natural
her
though
she
had
been
brought
the
most
aristocratic
circles
not
such
fool
just
you
try
allez
vous
promener
she
used
say
often
seeing
the
success
she
had
with
young
and
old
men
and
women
pierre
could
not
understand
why
did
not
love
her
you
clear
out
this
yes
never
loved
her
said
himself
knew
she
was
depraved
woman
repeated
but
dared
not
admit
myself
and
now
there
dolokhov
sitting
the
snow
with
forced
smile
and
perhaps
dying
while
meeting
remorse
with
some
forced
bravado
pierre
was
one
those
people
who
spite
appearance
what
called
weak
character
not
seek
confidant
their
troubles
digested
his
sufferings
alone
all
all
her
fault
said
himself
but
what
that
why
did
bind
myself
her
why
did
say
vous
aime
her
which
was
lie
and
worse
than
lie
guilty
and
must
endure
what
slur
name
misfortune
for
life
that
nonsense
thought
the
slur
name
and
honor
that
all
apart
from
myself
love
you
louis
xvi
was
executed
because
they
said
was
dishonorable
and
criminal
came
into
pierre
head
and
from
their
point
view
they
were
right
were
those
too
who
canonized
him
and
died
martyr
death
for
his
sake
then
robespierre
was
beheaded
for
being
despot
who
right
and
who
wrong
one
but
you
are
alive
live
tomorrow
you
die
might
have
died
hour
ago
and
worth
tormenting
oneself
when
one
has
only
moment
life
comparison
with
eternity
but
the
moment
when
imagined
himself
calmed
such
reflections
she
suddenly
came
into
his
mind
she
was
the
moments
when
had
most
strongly
expressed
his
insincere
love
for
her
and
felt
the
blood
rush
his
heart
and
had
again
get
and
move
about
and
break
and
tear
whatever
came
his
hand
why
did
tell
her
that
vous
aime
kept
repeating
himself
and
when
had
said
for
the
tenth
time
moliere
words
mais
que
diable
allait
faire
dans
cette
galere
occurred
him
and
began
laugh
himself
but
what
the
devil
was
doing
that
galley
the
night
called
his
valet
and
told
him
pack
petersburg
could
not
imagine
how
could
speak
her
now
resolved
away
next
day
and
leave
letter
informing
her
his
intention
part
from
her
forever
next
morning
when
the
valet
came
into
the
room
with
his
coffee
pierre
was
lying
asleep
the
ottoman
with
open
book
his
hand
woke
and
looked
round
for
while
with
startled
expression
unable
realize
where
was
the
countess
told
inquire
whether
your
excellency
was
home
said
the
valet
but
before
pierre
could
decide
what
answer
would
send
the
countess
herself
white
satin
dressing
gown
embroidered
with
silver
and
with
simply
dressed
hair
two
immense
plaits
twice
round
her
lovely
head
like
coronet
entered
the
room
calm
and
majestic
except
that
there
was
wrathful
wrinkle
her
rather
prominent
marble
brow
with
her
imperturbable
calm
she
did
not
begin
speak
front
the
valet
she
knew
the
duel
and
had
come
speak
about
she
waited
till
the
valet
had
set
down
the
coffee
things
and
left
the
room
pierre
looked
her
timidly
over
his
spectacles
and
like
hare
surrounded
hounds
who
lays
back
her
ears
and
continues
crouch
motionless
before
her
enemies
tried
continue
reading
but
feeling
this
senseless
and
impossible
again
glanced
timidly
her
she
did
not
sit
down
but
looked
him
with
contemptuous
smile
waiting
for
the
valet
well
what
this
now
what
have
you
been
now
should
like
know
she
asked
sternly
what
have
stammered
pierre
seems

what

this
duel
about

pierre
turned
over
heavily
the
ottoman
and
opened
his
mouth
but
could
not
reply

raised
her
voice
and
became
more
and
more
excited
man
who

every
way
growled
pierre
frowning
without
looking
her
and
not
moving
muscle
and
how

his
company

agreeable

hoarsely

said
she
pierre
wished
say
something
looked
her
with
eyes
whose
strange
expression
she
did
not
understand
and
lay
down
again
was
suffering
physically
that
moment
there
was
weight
his
chest
and
could
not
breathe
knew
that
must
something
put

this
suffering
but
what

from

sent
through

and
all
the
searches
made
his
body
had
not
been
found
nor
was
the
list
prisoners
what
was
worst
all
for
his
relations
was
the
fact
that
there
was
still
possibility
his
having
been
picked

and
that

the

very
briefly
and
vaguely
that

brilliant
engagements
the
russians
had
had
retreat
and
had
made
their
withdrawal

order
the
old

understood
from

after
receiving
this
news
late
the
evening
when
was
alone

study
the
old
prince
went
for
his
walk
usual
next
morning
but
was
silent
with
his
steward
the
gardener
and
the
architect
and
though
looked
very
grim
said
nothing

long
remembered
the
dying
creak

wheel
which
merged
her
memory
with
what

approached

his
face
and
something
gave
way
within
her
her
eyes
grew
dim
the
expression
her
father
face
not
sad
not
crushed
but
angry
and
working
unnaturally
she
saw
that
hanging
over
her
and
about

her
was
some
terrible
misfortune

worst
life

she
had
not

said
the
ungraceful
awkward
princess
with
such
indescribable
charm
sorrow
and
self

not
bear
her
look
but
turned
away
with

hearing

words
her
face
changed
and
something
brightened

beautiful
radiant
eyes

the

with
his

tucked
without

pale
and
with
trembling

came
out
the

prince
andrew
turned
him
but
the
doctor
gave
him
bewildered
look
and
passed
without

woman
rushed
out
and
seeing
prince
andrew
stopped
hesitating
the
threshold
went
into
his
wife
room
she
was
lying
dead
the
same
position
had
seen
her
five
minutes
before
and
despite
the
fixed
eyes
and
the
pallor
the
cheeks
the
same
expression
was
her
charming
childlike
face
with
its
upper
lip
covered
with
tiny
black
hair

you
all
and
have
done
harm
anyone
and

you
done

hours
later
prince
andrew
stepping
softly
went
into
his
father
room
the
old
man
already
knew
everything
was
standing
close
the
door
and
soon
opened
his
rough
old
arms
closed
like
vise
round
his
son
neck
and
without
word
began
sob
like
child
three
days
later
the
little
princess
was
buried
and
prince
andrew
went
the
steps
where
the
coffin
stood
give
her
the
farewell
kiss
and
there
the
coffin
was
the
same
face
though
with
closed
eyes
what
have
you
done
still
seemed
say
and
prince
andrew
felt
that
something
gave
way
his
soul
and
that
was
guilty
sin
could
neither
remedy
nor
forget
could
not
weep
the
old
man
too
came
and
kissed
the
waxen
little
hands
that
lay
quietly
crossed
one

other
her
breast
and
him
too
her
face
seemed
say
what
have
you
done
and
why
and
the
sight
the
old
man
turned
angrily
away
another

days
passed
and
then
the
young
prince
nicholas

was

the

nurse
supported
the

with
her
chin
while
the
priest
with

anointed
the

red
and
wrinkled

and

his

was

and

him
over

andrew
sat
another
room
faint
with
fear
lest
the

should
drowned
the

and
awaited
the
termination
the
ceremony
looked
joyfully
the
baby
when
the
nurse
brought
him
and
nodded
approval
when
she
told
him
that

rostov
who
was
under
his
new
friend
influence
the
autumn
the
rostovs
returned
moscow
early
the
winter
denisov
also
came
back
and
stayed
with
them
the
first
half
the
winter
which
nicholas
rostov
spent
moscow
was
one
the
happiest
merriest
times
for
him
and
the
whole
family
nicholas
brought
many
young
men
his
parents
house
vera
was
handsome
girl
twenty
sonya
girl
sixteen
with
all
the
charm
opening
flower
natasha
half
grown
and
half
child
was
now
childishly
amusing
now
girlishly
enchanting
that
time
the
rostovs
house
there
prevailed
amorous
atmosphere
characteristic
homes
where
there
are
very
young
and
very
charming
girls
every
young
man
who
came
the
house
seeing
those
impressionable
smiling
young
faces
smiling
probably
their
own
happiness
feeling
the
eager
bustle
around
him
and
hearing
the
fitful
bursts
song
and
music
and
the
inconsequent
but
friendly
prattle
young
girls
ready
for
anything
and
full
hope
experienced
the
same
feeling
sharing
with
the
young
folk
the
rostovs
household
readiness
fall
love
and
expectation
happiness
among
the
young
men
introduced
rostov
one
the
first
was
dolokhov
whom
everyone
the
house
liked
except
natasha
she
almost
quarreled
with
her
brother
about
him
she
insisted
that
was
bad
man
and
that
the
duel
with
bezukhov
pierre
was
right
and
dolokhov
wrong
and
further
that
was
disagreeable
and
unnatural
there
nothing
for
understand
she
cried
out
with
resolute
self
will
wicked
and
heartless
there
now
like
your
denisov
though
rake
and
all
that
still
like
him
you
see
understand
don
know
how
put
with
this
one
everything
calculated
and
don
like
that
but
denisov
denisov
quite
different
replied
nicholas
implying
that
even
denisov
was
nothing
compared
dolokhov
you
must
understand
what
soul
there
dolokhov
you
should
see
him
with
his
mother
what
heart
well
don
know
about
that
but
uncomfortable
with
him
and
you
know
has
fallen
love
with
sonya
what
nonsense
certain
you
see
natasha
prediction
proved
true
dolokhov
who
did
not
usually
care
for
the
society
ladies
began
come
often
the
house
and
the
question
for
whose
sake
came
though
one
spoke
was
soon
settled
came
because
sonya
and
sonya
though
she
would
never
have
dared
say
knew
and
blushed
scarlet
every
time
dolokhov
appeared
dolokhov
often
dined
the
rostovs
never
missed
performance
which
they
were
present
and
went
iogel
balls
for
young
people
which
the
rostovs
always
attended
was
pointedly
attentive
sonya
and
looked
her
such
way
that
not
only
could
she
not
bear
his
glances
without
coloring
but
even
the
old
countess
and
natasha
blushed
when
they
saw
his
looks
was
evident
that
this
strange
strong
man
was
under
the
irresistible
influence
the
dark
graceful
girl
who
loved
another
rostov
noticed
something
new
dolokhov
relations
with
sonya
but
did
not
explain
himself
what
these
new
relations
were
they
always
love
with
someone
thought
sonya
and
natasha
but
was
not
much
ease
with
sonya
and
dolokhov
before
and
was
less
frequently
home
the
autumn
everybody
had
again
begun
talking
the
war
with
napoleon
with
even
greater
warmth
than
the
year
before
orders
were
given
raise
recruits
ten
men
every
thousand
for
the
regular
army
and
besides
this
nine
men
every
thousand
for
the
militia
everywhere
bonaparte
was
anathematized
and
moscow
nothing
but
the
coming
war
was
talked
for
the
rostov
family
the
whole
interest
these
preparations
for
war
lay
the
fact
that
nicholas
would
not
hear
remaining
moscow
and
only
awaited
the
termination
denisov
furlough
after
christmas
return
with
him
their
regiment
his
approaching
departure
did
not
prevent
his
amusing
himself
but
rather
gave
zest
his
pleasures
spent
the
greater
part
his
time
away
from
home
dinners
parties
and
balls
chapter
the
third
day
after
christmas
nicholas
dined
home
thing
had
rarely
done
late
was
grand
farewell
dinner
and
denisov
were
leaving
join
their
regiment
after
epiphany
about
twenty
people
were
present
including
dolokhov
and
denisov
never
had
love
been
much
the
air
and
never
had
the
amorous
atmosphere
made
itself
strongly
felt
the
rostovs
house
this
holiday
time
seize
the
moments
happiness
love
and
loved
that
the
only
reality
the
world
all
else
folly
the
one
thing
are
interested
here
said
the
spirit
the
place
nicholas
having
usual
exhausted
two
pairs
horses
without
visiting
all
the
places
meant
and
where
had
been
invited
returned
home
just
before
dinner
soon
entered
noticed
and
felt
the
tension
the
amorous
air
the
house
and
also
noticed
curious
embarrassment
among
some
those
present
sonya
dolokhov
and
the
old
countess
were
especially
disturbed
and
lesser
degree
natasha
nicholas
understood
that
something
must
have
happened
between
sonya
and
dolokhov
before
dinner
and
with
the
kindly
sensitiveness
natural
him
was
very
gentle
and
wary
with
them
both
dinner
that
same
evening
there
was
one
the
balls
that
iogel
the
dancing
master
gave
for
his
pupils
during
the
holidays
nicholas
will
you
come
iogel
please
said
natasha
asked
you
and
vasili
dmitrich
also
going
denisov
where
would
not
the
countess
command
said
denisov
who
the
rostovs
had
jocularly
assumed
the
role
natasha
knight
even
weady
dance
the
pas
chale
have
time
answered
nicholas
but
promised
the
arkharovs
they
have
party
and
you
asked
dolokhov
but
soon
had
asked
the
question
noticed
that
should
not
have
been
put
perhaps
coldly
and
angrily
replied
dolokhov
glancing
sonya
and
scowling
gave
nicholas
just
such
look
had
given
pierre
the
club
dinner
there
something
thought
nicholas
and
was
further
confirmed
this
conclusion
the
fact
that
dolokhov
left
immediately
after
dinner
called
natasha
and
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
and
was
looking
for
you
said
natasha
running
out
him
told
you
but
you
would
not
believe
she
said
triumphantly
has
proposed
sonya
little
nicholas
had
occupied
himself
with
sonya
late
something
seemed
give
way
within
him
this
news
dolokhov
was
suitable
and
some
respects
brilliant
match
for
the
dowerless
orphan
girl
from
the
point
view
the
old
countess
and
society
was
out
the
question
for
her
refuse
him
and
therefore
nicholas
first
feeling
hearing
the
news
was
one
anger
with
sonya
tried
say
that
capital
course
she
forget
her
childish
promises
and
accept
the
offer
but
before
had
time
say
natasha
began
again
and
fancy
she
refused
him
quite
definitely
adding
after
pause
she
told
him
she
loved
another
yes
sonya
could
not
have
done
otherwise
thought
nicholas
much
mamma
pressed
her
she
refused
and
know
she
won
change
once
she
has
said
and
mamma
pressed
her
said
nicholas
reproachfully
yes
said
natasha
you
know
nicholas
don
angry
but
know
you
will
not
marry
her
know
heaven
knows
how
but
know
for
certain
that
you
won
marry
her
now
you
don
know
that
all
said
nicholas
but
must
talk
her
what
darling
sonya
added
with
smile
she
indeed
darling
send
her
you
and
natasha
kissed
her
brother
and
ran
away
minute
later
sonya
came
with
frightened
guilty
and
scared
look
nicholas
went
her
and
kissed
her
hand
this
was
the
first
time
since
his
return
that
they
had
talked
alone
and
about
their
love
sophie
began
timidly
first
and
then
more
and
more
boldly
you
wish
refuse
one
who
not
only
brilliant
and
advantageous
match
but
splendid
noble
fellow
friend
sonya
interrupted
him
have
already
refused
she
said
hurriedly
you
are
refusing
for
sake
afraid
that
sonya
again
interrupted
she
gave
him
imploring
frightened
look
nicholas
don
tell
that
she
said
but
must
may
arrogant
but
still
best
say
you
refuse
him
account
must
tell
you
the
whole
truth
love
you
and
think
love
you
more
than
anyone
else
that
enough
for
said
sonya
blushing
but
have
been
love
thousand
times
and
shall
fall
love
again
though
for
one
have
such
feeling
friendship
confidence
and
love

then
young
mamma

not

nicholas
again
kissed
her
hand

iogel
were
the
most
enjoyable
balls
moscow
said
the
mothers
they
watched
their
young
people
executing
their
newly
learned
steps
and
said
the
youths
and
maidens
themselves
they
danced
till
they
were
ready
drop
and
said
the
grown
young
men
and
women
who
came
these
balls
with
air
condescension
and
found
them
most
enjoyable
that
year
two
marriages
had
come
these
balls
the
two
pretty
young
princesses
gorchakov
met
suitors
there
and
were
married
and
further
increased
the
fame
these
dances
what
distinguished
them
from
others
was
the
absence
host
hostess
and
the
presence
the
good
natured
iogel
flying
about
like
feather
and
bowing
according
the
rules
his
art
collected
the
tickets
from
all
his
visitors
there
was
the
fact
that
only
those
came
who
wished
dance
and
amuse
themselves
girls
thirteen
and
fourteen
who
are
wearing
long
dresses
for
the
first
time
with
scarcely
any
exceptions
they
all
were
seemed
pretty
rapturous
were
their
smiles
and
sparkling
their
eyes
sometimes
the
best
the
pupils
whom
natasha
who
was
exceptionally
graceful
was
first
even
danced
the
pas

but
this
last
ball
only
the
ecossaise
the
anglaise
and
the
mazurka
which
was
just
coming
into
fashion
were
danced
iogel
had
taken
ballroom
bezukhov
house
and
the
ball
everyone
said
was
great
success
there
were
many
pretty
girls
and
the
rostov
girls
were
among
the
prettiest
they
were
both
particularly
happy
and
gay
that
evening
proud
dolokhov
proposal
her
refusal
and
her
explanation
with
nicholas
sonya
twirled
about
before
she
left
home
that
the
maid
could
hardly
get
her
hair
plaited
and
she
was
transparently
radiant
with
impulsive
joy
natasha
less
proud
her
first
long
dress
and
being
real
ball
was
even
happier
they
were
both
dressed
white
muslin
with
pink
ribbons
natasha
fell
love
the
very
moment
she
entered
the
ballroom
she
was
not
love
with
anyone
particular
but
with
everyone
whatever
person
she
happened
look
she
was
love
with
for
that
moment
how
delightful
she
kept
saying
running
sonya
nicholas
and
denisov
were
walking
and
down
looking
with
kindly
patronage
the
dancers
how
sweet
she
she
will
weal
beauty
said
denisov
who
countess
natasha
answered
denisov
and
how
she
dances
what
gwace
said
again
after
pause
who
are
you
talking
about
about
your
sister
ejaculated
denisov
testily
rostov

down

old
ladies
and
leaning
his
saber
and
beating
time
with
his
foot
told

funny
and
kept
them
amused
while
watched
the
young
people
dancing

with
natasha
his
pride
and
his
best

noiselessly
skillfully
stepping

flew
first
across
the
hall
with
natasha
who
though
shy
went
carefully
executing
her
steps
denisov
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
and
beat
time
with
his
saber
way
that
clearly
indicated
that

rose
and
tripping
rapidly
across
her
little
shoes
trimmed
with
bows
ran
timidly
the
corner
where
denisov
sat
she
saw
that
everybody
was
looking
her
and
waiting
nicholas
saw
that
denisov
was

denisov
and
unhooked
his
saber
came
out
from
behind
the
chairs
clasped
his
partner
hand
firmly
threw
back
his
head
and
advanced
his
foot
waiting
for
the
beat
only
horse
back
and
the
mazurka
was
denisov
short
stature
not
noticeable
and
looked
the
fine
fellow
felt
himself
the
right
beat
the
music
looked
sideways
his
partner
with
merry
and
triumphant
air
suddenly
stamped
with
one
foot
bounded
from
the
floor
like
ball
and
flew
round
the
room
taking
his
partner
with
him
glided
silently
one
foot
half
across
the
room
and
seeming
not
notice
the
chairs
was
dashing
straight
them
when
suddenly
clinking
his
spurs
and
spreading
out
his
legs
stopped
short
his
heels
stood
second
stamped
the
spot
clanking
his
spurs
whirled
rapidly
round
and
striking
his
left
heel
against
his
right
flew
round
again
circle
natasha
guessed
what
meant
and
abandoning
herself
him
followed
his
lead
hardly
knowing
how
first
spun
her
round
holding
her
now
with
his
left
now
with
his
right
hand
then
falling
one
knee
twirled
her
round
him
and
again
jumping
dashed
impetuously
forward
that
seemed
would
rush
through
the
whole
suite
rooms
without
drawing
breath
and
then
suddenly
stopped
and
performed
some
new
and
unexpected
steps
when
last
smartly
whirling
his
partner
round
front
her
chair
drew
with
click
his
spurs
and
bowed
her
natasha
did
not
even
make
him
curtsy
she
fixed
her
eyes
him
amazement
smiling
she
did
not
recognize
him
what
does
this
mean
she
brought
out
although
iogel
did
not
acknowledge
this
the
real
mazurka
everyone
was
delighted
with
denisov
skill
was
asked
again
and
again
partner
and
the
old
men
began
smilingly
talk
about
poland
and
the
good
old
days
denisov
flushed
after
the
mazurka
and
mopping
himself
with
his
handkerchief
sat
down
natasha
and
did
not
leave
her
for
the
rest
the
evening
chapter
xiii
for
two
days
after
that
rostov
did
not
see
dolokhov
his
own
dolokhov
home
the
third
day

clock
rostov
went
the
english
hotel
straight
from
the
theater
where
had
been
with
his
family
and
denisov
was
once
shown
the
best
room
which
dolokhov
had
taken
for
that
evening
some
twenty
men
were
gathered
round
table
which
dolokhov
sat
between
two
candles
the
table
was
pile
gold
and
paper
money
and
was
keeping
the
bank
rostov
had
not
seen
him
since
his
proposal
and
sonya
refusal
and
felt
uncomfortable
the
thought
how
they
would
meet
dolokhov
clear
cold
glance
met
rostov
soon
entered
the
door
though
had
long
expected
him
long
time
since
met
said
thanks
for
coming
just
finish
dealing
and
then
ilyushka
will
come
with
his
chorus
called
once
twice
your
house
said
rostov
reddening
dolokhov
made
reply

may
punt
said
rostov
recalled
that
moment
strange
conversation
had
once
had
with
dolokhov
none
but
fools
trust
luck
play
dolokhov
had
then
said
are
you
afraid
play
with
dolokhov
now
asked
guessing
rostov
thought
beneath
his
smile
rostov
saw
him
the
mood
had
shown
the
club
dinner
and
other
times
when
tired
everyday
life
had
felt
need
escape
from
some
strange
and
usually
cruel
action
rostov
felt
ill
ease
tried
but
failed
find
some
joke
with
which
reply
dolokhov
words
but
before
had
thought
anything
dolokhov
looking
straight
his
face
said
slowly
and
deliberately
that
everyone
could
hear
you
remember
had
talk
about
cards
fool
who
trusts
luck
one
should
make
certain
and
want
try

certainty
rostov
asked
himself

not

dolokhov
added
and
springing
new
pack
cards
said
bank
gentlemen
moving
the
money
forward
prepared
deal
rostov
sat
down
his
side
and
first
did
not
play
dolokhov
kept
glancing
him
why
don
you
play
asked
and
strange
say
nicholas
felt
that
could
not
help
taking
card
putting
small
stake
and
beginning
play
have
money
with
said
trust
you
rostov
staked
five
rubles
card
and
lost
staked
again
and
again
lost
dolokhov
killed
that
beat
ten
cards
rostov
running
gentlemen
said
dolokhov
after
had
dealt
for
some
time
please

get
muddled
the
reckoning
one
the
players
said
hoped

trusted
yes

but
afraid
getting
the
accounts
mixed
ask

replied
dolokhov

afterwards
added
turning
rostov

kept
handing
round

and
had
eight

him
wrote

card
but
while
the
waiter
filled
his
glass
changed
his
mind
and
altered
his
usual
stake
twenty
rubles
leave
said
dolokhov
though
did
not
seem
even
looking
rostov
you
win
back
all
the
sooner
lose
the
others
but
win
from
you
are
you
afraid
asked
again
rostov
submitted
let
the
eight
hundred
remain
and
laid
down
seven
hearts
with
torn
corner
which
had
picked
from
the
floor
well
remembered
that
seven
afterwards
laid
down
the
seven
hearts
which
with
broken
bit
chalk
had
written
rubles
clear
upright
figures
emptied
the
glass
warm
champagne
that
was
handed
him
smiled
dolokhov
words
and
with
sinking
heart
waiting
for
seven
turn
gazed
dolokhov
hands
which
held
the
pack
much
depended
rostov
winning
losing
that
seven
hearts
the
previous
sunday
the
old
count
had
given
his
son
two
thousand
rubles
and
though
always
disliked
speaking
money
difficulties
had
told
nicholas
that
this
was
all
could
let
him
have
till
may
and
asked
him
more
economical
this
time
nicholas
had
replied
that
would
more
than
enough
for
him
and
that
gave
his
word
honor
not
take
anything
more
till
the
spring
now
only
twelve
hundred
rubles
was
left
that
money
that
this
seven
hearts
meant
for
him
not
only
the
loss
sixteen
hundred
rubles
but
the
necessity
going
back
his
word
with
sinking
heart
watched
dolokhov
hands
and
thought
now
then
make
haste
and
let
have
this
card
and
take
cap
and
drive
home
supper
with
denisov
natasha
and
sonya
and
will
certainly
never
touch
card
again
that
moment
his
home
life
jokes
with
petya
talks
with
sonya
duets
with
natasha
piquet
with
his
father
and
even
his
comfortable
bed
the
house
the
povarskaya
rose
before
him
with
such
vividness
clearness
and
charm
that
seemed
were
all
lost
and
unappreciated
bliss
long
past
could
not
conceive
that
stupid
chance
letting
the
seven
dealt
the
right
rather
than
the
left
might
deprive
him
all
this
happiness
newly
appreciated
and
newly
illumined
and
plunge
him
into
the
depths
unknown
and
undefined
misery
that
could
not
yet
awaited
with
sinking
heart
the
movement
dolokhov
hands
those
broad
reddish
hands
with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
cuffs
laid
down
the
pack
and
took
glass
and
pipe
that
were
handed
him
you
are
not
afraid
play
with
repeated
dolokhov
and
about
tell
good
story
put
down
the
cards
leaned
back
his
chair
and
began
deliberately
with
smile
yes
gentlemen
been
told
there
rumor
going
about
moscow
that
sharper
advise
you
careful
come
now
deal
exclaimed
rostov
those
moscow
gossips
said
dolokhov
and
took
the
cards
with
smile
aah
rostov
almost
screamed
lifting
both
hands
his
head
the
seven
needed
was
lying
uppermost
the
first
card
the
pack
had
lost
more
than
could
pay
still
don
ruin
yourself
said
dolokhov
with
side
glance
rostov
continued
deal
chapter
xiv
hour
and
half
later
most
the
players
were
but
little
interested
their
own
play
the
whole
interest
was
concentrated
rostov
instead
sixteen
hundred
rubles
had
long
column
figures
scored
against
him
which
had
reckoned
ten
thousand
but
that
now
vaguely
supposed
must
have
risen
fifteen
thousand
reality
already
exceeded
twenty
thousand
rubles
dolokhov
was
longer
listening
stories
telling
them
but
followed
every
movement
rostov
hands
and
occasionally
ran
his
eyes
over
the
score
against
him
had
decided
play
until
that
score
reached
forty
three
thousand
had
fixed
that
number
because
forty
three
was
the
sum
his
and
sonya
joint
ages
rostov
leaning
his
head
both
hands
sat
the
table
which
was
scrawled
over
with
figures
wet
with
spilled
wine
and
littered
with
cards
one
tormenting
impression
did
not
leave
him
that
those
broad
boned
reddish
hands
with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
sleeves
those
hands
which
loved
and
hated
held
him
their
power
six
hundred
rubles
ace
corner
nine
winning
back
impossible
how
pleasant
was
home
the
knave
double
quits
can
and
why
doing
this
rostov
pondered
sometimes
staked
large
sum
but
dolokhov
refused
accept
and
fixed
the
stake
himself
nicholas
submitted
him
and
one
moment
prayed
god
had
done
the
battlefield
the
bridge
over
the
enns
and
then
guessed
that
the
card
that
came
first
hand
from
the
crumpled
heap
under
the
table
would
save
him
now
counted
the
cords
his
coat
and
took
card
with
that
number
and
tried
staking
the
total
his
losses
then
looked
round
for
aid
from
the
other
players
peered
the
now
cold
face
dolokhov
and
tried
read
what
was
passing
his
mind
knows
course
what
this
loss
means
can
want
ruin
wasn
friend
wasn
fond
him
but
not
his
fault
what
has
such
luck
and
not
fault
either
thought
himself
have
done
nothing
wrong
have
killed
anyone
insulted
wished
harm
anyone
why
such
terrible
misfortune
and
when
did
begin
such
little
while
ago
came
this
table
with
the
thought
winning
hundred
rubles
buy
that
casket
for
mamma
name
day
and
then
going
home
was
happy
free
lighthearted
and
did
not
realize
how
happy
was
when
did
that
end
and
when
did
this
new
terrible
state
things
begin
what
marked
the
change
sat
all
the
time
this
same
place
this
table
chose
and
placed
cards
and
watched
those
broad
boned
agile
hands
the
same
way
when
did
happen
and
what
has
happened
well
and
strong
and
still
the
same
and
the
same
place
can
surely
will
all
end
nothing
was
flushed
and
bathed
perspiration
though
the
room
was
not
hot
his
face
was
terrible
and
piteous
see
especially
from
its
helpless
efforts
seem
calm
the
score
against
him
reached
the
fateful
sum
forty
three
thousand
rostov
had
just
prepared
card
bending
the
corner
which
meant
double
the
three
thousand
just
put
down
his
score
when
dolokhov
slamming
down
the
pack
cards
put
aside
and
began
rapidly
adding
the
total
rostov
debt
breaking
the
chalk
marked
the
figures
his
clear
bold
hand
supper
time
for
supper
and
here
are
the
gypsies
some
swarthy
men
and
women
were
really
entering
from
the
cold
outside
and
saying
something
their
gypsy
accents
nicholas
understood
that
was
all
over
but
said
indifferent
tone
well
won
you
had
splendid
card
all
ready

the
fun
the
game
which
interested
him
most
all
lost
thought
now
bullet
through
brain
that
all
that
left
and
the
same
time
said
cheerful
voice
come
now
just
this
one
more
little
card
all
right
said
dolokhov
having
finished
the
addition
all
right
twenty
one
rubles
said
pointing
the
figure
twenty
one
which
the
total
exceeded
the
round
sum
forty
three
thousand
and
taking
pack
prepared
deal
rostov
submissively
unbent
the
corner
his
card
and
instead
the
six
thousand
had
intended
carefully
wrote
twenty
one
all
the
same
said
only
want
see
whether
you
will
let
win
this
ten
beat
dolokhov
began
deal
seriously
how
rostov
detested
that
moment
those
hands
with
their
short
reddish
fingers
and
hairy
wrists
which
held
him
their
power
the
ten
fell

said
dolokhov
and
stretching
himself
rose
from
the
table
one
does
get
tired
sitting
long
added

rostov
dolokhov
cut
him

into
the
drawing
room
where
saw

his
mother
with
the
old
lady
and
here
nicholas
cried
natasha
running

natasha
without

called
the
old
countess
from
the
drawing
room
nicholas
went
her
kissed
her
hand
and
sitting
down
silently
her
table
began
watch
her
hands
arranging
the
cards
from
the
dancing
room
they
still
heard
the
laughter
and
merry
voices
trying
persuade
natasha
sing
all
wight
all
wight
shouted
denisov
good
making
excuses

your
turn

cawolla
entweat

the
countess
glanced
her
silent
son
what
the
matter
she
asked
nothing
said
weary
being
continually
asked
the
same
question
will
papa
back
soon
expect
everything
the
same
with
them
they
know
nothing
about
where
thought
nicholas
and
went
again
into
the
dancing
room
where
the
clavichord
stood
sonya
was
sitting
the
clavichord
playing
the
prelude
denisov
favorite
barcarolle
natasha
was
preparing
sing
denisov
was
looking
her
with
enraptured
eyes
nicholas
began
pacing
and
down
the
room
why
they
want
make
her
sing
how
can
she
sing
there
nothing
happy
about
thought
sonya
struck
the
first
chord
the
prelude
god
ruined
and
dishonored
man
bullet
through
brain
the
only
thing
left
not
singing
his
thoughts
ran
away
but
where
one
let
them
sing
continued
pace
the
room
looking
gloomily
denisov
and
the
girls
and
avoiding
their
eyes
nikolenka
what
the
matter
sonya
eyes
fixed
him
seemed
ask
she
noticed
once
that
something
had
happened
him
nicholas
turned
away
from
her
natasha
too
with
her
quick
instinct
had
instantly
noticed
her
brother
condition
but
though
she
noticed
she
was
herself
such
high
spirits
that
moment
far
from
sorrow
sadness
self
reproach
that
she
purposely
deceived
herself
young
people
often
too
happy
now
spoil
enjoyment
sympathy
with
anyone
sorrow
she
felt
and
she
said
herself
must
mistaken
must
feeling
happy
just
now
sonya
she
said
going
the
very
middle
the
room
where
she
considered
the
resonance
was
best
having
lifted
her
head
and
let
her
arms
droop
lifelessly
ballet
dancers
natasha
rising
energetically
from
her
heels
her
toes
stepped
the
middle
the
room
and
stood
still
yes
that
she
seemed
say
answering
the
rapt
gaze
with
which
denisov
followed
her
and
what
she
pleased
about
thought
nicholas
looking
his
sister
why
isn
she
dull
and
ashamed
natasha
took
the
first
note
her
throat
swelled
her
chest
rose
her
eyes
became
serious
that
moment
she
was
oblivious
her
surroundings
and
from
her
smiling
lips
flowed
sounds
which
anyone
may
produce
the
same
intervals
and
hold
for
the
same
time
but
which
leave
you
cold
thousand
times
and
the
thousand
and
first
time
thrill
you
and
make
you
weep
natasha
that
winter
had
for
the
first
time
begun
sing
seriously
mainly
because
denisov
delighted
her
singing
she
longer
sang
child
there
was
longer
her
singing
that
comical
childish
painstaking
effect
that
had
been
before
but
she
did
not
yet
sing
well
all
the
connoisseurs
who
heard
her
said
not
trained
but
beautiful
voice
that
must
trained
only
they
generally
said
this
some
time
after
she
had
finished
singing
while
that
untrained
voice
with
its
incorrect
breathing
and
labored
transitions
was
sounding
even
the
connoisseurs
said
nothing
but
only
delighted
and
wished
hear
again
her
voice
there
was
virginal
freshness
unconsciousness
her
own
powers
and
yet
untrained
velvety
softness
which
mingled
with
her
lack
art
singing
that
seemed
nothing
that
voice
could
altered
without
spoiling
what
this
thought
nicholas
listening
her
with
widely
opened
eyes
what
has
happened
her
how
she
singing
today
and
suddenly
the
whole
world
centered
for
him
anticipation
the
next
note
the
next
phrase
and
everything
the
world
was
divided
into
three
beats
mio
crudele
affetto
one
two
three
one
two
three
one
mio
crudele
affetto
one
two
three
one
this
senseless
life
ours
thought
nicholas
all
this
misery
and
money
and
dolokhov
and
anger
and
honor
all
nonsense
but
this
real
now
then
natasha
now
then
dearest
now
then
darling
how
will
she
take
that
she
taken
thank
god
and
without
noticing
that
was
singing
strengthen
the
sung
second
third
below
the
high
note
god
how
fine
did
really
take
how
fortunate
thought
how
that
chord
vibrated
and
how
moved
was
something
that
was
finest
rostov
soul
and
this
something
was
apart
from
everything
else
the
world
and
above
everything
the
world
what
were
losses
and
dolokhov
and
words
honor
all
nonsense
one
might
kill
and
rob
and
yet
happy
chapter
xvi
was
long
since
rostov
had
felt
such
enjoyment
from
music
did
that
day
but
sooner
had
natasha
finished
her
barcarolle
than
reality
again
presented
itself
got
without
saying
word
and
went
downstairs
his
own
room
quarter
hour
later
the
old
count
came
from
his
club
cheerful
and
contented
nicholas
hearing
him
drive
went
meet
him
well
had
good
time
said
the
old
count
smiling
gaily
and
proudly
his
son
nicholas
tried
say
yes
but
could
not
and
nearly
burst
into
sobs
the
count
was
lighting
his
pipe
and
did
not
notice
his
son
condition
can
avoided
thought
nicholas
for
the
first
and
last
time
and
suddenly
the
most
casual
tone
which
made
him
feel
ashamed
himself
said
merely
asking
his
father
let
him
have
the
carriage
drive
town
papa
have
come
matter
business
was
nearly
forgetting
need
some
money

said
his
father
who
was
specially
good
humor
told

much

said
nicholas
flushing
and
with
stupid
careless
smile
for

was
long
unable
forgive
himself
have
lost
little
mean
good
deal
great

forty
three
thousand
what

cried
the
count
suddenly
reddening
with
apoplectic
flush
over
neck
and
nape
old
people
promised
pay
tomorrow
said
nicholas
well
said
the
old
count
spreading
out
his
arms
and
sinking
helplessly
the
sofa
can
helped
happens
everyone
said
the
son
with
bold
free
and
easy
tone
while
his
soul
regarded
himself
worthless
scoundrel
whose
whole
life
could
not
atone
for
his
crime
longed
kiss
his
father
hands
and
kneel
beg
his
forgiveness
but
said
careless
and
even
rude
voice
that
happens
everyone
the
old
count
cast
down
his
eyes
hearing
his
son
words
and
began
bustlingly
searching
for
something
yes
yes
muttered
will
difficult
fear
difficult
raise
happens
everybody
yes
who
has
not
done
and
with
furtive
glance
his
son
face
the
count
went
out
the
room
nicholas
had
been
prepared
for
resistance
but
had
not
all
expected
this
papa
called
after
him
sobbing
forgive
and
seizing
his
father
hand
pressed
his
lips
and
burst
into
tears
while
father
and
son
were
having
their
explanation
the
mother
and
daughter
were
having
one
not
less
important

tell

and
you
listen
the
door
and
natasha
ran
across
the
drawing
room
the
dancing
hall
where
denisov
was
sitting
the
same
chair
the
clavichord
with
his
face
his
hands
jumped

step

denisov
bent
over
her
hand
and
she
heard
strange
sounds
she
did
not
understand
she
kissed
his
rough
curly
black
head
this
instant
they
heard
the
quick
rustle
the
countess
dress
she
came
them
vasili
dmitrich
thank
you
for
the
honor
she
said
with
embarrassed
voice
though
sounded
severe
denisov
but

and
thought
that

have
addressed

not

obliged

refusal
countess
said
denisov
with
downcast
eyes
and
guilty
face
tried
say
more
but
faltered
natasha
could
not
remain
calm
seeing
him
such
plight
she
began
sob
aloud
countess

denisov
went
unsteady
voice
but

your
daughter
and
all
your

twice
over
looked
the
countess
and
seeing
her
severe
face
said
well
good
countess
and
kissing
her
hand
left
the
room
with
quick
resolute
strides
without
looking
natasha
next
day
rostov
saw
denisov
off
did
not
wish
stay
another
day
moscow
all
denisov
moscow
friends
gave
him
farewell
entertainment
the
gypsies
with
the
result
that
had
recollection
how
was
put
the
sleigh
the
first
three
stages
his
journey
after
denisov
departure
rostov
spent
another
fortnight
moscow
without
going
out
the
house
waiting
for
the
money
his
father
could
not
once
raise
and
spent
most
his
time
the
girls
room
sonya
was
more
tender
and
devoted
him
than
ever
was
she
wanted
show
him
that
his
losses
were
achievement
that
made
her
love
him
all
the
more
but
nicholas
now
considered
himself
unworthy
her
filled
the
girls
albums
with
verses
and
music
and
having
last
sent
dolokhov
the
whole
forty
three
thousand
rubles
and
received
his
receipt
left
the
end
november
without
taking
leave
any
his
acquaintances
overtake
his
regiment
which
was
already
poland
book
five
chapter
after
his
interview
with
his
wife
pierre
left
for
petersburg
the
torzhok
post
station
either
there
were
horses
the
postmaster
would
not
supply
them
pierre
was
obliged
wait
without
undressing
lay
down
the
leather
sofa
front
round
table
put
his
big
feet
their
overboots
the
table
and
began
reflect
will
you
have
the
portmanteaus
brought
and
bed
got
ready
and
tea
asked
his
valet
pierre
gave
answer
for
neither
heard
nor
saw
anything
had
begun
think
the
last
station
and
was
still
pondering
the
same
question
one
important
that
took
notice
what
went
around
him
not
only
was
indifferent
whether
got
petersburg
earlier
later
whether
secured
accommodation
this
station
but
compared
the
thoughts
that
now
occupied
him
was
matter
indifference
whether
remained
there
for
few
hours
for
the
rest
his
life
the
postmaster
his
wife
the
valet
and
peasant
woman
selling
torzhok
embroidery
came
into
the
room
offering
their
services
without
changing
his
careless
attitude
pierre
looked
them
over
his
spectacles
unable
understand
what
they
wanted
how
they
could
living
without
having
solved
the
problems
that
absorbed
him
had
been
engrossed
the
same
thoughts
ever
since
the
day
returned
from
sokolniki
after
the
duel
and
had
spent
that
first
agonizing
sleepless
night
but
now
the
solitude
the
journey
they
seized
him
with
special
force
matter
what
thought
about
always
returned
these
same
questions
which
could
not
solve
and
yet
could
not
cease
ask
himself
was
the
thread
the
chief
screw
which
held
his
life
together
were
stripped
that
the
screw
could
not
get
out
but
went
turning
uselessly
the
same
place
the
postmaster
came
and
began
obsequiously
beg
his
excellency
wait
only
two
hours
when
come
what
might
would
let
his
excellency
have
the
courier
horses
was
plain
that
was
lying
and
only
wanted
get
more
money
from
the
traveler
this
good
bad
pierre
asked
himself
good
for
bad
for
another
traveler
and
for
himself
unavoidable
because
needs
money
for
food
the
man
said
officer
had
once
given
him
thrashing
for
letting
private
traveler
have
the
courier
horses
but
the
officer
thrashed
him
because
had
get
quickly
possible
and
continued
pierre
shot
dolokhov
because
considered
myself
injured
and
louis
xvi
was
executed
because
they
considered
him
criminal
and
year
later
they
executed
those
who
executed
him
also
for
some
reason
what
bad
what
good
what
should
one
love
and
what
hate
what
does
one
live
for
and
what
what
life
and
what
death
what
power
governs
all
there
was
answer
any
these
questions
except
one
and
that
not
logical
answer
and
not
all
reply
them
the
answer
was
you
die
and
all
will
end
you
die
and
know
all
cease
asking
but
dying
was
also
dreadful
the
torzhok
peddler
woman
whining
voice
went
offering
her
wares
especially
pair
goatskin
slippers
have
hundreds
rubles
don
know
what
with
and
she
stands
her
tattered
cloak
looking
timidly
thought
and
what
does
she
want
the
money
for
that
money
could
add
hair
breadth
happiness
peace
mind
can
anything
the
world
make
her
less
prey
evil
and
death
death
which
ends
all
and
must
come
today
tomorrow
any
rate
instant
compared
with
eternity
and
again
twisted
the
screw
with
the
stripped
thread
and
again
turned
uselessly
the
same
place
his
servant
handed
him
half
cut
novel
the
form
letters
madame
souza
began
reading
about
the
sufferings
and
virtuous
struggles
certain
emilie
mansfeld
and
why
did
she
resist
her
seducer
when
she
loved
him
thought
god
could
not
have
put
into
her
heart
impulse
that
was
against
his
will
wife
she
once
was
did
not
struggle
and
perhaps
she
was
right
nothing
has
been
found
out
nothing
discovered
pierre
again
said
himself
all
can
know
that
know
nothing
and
that
the
height
human
wisdom
everything
within
and
around
him
seemed
confused
senseless
and
repellent
yet
this
very
repugnance
all
his
circumstances
pierre
found
kind
tantalizing
satisfaction
make
bold
ask
your
excellency
move
little
for
this
gentleman
said
the
postmaster
entering
the
room
followed
another
traveler
also
detained
for
lack
horses
the
newcomer
was
short
large
boned
yellow
faced
wrinkled
old
man
with
gray
bushy
eyebrows
overhanging
bright
eyes
indefinite
grayish
color
pierre
took
his
feet
off
the
table
stood
and
lay
down
bed
that
had
been
got
ready
for
him
glancing
now
and
then
the
newcomer
who
with
gloomy
and
tired
face
was
wearily
taking
off
his
wraps
with
the
aid
his
servant
and
not
looking
pierre
with
pair
felt
boots
his
thin
bony
legs
and
keeping
worn
nankeen
covered
sheepskin
coat
the
traveler
sat
down
the
sofa
leaned
back
his
big
head
with
its
broad
temples
and
close
cropped
hair
and
looked
bezukhov
the
stern
shrewd
and
penetrating
expression
that
look
struck
pierre
felt
wish
speak
the
stranger
but
the
time
had
made
his
mind
ask
him
question
about
the
roads
the
traveler
had
closed
his
eyes
his
shriveled
old
hands
were
folded
and
the
finger
one
them
pierre
noticed
large
cast
iron
ring
with
seal
representing
death
head
the
stranger
sat
without
stirring
either
resting
seemed
pierre
sunk
profound
and
calm
meditation
his
servant
was
also
yellow
wrinkled
old
man
without
beard
mustache
evidently
not
because
was
shaven
but
because
they
had
never
grown
this
active
old
servant
was
unpacking
the
traveler
canteen
and
preparing
tea
brought
boiling
samovar
when
everything
was
ready
the
stranger
opened
his
eyes
moved
the
table
filled
tumbler
with
tea
for
himself
and
one
for
the
beardless
old
man
whom
passed
pierre
began
feel
sense
uneasiness
and
the
need
even
the
inevitability
entering
into
conversation
with
this
stranger
the
servant
brought
back
his
tumbler
turned
upside
down
with
unfinished
bit
nibbled
sugar
and
asked
anything
more

indicate
did
not
want
more
tea
give
the
book
said
the
stranger
the
servant
handed
him
book
which
pierre
took
devotional
work
and
the
traveler
became
absorbed
pierre
looked
him
all
once
the
stranger
closed
the
book
putting
marker
and
again
leaning
with
his
arms
the
back
the
sofa
sat
his
former
position
with
his
eyes
shut
pierre
looked
him
and
had
not
time
turn
away
when
the
old
man
opening
his
eyes
fixed
his
steady
and
severe
gaze
straight
pierre
face
pierre
felt
confused
and
wished
avoid
that
look
but
the
bright
old
eyes
attracted
him
irresistibly
chapter
have
the
pleasure
addressing
count
bezukhov
not
mistaken
said
the
stranger
deliberate
and
loud
voice
pierre
looked
silently
and
inquiringly
him
over
his
spectacles
have
heard

continued
the
stranger
and
your
misfortune
seemed
emphasize
the
last
word
say

please
know
that
what
happened

was
misfortune
regret
very
much
dear
sir
pierre
flushed
and
hurriedly
putting
his
legs
down
from
the
bed
bent
forward
toward
the
old
man
with
forced
and
timid
smile
have
not
referred
this
out
curiosity
dear
sir
but
for
greater
reasons
paused
his
gaze
still
pierre
and
moved
aside
the
sofa
way
inviting
the
other
take
seat
beside
him
pierre
felt
reluctant
enter
into
conversation
with
this
old
man
but
submitting
him
involuntarily
came
and
sat
down
beside
him
you
are
unhappy
dear
sir
the
stranger
continued
you
are
young
and
old
should
like
help
you
far
lies
power
yes
said
pierre
with
forced
smile
very
grateful
you
where
are
you
traveling
from
the
stranger
face
was
not
genial
was
even
cold
and
severe
but
spite
this
both
the
face
and
words
his
new
acquaintance
were
irresistibly
attractive
pierre
but
for
reason
you
don
feel
inclined
talk
said
the
old
man
say
dear
sir
and
suddenly
smiled
unexpected
and
tenderly
paternal
way
not
all
the
contrary
very
glad
make
your
acquaintance
said
pierre
and
again
glancing
the
stranger
hands
looked
more
closely
the
ring
with
its
skull
masonic
sign
allow
ask
said
are
you
mason
yes
belong
the
brotherhood
the
freemasons
said
the
stranger
looking
deeper
and
deeper
into
pierre
eyes
and
their
name
and
own
hold
out
brotherly
hand
you
afraid
said
pierre
smiling
and
wavering
between
the
confidence
the
personality
the
freemason
inspired
him
and
his
own
habit
ridiculing
the
masonic
beliefs
afraid
very
far
from
understanding
how
put
afraid
way
looking
the
world
opposed
yours
that
shall
not
understand
one
another
know
your
outlook
said
the
mason
and
the
view
life
you
mention
and
which
you
think
the
result
your
own
mental
efforts
the
one
held
the
majority
people
and
the
invariable
fruit
pride
indolence
and
ignorance
forgive
dear
sir
but
had
not
known
should
not
have
addressed
you
your
view
life
regrettable
delusion
just
may
suppose
you
deluded
said
pierre
with
faint
smile
should
never
dare
say
that
know
the
truth
said
the
mason
whose
words
struck
pierre
more
and
more
their
precision
and
firmness
one
can
attain
truth
himself
only
laying
stone
stone
with
the
cooperation
all
the
millions
generations
from
our
forefather
adam
our
own
times
that
temple
reared
which
worthy
dwelling
place
the
great
god
added
and
closed
his
eyes
ought
tell
you
that
not
believe
not
believe
god
said
pierre
regretfully
and
with
effort
feeling
essential
speak
the
whole
truth
the
mason
looked
intently
pierre
and
smiled
rich
man
with
millions
hand
might
smile
poor
fellow
who
told
him
that
poor
man
had
not
the
five
rubles
that
would
make
him
happy
yes
you
not
know
him
dear
sir
said
the
mason
you
cannot
know
him
you
not
know
him
and
that
why
you
are
unhappy
yes
yes
unhappy
assented
pierre
but
what
you
know
him
not
dear
sir
and
you
are
very
unhappy
you
not
know
him
but
here
words
thee
and
even
those
blasphemous
words
thou
hast
just
uttered
pronounced
the
mason
stern
and
tremulous
voice
paused
and
sighed
evidently
trying
calm
himself
were
not
said
quietly
you
and
would
not
speaking
him
dear
sir
what
whom
are
speaking
whom
hast
thou
denied
suddenly
asked
with
exulting
austerity
and
authority
his
voice
who
invented
him
did
not
exist
whence
came
thy
conception
the
existence
such
incomprehensible
being
didst
thou
and
why
did
the
whole
world
conceive
the
idea
the
existence
such
incomprehensible
being
being
all
powerful
eternal
and
infinite
all
his
attributes
stopped
and
remained
silent
for
long
time
pierre
could
not
and
did
not
wish
break
this
silence
exists
but
understand
him
hard
the
mason
began
again
looking
not
pierre
but
straight
before
him
and
turning
the
leaves
his
book
with
his
old
hands
which
from
excitement
could
not
keep
still
were
man
whose
existence
thou
didst
doubt
could
bring
him
thee
could
take
him
the
hand
and
show
him
thee
but
how
can
insignificant
mortal
show
his
omnipotence
his
infinity
and
all
his
mercy
one
who
blind
who
shuts
his
eyes
that
may
not
see
understand
him
and
may
not
see
understand
his
own
vileness
and
sinfulness
paused
again
who
art
thou
thou
dreamest
that
thou
art
wise
because
thou
couldst
utter
those
blasphemous
words
went
with
somber
and
scornful
smile
and
thou
art
more
foolish
and
unreasonable
than
little
child
who
playing
with
the
parts
skillfully
made
watch
dares
say
that
does
not
understand
its
use
does
not
believe
the
master
who
made
know
him
hard
for
ages
from
our
forefather
adam
our
own
day
labor
attain
that
knowledge
and
are
still
infinitely
far
from
our
aim
but
our
lack
understanding
see
only
our
weakness
and
his
greatness
pierre
listened
with
swelling
heart
gazing
into
the
mason
face
with
shining
eyes
not
interrupting
questioning
him
but
believing
with
his
whole
soul
what
the
stranger
said
whether
accepted
the
wise
reasoning
contained
the
mason
words
believed
child
believes
the
speaker
tone
conviction
and
earnestness
the
tremor
the
speaker
voice
which
sometimes
almost
broke
those
brilliant
aged
eyes
grown
old
this
conviction
the
calm
firmness
and
certainty
his
vocation
which
radiated
from
his
whole
being
and
which
struck
pierre
especially
contrast
with
his
own
dejection
and
hopelessness
any
rate
pierre
longed
with
his
whole
soul
believe
and
did
believe
and
felt
joyful
sense
comfort
regeneration
and
return
life
not
apprehended

but

the
mason
not

said
pierre
feeling
with
dismay
doubts
reawakening
was
afraid
any
want
clearness
any
weakness
the
mason
arguments
dreaded
not
able
believe
him

said
how
that
the
mind
man
cannot
attain
the
knowledge
which
you
speak
the
mason
smiled
with
his
gentle
fatherly
smile
the
highest
wisdom
and
truth
are
like

purest

wish

retain
some
degree

yes

said
pierre
joyfully
the
highest
wisdom
not
founded
reason

not
those
worldly
sciences
physics
history
chemistry
and
the
like
into
which
intellectual
knowledge

yes
assented
pierre
look
then
thy
inner
self
with
the
eyes
the
spirit
and
ask
thyself
whether
thou
art
content
with

what

thou
attained

content
with

and
with
your

pierre
muttered
wincing
thou
hatest
then
change
purify
thyself
and
thou
art
purified
thou
wilt
gain
wisdom
look
your
life
dear
sir
how
have
you
spent
riotous
orgies
and
debauchery
receiving
everything
from
society
and
giving
nothing

you
have
become
the
possessor
wealth
how
have
you
used
what
have
you
done
for
your

and
morally

that

misery
man
offended
you
and
you
shot
him
and
you
say
you
not
know
god
and
hate
your
life
there
nothing
strange
that
dear
sir
after
these
words
the
mason
tired
his
long
discourse
again
leaned
his
arms
the
back
the
sofa
and
closed
his
eyes
pierre
looked
that
aged
stern
motionless
almost
lifeless
face
and
moved
his
lips
without
uttering
sound
wished
say
yes
vile
idle
vicious
life
but
dared
not
break
the
silence
the
mason
cleared
his
throat
huskily
old
men
and
called
his
servant
how
about
the
horses
asked
without
looking
pierre
the
exchange
horses
have
just
come
answered
the
servant
will
you
not
rest
here
tell
them
harness
can
really
going
away
leaving
alone
without
having
told
all
and
without
promising
help
thought
pierre
rising
with
downcast
head
and
began
pace
the
room
glancing
occasionally
the
mason
yes
never
thought
but
have
led
contemptible
and
profligate
life
though
did
not
like
and
did
not
want
thought
pierre
but
this
man
knows
the
truth
and
wished
could
disclose
pierre
wished
say
this
the
mason
but
did
not
dare
the
traveler
having
packed
his
things
with
his
practiced
hands
began
fastening
his
coat
when
had
finished
turned
bezukhov
and
said
tone
indifferent
politeness
where
are
you
going
now
dear
sir
going
petersburg
answered
pierre
childlike
hesitating
voice
thank

all
you
have
said
but
not
suppose
bad
with
whole
soul
wish
what
you
would
have

never
had

from
anyone
but
above
all
who

everything

and
perhaps
may
pierre
could
not
gulped
and
turned
away
the
mason
remained
silent
for
long
time
evidently
considering

comes
from
god
alone
said

such
measure

can
bestow

novikov
time
for
long
while
after
had
gone
pierre
did
not
bed
order
horses
but
paced
and
down
the
room
pondering
over
his
vicious
past
and
with
rapturous
sense
beginning
anew
pictured
himself
the
blissful
irreproachable
virtuous
future
that
seemed
him
easy
seemed
him
that
had
been
vicious
only
because
had
somehow
forgotten
how
good

the
young
polish

into

evening
the
official
and
ceremonious

willarski
carriage
your

willarski
was
silent
throughout
the
drive
pierre
inquiries
what
must
and
how
should
answer
willarski
only
replied
that
brothers
more
worthy
than
would
test
him
and
that
pierre
had
only
tell
the
truth
having
entered
the
courtyard
large
house
where
the
lodge
had
its
headquarters
and
having
ascended
dark
staircase
they
entered
small
well
lit
anteroom
where
they
took
off
their
cloaks
without
the
aid
servant
from
there
they
passed
into
another
room
man
strange
attire
appeared
the
door
willarski
stepping
toward
him
said
something
him
french
undertone
and
then
went
small
wardrobe
which
pierre
noticed
garments
such
had
never
seen
before
having
taken
kerchief
from
the
cupboard
willarski
bound
pierre
eyes
with
and
tied
knot
behind
catching
some
hairs
painfully
the
knot
then
drew
his
face
down
kissed
him
and
taking
him
the
hand
led
him
forward
the
hairs
tied
the
knot
hurt
pierre
and
there
were
lines
pain
his
face
and
shamefaced
smile
his
huge
figure
with
arms
hanging
down
and
with
puckered
though
smiling
face
moved
after
willarski
with
uncertain
timid
steps
having
led
him
about
ten
paces
willarski
stopped
whatever
happens
you
said
you
must
bear
all
manfully
you
have
firmly
resolved
join
our
brotherhood
pierre
nodded
affirmatively
when
you
hear
knock
the
door
you
will
uncover
your
eyes
added
willarski
wish
you
courage
and
success
and
pressing
pierre
hand
went
out
left
alone
pierre
went
smiling
the
same
way
once
twice
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
raised
his
hand
the
kerchief
wishing
take
off
but
let
drop
again
the
five
minutes
spent
with
his
eyes
bandaged
seemed
him
hour
his
arms
felt
numb
his
legs
almost
gave
way
seemed
him
that
was
tired
out
experienced
variety
most
complex
sensations
felt
afraid
what
would
happen
him
and
still
more
afraid
showing
his
fear
felt
curious
know
what
was
going
happen
and
what
would
revealed
him
but
most
all
felt
joyful
that
the
moment
had
come
when
would
last
start
that
path
regeneration
and
the
actively
virtuous
life
which
had
been
dreaming
since
met
joseph
alexeevich
loud
knocks
were
heard
the
door
pierre
took
the
bandage
off
his
eyes
and
glanced
around
him
the
room
was
black
darkness
only
small
lamp
was
burning
inside
something
white
pierre
went
nearer
and
saw
that
the
lamp
stood
black
table
which
lay
open
book
the
book
was
the
gospel
and
the
white
thing
with
the
lamp
inside
was
human
skull
with
its
cavities
and
teeth
after
reading
the
first
words
the
gospel
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
pierre
went
round
the
table
and
saw
large
open
box
filled
with
something
was
coffin
with
bones
inside
was
not
all
surprised
what
saw
hoping
enter
entirely
new
life
quite
unlike
the
old
one
expected
everything
unusual
even
more
unusual
than
what
was
seeing
skull
coffin
the
gospel
seemed
him
that
had
expected
all
this
and
even
more
trying
stimulate
his
emotions
looked
around
god
death
love
the
brotherhood
man
kept
saying
himself
associating
these
words
with
vague
yet
joyful
ideas
the
door
opened
and
someone
came
the
dim
light
which
pierre
had
already
become
accustomed
saw
rather
short
man
having
evidently
come
from
the
light
into
the
darkness
the
man
paused
then
moved
with
cautious
steps
toward
the
table
and
placed
his
small
leather
gloved
hands
this
short
man
had
white
leather
apron
which
covered
his
chest
and
part
his
legs
had
kind
necklace
above
which
rose
high
white
ruffle
outlining
his
rather
long
face
which
was
lit
from
below
for
what
have
you
come
hither
asked
the
newcomer
turning
pierre
direction
slight
rustle
made
the
latter
why
have
you
who
not
believe
the
truth
the
light
and
who
have
not
seen
the
light
come
here
what
you
seek
from
wisdom
virtue
enlightenment
the
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
stranger
came
pierre
felt
sense
awe
and
veneration
such
had
experienced
his
boyhood
confession
felt
himself
the
presence
one
socially
complete
stranger
yet
nearer
him
through
the
brotherhood
man
with
bated
breath
and
beating
heart
moved
toward
the
rhetor
which
name
the
brother
who
prepared
seeker
for
entrance
into
the
brotherhood
was
known
drawing
nearer
recognized
the
rhetor
man
knew
smolyaninov
and
mortified
him
think
that
the
newcomer
was
acquaintance
wished
him
simply
brother
and
virtuous
instructor
for
long
time
could
not
utter
word
that
the
rhetor
had
repeat
his
question
yes
desire
regeneration
pierre
uttered
with
difficulty
very
well
said
smolyaninov
and
went
once
have
you
any
idea
the
means
which
our
holy
order
will
help
you
reach
your
aim
said
quietly
and
quickly
hope
for
guidance
help
regeneration
said
pierre
with
trembling
voice
and
some
difficulty
utterance
due
his
excitement
and
being
unaccustomed
speak
abstract
matters
russian
what
your
conception
freemasonry
imagine
that
freemasonry
the
fraternity
and
equality
men
who
have
virtuous
aims
said
pierre
feeling
ashamed
the
inadequacy
his
words
for
the
solemnity
the
moment
spoke
imagine
good
said
the
rhetor
quickly
apparently
satisfied
with
this
answer
have
you
sought
for
means
attaining
your
aim
religion
considered
erroneous
and
did
not
follow
said
pierre
softly
that
the
rhetor
did
not
hear
him
and
asked
him
what
was
saying
have
been
atheist
answered
pierre
you
are
seeking
for
truth
order
follow
its
laws
your
life
therefore
you
seek
wisdom
and
virtue
that
not
said
the
rhetor
after
moment
pause
yes
yes
assented
pierre
the
rhetor
cleared
his
throat
crossed
his
gloved
hands
his
breast
and
began
speak
now
must
disclose
you
the
chief
aim
our
order
said
and
this
aim
coincides
with
yours
you
may
enter
our
brotherhood
with
profit
the
first
and
chief
object
our
order
the
foundation
which
rests
and
which
human
power
can
destroy
the
preservation
and
handing
posterity
certain
important
mystery
which
has
come
down
from
the
remotest
ages
even
from
the
first
man
mystery
which
perhaps
the
fate
mankind
depends
but
since
this
mystery
such
nature
that
nobody
can
know
use
unless
prepared
long
and
diligent
self
purification
not
everyone
can
hope
attain
quickly
hence
have
secondary
aim
that
preparing
our
members
much
possible
reform
their
hearts
purify
and
enlighten
their
minds
means
handed
tradition
from
those
who
have
striven
attain
this
mystery
and
thereby
render
them
capable
receiving
purifying
and
regenerating
our
members
try
thirdly
improve
the
whole
human
race
offering
our
members
example
piety
and
virtue
and
thereby
try
with
all
our
might
combat
the
evil
which
sways
the
world
think
this
over
and
will
come
you
again
combat
the
evil
which
sways
the
world
pierre
repeated
and
mental
image
his
future
activity
this
direction
rose
his
mind
imagined
men
such
had
himself
been
fortnight
ago
and
addressed
edifying
exhortation
them
imagined
himself
vicious
and
unfortunate
people
whom
would
assist
word
and
deed
imagined
oppressors
whose
victims
would
rescue
the
three
objects
mentioned
the
rhetor
this
last
that
improving
mankind
especially
appealed
pierre
the
important
mystery
mentioned
the
rhetor
though
aroused
his
curiosity
did
not
seem
him
essential
and
the
second
aim
that
purifying
and
regenerating
himself
did
not
much
interest
him
because
that
moment
felt
with
delight
that
was
already
perfectly
cured
his
former
faults
and
was
ready
for
all
that
was
good
half
hour
later
the
rhetor
returned
inform
the
seeker
the
seven
virtues
corresponding
the
seven
steps
solomon
temple
which
every
freemason
should
cultivate
himself
these
virtues
were
discretion
the
keeping
the
secrets
the
order
obedience
those
higher
ranks
the
order
morality
love
mankind
courage
generosity
the
love
death
the
seventh
place
try
the
frequent
thought
death
the
rhetor
said
bring
yourself
regard
not
dreaded
foe
but
friend
that
frees
the
soul
grown
weary
the
labors
virtue
from
this
distressful
life
and
leads
its
place
recompense
and
peace
yes
that
must
thought
pierre
when
after
these
words
the
rhetor
went
away
leaving
him
solitary
meditation
must
but
still
weak
that
love
life
the
meaning
which
only
now
gradually
opening
before
but
five
the
other
virtues
which
pierre
recalled
counting
them
his
fingers
felt
already
his
soul
courage
generosity
morality
love
mankind
and
especially
obedience
which
did
not
even
seem
him
virtue
but
joy
now
felt
glad
free
from
his
own
lawlessness
and
submit
his
will
those
who
knew
the
indubitable
truth
forgot
what
the
seventh
virtue
was
and
could
not
recall
the
third
time
the
rhetor
came
back
more
quickly
and
asked
pierre
whether
was
still
firm
his
intention
and
determined
submit
all
that
would
required
him
ready
for
everything
said
pierre
must
also
inform
you
said
the
rhetor
that
our
order
delivers
its
teaching
not
words
only
but
also
other
means
which
may
perhaps
have
stronger
effect
the
sincere
seeker
after
wisdom
and
virtue
than
mere
words
this
chamber
with
what
you
see
therein
should
already
have
suggested
your
heart
sincere
more
than
words
could
you
will
perhaps
also
see
your
further
initiation
like
method
enlightenment
our
order
imitates
the
ancient
societies
that
explained
their
teaching
hieroglyphics
hieroglyph
said
the
rhetor
emblem
something
not
cognizable
the
senses
but
which
possesses
qualities
resembling
those
the
symbol
pierre
knew
very
well
what
hieroglyph
was
but
dared
not
speak
listened
the
rhetor
silence
feeling
from
all
said
that
his
ordeal
was
about
begin
you
are
resolved
must
begin
your
initiation
said
the
rhetor
coming
closer
pierre
token
generosity
ask
you
give
all
your
valuables
but
have
nothing
here
replied
pierre
supposing
that
was
asked
give
all
possessed
what
you
have
with
you
watch
money
rings
pierre
quickly
took
out
his
purse
and
watch
but
could
not
manage
for
some
time
get
the
wedding
ring
off
his
fat
finger
when
that
had
been
done
the
rhetor
said
token
obedience
ask
you
undress
pierre
took
off
his
coat
waistcoat
and
left
boot
according
the
rhetor
instructions
the
mason
drew
the
shirt
back
from
pierre
left
breast
and
stooping
down
pulled
the
left
leg
his
trousers
above
the
knee
pierre
hurriedly
began
taking
off
his
right
boot
also
and
was
going
tuck
the
other
trouser
leg
save
this
stranger
the
trouble
but
the
mason
told
him
that
was
not
necessary
and
gave
him
slipper
for
his
left
foot
with
childlike
smile
embarrassment
doubt
and
self
derision
which
appeared
his
face
against
his
will
pierre
stood
with
his
arms
hanging
down
and
legs
apart
before
his
brother
rhetor
and
awaited
his
further
commands
and
now
token
candor
ask
you
reveal
your
chief
passion
said
the
latter
passion
have
had
many
replied
pierre
that
passion
which
more
than
all
others
caused
you
waver
the
path
virtue
said
the
mason
pierre
paused
seeking
reply
wine
gluttony
idleness
laziness
irritability
anger
women
went
over
his
vices
his
mind
not
knowing
which
them
give
the
pre
eminence
women
said
low
scarcely
audible
voice
the
mason
did
not
move
and
for
long
time
said
nothing
after
this
answer
last
moved
pierre
and
taking
the
kerchief
that
lay
the
table
again
bound
his
eyes
for
the
last
time
say
you
turn
all
your
attention
upon
yourself
put
bridle
your
senses
and
seek
blessedness
not
passion
but
your
own
heart
the
source
blessedness
not
without
but
within
pierre
had
already
long
been
feeling
himself
that
refreshing
source
blessedness
which
now
flooded
his
heart
with
glad
emotion
chapter
soon
after
this
there
came
into
the
dark
chamber
fetch
pierre
not
the
rhetor
but
pierre
sponsor
willarski
whom
recognized
his
voice
fresh
questions
the
firmness
his
resolution
pierre
replied
yes
yes
agree
and
with
beaming
childlike
smile
his
fat
chest
uncovered
stepping
unevenly
and
timidly
one
slippered
and
one
booted
foot
advanced
while
willarski
held
sword
his
bare
chest
was
conducted
from
that
room
along
passages
that
turned
backwards
and
forwards
and
was
last
brought
the
doors
the
lodge
willarski
coughed
was
answered
the
masonic
knock
with
mallets
the
doors
opened
before
them
bass
voice
pierre
was
still
blindfolded
questioned
him
who
was
when
and
where
was
born
and
then
was
again
led
somewhere
still
blindfolded
and
they
went
along
was
told
allegories
the
toils
his
pilgrimage
holy
friendship
the
eternal
architect
the
universe
and
the
courage
with
which
should
endure
toils
and
dangers
during
these
wanderings
pierre
noticed
that
was
spoken
now
the
seeker
now
the
sufferer
and
now
the
postulant
the
accompaniment
various
knockings
with
mallets
and
swords
was
being
led
some
object
noticed
hesitation
and
uncertainty
among
his
conductors
heard
those
around
him
disputing
whispers
and
one
them
insisting
that
should
led
along
certain
carpet
after
that
they
took
his
right
hand
placed
something
and
told
him
hold
pair
compasses
his
left
breast
with
the
other
hand
and
repeat
after
someone
who
read
aloud
oath
fidelity
the
laws
the
order
the
candles
were
then
extinguished
and
some
spirit
lighted
pierre
knew
the
smell
and
was
told
that
would
now
see
the
lesser
light
the
bandage
was
taken
off
his
eyes
and
the
faint
light
the
burning
spirit
pierre
dream
saw
several
men
standing
before
him
wearing
aprons
like
the
rhetor
and
holding
swords
their
hands
pointed
his
breast
among
them
stood
man
whose
white
shirt
was
stained
with
blood
seeing
this
pierre
moved
forward
with
his
breast
toward
the
swords
meaning
them
pierce
but
the
swords
were
drawn
back
from
him
and
was
once
blindfolded
again
now
thou
hast
seen
the
lesser
light
uttered
voice
then
the
candles
were
relit
and
was
told
that
would
see
the
full
light
the
bandage
was
again
removed
and
more
than
ten
voices
said
together
sic
transit
gloria
mundi
pierre
gradually
began
recover
himself
and
looked
about
the
room
and
the
people
round
long
table
covered
with
black
sat
some
twelve
men
garments
like
those
had
already
seen
some
them

had
met

with
peculiar
cross
hanging
from
his
neck

all
maintained
solemn
silence
listening
the
words
the
president
who
held
mallet
his
hand
let
into
the
wall
was
star
shaped
light
one
side
the
table
was
small
carpet
with
various
figures
worked
upon
the
other
was
something
resembling
altar
which
lay
testament
and
skull
round
stood
seven
large
candlesticks
like
those
used
churches
two
the
brothers
led
pierre

his
feet

angles
and
bade
him
lie
down
saying
that

prostrate
himself

first
receive
the
trowel
whispered
one
the
brothers
hush
please
said
another
pierre
perplexed
looked
round
with
his
shortsighted
eyes
without
obeying
and
suddenly
doubts
arose
his
mind
where
what
doing
aren
they
laughing
shan
ashamed
remember
this
but
these
doubts
only
lasted
moment
pierre
glanced
the
serious
faces
those
around
remembered
all
had
already
gone
through
and
realized
that
could
not
stop
halfway
was
aghast
his
hesitation
and
trying
arouse
his
former
devotional
feeling
prostrated
himself
before
the
gates
the
temple
and
really
the
feeling
devotion
returned
him
even
more
strongly
than
before
when
had
lain
there
some
time
was
told

white
leather

the
others
wore
was
put

then
the
grand
master
addressed
him
told
him
that
should
try
nothing

the
whiteness
that
apron
which
symbolized
strength
and
purity
then
the
unexplained
trowel
told
him

his
own
heart
from
vice
and
indulgently
smooth
with
the
heart
his
neighbor

that

their
meaning
but
must

pause
added
but

while
the
grand
master
said
these
last
words
seemed
pierre
that
grew
embarrassed
pierre
himself
grew
still
more
confused
blushed
like
child
till
tears
came
his
eyes
began
looking
about
him
uneasily
and
awkward
pause
followed
this
silence
was
broken
one

and
getting
embraced
and
kissed
pierre
who
with
tears
joy
his
eyes
looked
round
him
not
knowing
how
answer
the
congratulations
and
greetings
from
acquaintances
that
met

but
saw
all

round

fearing
that

look
like
pride
subscribed
the
same
amount
the
others
the
meeting
was

and
reaching
home
pierre
felt
had
returned
from

had
spent
dozens

become
completely
changed
and
had
quite
left
behind

the
day
after

been
received
into
the
lodge

sitting
home
reading

and
trying
fathom
the
significance
the
square
one
side
which
symbolized
god
another
moral
things
third
physical
things
and
the
fourth
combination
these
now
and
then
his
attention
wandered
from
the

and
the
square

formed
imagination

the
previous

the

been
regarded
with
patronizing
condescension

which
with
characteristic
tact
she
had
acquired
though
she
did
not
understand
its

this

suggested
that

uncomplainingly

that
her

according

what

prince
andrew
and

admitted
one

that
the

reminded
them
strangely

what
was
still
stranger
though

partly
because

still
standing

just
when

always
poking

well
let
him
and
began
reading
bilibin
letter
which
was
written
french
read
without
understanding
half
read
only
forget
but
for
moment
what
had
too
long
been
thinking
painfully
the
exclusion
all
else
chapter
bilibin
was
now
army

diplomatic
capacity
and
though
wrote
french
and
used
french
jests
and
french
idioms
described
the
whole
campaign
with
fearless
self
censure
and
self
derision
genuinely
russian
bilibin
wrote
that
the
obligation
diplomatic
discretion
tormented
him
and
was
happy
have
prince
andrew
reliable

could
pour
out
the
bile
had
accumulated
the

all
that
was
being
done

the
letter
was
old
having
been
written
before
the
battle
preussisch
eylau
since
the
day
our
brilliant
success
austerlitz
wrote
bilibin
you
know
dear
prince
never

have
certainly
acquired
taste
for
war
and
just
well
for
what
have
seen
during
these
last
three
months
incredible
begin

the

who
have
only
betrayed
three
times
three
years

their
cause
but
turns
out
that
the
enemy
the
human
race
pays
heed
our
fine
speeches
and
his
rude
and
savage
way
throws
himself
the
prussians
without
giving

the

they
had
begun

two

for
the

have
everything
perfect
order
only
one
little
thing
lacking
namely
commander
chief
was
considered
that
the
austerlitz
success
might
have
been
more
decisive
had
the
commander
chief
not
been
young
all
our
octogenarians
were
reviewed
and
prozorovski
and
kamenski
the
latter
was
preferred
the
general
comes
suvorov
like
kibitka
and
received
with
acclamations
joy
and
triumph
the
the

arrives
from

looks
and
waits
for
letters
addressed

but
none
are
found
the
field
marshal
grows
impatient
and
sets
work
himself
and
finds
letters
from
the
emperor
count
prince
and
others
then
bursts
into
one
his
wild
furies
and
rages
everyone
and
everything
seizes
the

opens
them
and
reads
those
from

this
the

those
that

are
naturally
increasingly

after

that

bennigsen
does
not
quite
see
more
particularly
and
his
corps
who
are
within

and
wishes
profit
the
opportunity

his

the
germans
say
does
this
the
battle
pultusk
which
considered
great
victory
but
opinion
was
nothing
the
kind
civilians
you
know
have
very
bad
way
deciding
whether

was
won
lost
those
who
retreat
after

lost

and
according
that
who

maneuvers
our

should
avoid

but
solely
avoid
general
buxhowden
who

should
our

energetically
pursue
this
aim
that
after
crossing
unfordable
river
burn
the

separate

from

and
the

and
epileptic
fit
bennigsen
but
the
critical
moment
the
courier
who
carried
the
news
our
victory
pultusk
petersburg
returns
bringing
our
appointment
commander
chief
and
our
first
foe
buxhowden
vanquished
can
now
turn
our
thoughts
the
second
bonaparte
but
turns
out
just
that
moment
third
enemy
rises
before
namely
the
orthodox
russian
soldiers
loudly
demanding
bread
meat
biscuits
fodder
and
whatnot
the
stores
are
empty
the
roads
impassable
the
orthodox
begin
looting
and
way
which
our
last
campaign
can
give
you
idea
half
the
regiments
form
bands
and
scour
the
countryside
and
put
everything
fire
and
sword
the
inhabitants
are
totally
ruined
the
hospitals
overflow
with
sick
and
famine
everywhere
twice
the
marauders
even
attack
our
headquarters
and
the
commander
chief
has
ask
for
battalion
disperse
them
during
one
these
attacks
they
carried
off
empty
portmanteau
and
dressing
gown
the
emperor
proposes
give
all
commanders
divisions
the
right
shoot
marauders
but
much
fear
this
will
oblige
one
half
the
army
shoot
the
other
first
prince
andrew
read
with
his
eyes
only
but
after
while
spite
himself
although
knew
how
far
was
safe
trust
bilibin
what
had
read
began
interest
him
more
and
more
when
had
read
thus
far
crumpled
the
letter
and
threw
away
was
not
what
had
read
that
vexed
him
but
the
fact
that
the
life
out
there
which
had
now
part
could
perturb
him
shut
his
eyes
rubbed
his
forehead
rid
himself
all
interest
what
had
read
and
listened
what
was
passing
the
nursery
suddenly
thought
heard
strange
noise
through
the
door
was
seized
with
alarm
lest
something
should
have
happened
the
child
while
was
reading
the
letter
went
tiptoe
the
nursery
door
and
opened
just
went
saw
that
the
nurse
was
hiding
something
from
him
with
scared
look
and
that
princess
mary
was
longer
the
cot
dear
heard
what
seemed
him
her
despairing
whisper
behind
him
often
happens
after
long
sleeplessness
and
long
anxiety
was
seized
unreasoning
panic
occurred
him
that
the
child
was
dead
all
that
saw
and
heard
seemed
confirm
this
terror
all
over
thought
and
cold
sweat
broke
out
his
forehead
went
the
cot
confusion
sure
that
would
find
empty
and
that
the
nurse
had
been
hiding
the
dead
baby
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
for
some
time
his
frightened
restless
eyes
could
not
find
the
baby
last
saw
him
the
rosy
boy
had
tossed
about
till
lay
across
the
bed
with
his
head
lower
than
the
pillow
and
was
smacking
his
lips
his
sleep
and
breathing
evenly
prince
andrew
was
glad
find
the
boy
like
that
had
already
lost
him
bent
over
him
and
his
sister
had
taught
him
tried
with
his
lips
whether
the
child
was
still
feverish
the
soft
forehead
was
moist
prince
andrew
touched
the
head
with
his
hand
even
the
hair
was
wet
profusely
had
the
child
perspired
was
not
dead
but
evidently
the
crisis
was
over
and
was
convalescent
prince
andrew
longed
snatch
squeeze
hold
his
heart
this
helpless
little
creature
but
dared
not
stood
over
him
gazing
his
head
and
the
little
arms
and
legs
which
showed
under
the
blanket
heard
rustle
behind
him
and
shadow
appeared
under
the
curtain
the
cot
did
not
look
round
but
still
gazing
the
infant
face
listened
his
regular
breathing
the
dark
shadow
was
princess
mary
who
had
come
the
cot
with
noiseless
steps
lifted
the
curtain
and
dropped
again
behind
her
prince
andrew
recognized
her
without
looking
and
held
out
his
hand
her
she
pressed
has
perspired
said
prince
andrew
was
coming
tell
you
the
child
moved
slightly
his
sleep
smiled
and
rubbed
his
forehead
against
the
pillow
prince
andrew
looked
his
sister
the
dim
shadow
the
curtain
her
luminous
eyes
shone
more
brightly
than
usual
from
the
tears
joy
that
were
them
she
leaned
over
her
brother
and
kissed
him
slightly
catching
the
curtain
the
cot
each
made
the
other
warning
gesture
and
stood
still
the
dim
light
beneath
the
curtain
not
wishing
leave
that
seclusion
where
they
three
were
shut
off
from
all
the
world
prince
andrew
was
the
first
move
away
ruffling
his
hair
against
the
muslin
the
curtain

this
the
one
thing
left

with

after

with
alarm

displeased
with

after

the
new
words
they
had
not

simply
enjoyed
hearing
how
the

talked
while
the
cleverest
among
them
including
the
chief
steward
understood
from
this
speech
how
they
could
best
handle
the
master
for
their
own
ends
the

expressed
great
sympathy
with

years
and
did
not
know
how
the
rest
about
rubles
was
spent
and
almost
every
year
was
obliged
borrow
besides
this
the
chief
steward
wrote
every
year
telling
him
fires
and
bad
harvests
the
necessity
rebuilding
factories
and
workshops
the
first
task
pierre
had
face
was
one
for
which
had
very
little
aptitude
inclination
practical
business
discussed
estate
affairs
every
day
with
his
chief
steward
but
felt
that
this
did
not
forward
matters
all
felt
that
these
consultations
were
detached
from
real
affairs
and
did
not
link
with
them
make
them
move
the
one
hand
the
chief
steward
put
the
state
things
him
the
very
worst
light
pointing
out
the
necessity
paying
off
the
debts
and
undertaking
new
activities
with
serf
labor
which
pierre
did
not
agree
the
other
hand
pierre
demanded
that
steps
should
taken
liberate
the
serfs
which
the
steward
met
showing
the
necessity
first
paying
off
the
loans
from
the
land
bank
and
the
consequent
impossibility
speedy
emancipation
the
steward
did
not
say
was
quite
impossible
but
suggested
selling
the
forests
the
province
kostroma
the
land
lower
down
the
river
and
the
crimean
estate
order
make
possible
all
which
operations
according
him
were
connected
with
such
complicated
measures
the
removal
injunctions
petitions
permits
and
that
pierre
became
quite
bewildered
and
only
replied
yes
yes
pierre
had
none
the
practical
persistence
that
would
have
enabled
him
attend
the
business
himself
and
disliked
and
only
tried
pretend
the
steward
that
was
attending
the
steward
for
his
part
tried
pretend
the
count
that
considered
these
consultations
very
valuable
for
the
proprietor
and
troublesome
himself
kiev
pierre
found
some
people
knew
and
strangers
hastened
make
his
acquaintance
and
joyfully
welcomed
the
rich
newcomer
the
largest
landowner
the
province
temptations
pierre
greatest
weakness
the
one
which
had
confessed
when
admitted
the
lodge
were
strong
that
could
not
resist
them
again
whole
days
weeks
and
months
his
life
passed
great
rush
and
were
much
occupied
with
evening
parties
dinners
lunches
and
balls
giving
him
time
for
reflection
petersburg
instead
the
new
life
had
hoped
lead
still
lived
the
old
life
only
new
surroundings
the
three
precepts
freemasonry
pierre
realized
that
did
not
fulfill
the
one
which
enjoined
every
mason
set
example
moral
life
and
that
the
seven
virtues
lacked
two
morality
and
the
love
death
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
fulfilled
another
the
precepts
that
reforming
the
human
race
and
had
other
virtues
love
his
neighbor
and
especially
generosity
the
spring
decided
return
petersburg
the
way
intended
visit
all
his
estates
and
see
for
himself
how
far
his
orders
had
been
carried
out
and
what
state
were
the
serfs
whom
god
had
entrusted
his
care
and
whom
intended
benefit
the
chief
steward
who
considered
the
young
count
attempts
almost
insane
unprofitable
himself
the
count
and
the
serfs
made
some
concessions
continuing
represent
the
liberation
the
serfs
impracticable
arranged
for
the
erection
large
buildings
schools
hospitals
and
asylums
all
the
estates
before
the
master
arrived
everywhere
preparations
were
made
not
for
ceremonious
welcomes
which
knew
pierre
would
not
like
but
for
just
such
gratefully
religious
ones
with
offerings
icons
and
the
bread
and
salt
hospitality
according
his
understanding
his
master
would
touch
and
delude
him
the
southern
spring
the
comfortable
rapid
traveling
vienna
carriage
and
the
solitude
the
road
all
had
gladdening
effect
pierre
the
estates
had
not
before
visited
were
each
more
picturesque
than
the
other
the
serfs
everywhere
seemed
thriving
and
touchingly
grateful
for
the
benefits
conferred
them
everywhere
were
receptions
which
though
they
embarrassed
pierre
awakened
joyful
feeling
the
depth

heart

were

the

had
been
diminished
and
heard
the
touching

their
full
skirted

what
pierre
did
not
know
was
that
the

that
the

before
but
that
nine

the

did
not

that
since
the
nursing

were

they
did
still
harder
work
their

did
not

met
him
with

the

wept
having

not

increased

lessened
paper
did
not
know
that
where
the
steward
had
shown
him
the
accounts
that
the
serfs
payments
had
been
diminished
third
their
obligatory
manorial
work
had
been
increased
half
and
pierre
was
delighted
with
his
visit
his
estates
and
quite
recovered
the
philanthropic
mood
which
had
left
petersburg
and
wrote
enthusiastic
letters
his
brother
instructor
called
the
grand
master
how
easy
how
little
effort
needs
much
good
thought
pierre
and
how
little
attention
pay
was
pleased
the
gratitude
received
but
felt
abashed
receiving
this
gratitude
reminded
him
how
much
more
might
for
these
simple
kindly
people
the
chief
steward
very
stupid
but
cunning
man
who
saw
perfectly
through
the
naive
and
intelligent
count
and
played
with
him
with
toy
seeing
the
effect
these
prearranged
receptions
had
pierre
pressed
him
still
harder
with
proofs
the
impossibility
and
above
all
the
uselessness
freeing
the
serfs
who
were
quite
happy
was
pierre
his
secret
soul
agreed
with
the
steward
that
would
difficult
imagine
happier
people
and
that
god
only
knew
what
would
happen
them
when
they
were
free
but
insisted
though
reluctantly
what
thought
right
the
steward
promised
all
his
power
carry
out
the
count
wishes
seeing
clearly
that
not
only
would
the
count
never
able
find
out
whether
all
measures
had
been
taken
for
the
sale
the
land
and
forests
and
release
them
from
the
land
bank
but
would
probably
never
even
inquire
and
would
never
know
that
the
newly
erected
buildings
were
standing
empty
and
that
the
serfs
continued
give
money
and
work
all
that
other
people
serfs
gave
that
say
all
that
could

returning

which
were
partly
cut

filled
with

and
with

stretched
along

the

consisted
threshing

and
large

with

still

construction
round
the
house
was

newly
laid

some

met

where
the
prince
lived
pointed
out
small
newly
built
lodge
close
the
pond
anton
man
who
had
looked
after
prince
andrew
his
boyhood
helped
pierre
out
his
carriage
said
that
the
prince
was
home
and
showed
him
into
clean
little
anteroom
pierre
was
struck
the
modesty
the
small
though
clean
house
after
the
brilliant
surroundings
which
had
last
met
his
friend
petersburg
quickly
entered
the
small
reception
room
with
its
still
unplastered
wooden
walls
redolent
pine
and
would
have
gone
farther
but
anton
ran
ahead
tiptoe
and
knocked
door
well
what
came
sharp
unpleasant
voice
visitor
answered
anton
ask
him
wait
and
the
sound
was
heard
chair
being
pushed
back
pierre
went
with
rapid
steps
the
door
and
suddenly
came
face
face
with
prince
andrew
who
came
out
frowning
and
looking
old
pierre
embraced
him
and
lifting
his
spectacles
kissed
his
friend
the
cheek
and
looked
him
closely
well
did
not
expect
you
very
glad
said
prince
andrew
pierre
said
nothing
looked
fixedly
his
friend
with
surprise
was
struck
the
change
him
his
words
were
kindly
and
there
was
smile
his
lips
and
face
but
his
eyes
were
dull
and
lifeless
and
spite
his
evident
wish
could
not
give
them
joyous
and
glad
sparkle
prince
andrew
had
grown
thinner
paler
and
more
manly
looking
but
what
amazed
and
estranged
pierre
till
got
used
were
his
inertia
and
wrinkle
his
brow
indicating
prolonged
concentration
some
one
thought
usually
the
case
with
people
meeting
after
prolonged
separation
was
long
before
their
conversation
could
settle
anything
they
put
questions
and
gave
brief
replies
about
things
they
knew
ought
talked
over
length
last
the
conversation
gradually
settled
some
the
topics
first
lightly
touched
their
past
life
plans
for
the
future
pierre
journeys
and
occupations
the
war
and
the
preoccupation
and
despondency
which
pierre
had
noticed
his
friend
look
was
now
still
more
clearly
expressed
the
smile
with
which
listened
pierre
especially
when
spoke
with
joyful
animation
the
past
the
future
was
prince
andrew
would
have
liked
sympathize
with
what
pierre
was
saying
but
could
not
the
latter
began
feel
that
was
bad
taste
speak
his
enthusiasms
dreams
and
hopes
happiness
goodness
prince
andrew
presence
was
ashamed
express
his
new
masonic
views
which
had
been
particularly
revived
and
strengthened
his
late
tour
checked
himself
fearing
seem
naive
yet
felt
irresistible
desire
show
his
friend
soon
possible
that
was
now
quite
different
and
better
pierre
than
had
been
petersburg
can
tell
you
how
much
have
lived
through
since
then
hardly
know
myself
again
yes
have
altered
much
very
much
since
then
said
prince
andrew
well
and
you
what
are

plans
plans
repeated
prince
andrew
ironically
plans
said
astonished
the
word
well
you
see

altogether
next
year
pierre
looked
silently
and
searchingly
into
prince
andrew
face
which
had
grown
much
older
meant
ask
pierre
began
but
prince
andrew
interrupted
him
but
why
talk
talk
yes
tell
about
your
travels
and
all
you
have
been
doing
your
estates
pierre
began
describing
what
had
done
his
estates
trying
far
possible
conceal
his
own
part
the
improvements
that
had
been
made
prince
andrew
several
times
prompted
pierre
story
what
had
been
doing
though
were
all
old
time
story
and
listened
not
only
without
interest
but
even
ashamed
what
pierre
was
telling
him
pierre
felt
uncomfortable
and
even
depressed
his
friend
company
and
last
became
silent
tell
you
what
dear
fellow
said
prince
andrew
who
evidently
also
felt
depressed
and
constrained
with
his
visitor
only
bivouacking
here
and
have
just
come
look
round
going
back
sister
today
will
introduce
you
her
but

said
evidently
trying
entertain
visitor
with
whom
now
found
nothing
common
will
after
dinner
and
would
you
now
like
look
round
place
they
went
out
and
walked
about
till
dinnertime
talking
the
political
news
and
common
acquaintances
like
people
who
not
know
each
other
intimately
prince
andrew
spoke
with
some
animation
and
interest
only
the
new
homestead
was
constructing
and
its
buildings
but
even
here
while
the
scaffolding
the
midst
talk
explaining
the
future
arrangements
the
house
interrupted
himself
however
this
not
all
interesting
let
have
dinner
and
then
set
off
dinner
conversation
turned
pierre
marriage
was
very
much
surprised
when
heard
said
prince
andrew
pierre
blushed
always
did
when
was
mentioned
and
said
hurriedly
will
tell
you
some
time
how
all
happened
but
you
know
all
over
and
forever
forever
said
prince
andrew
nothing
forever
but
you
know
how
all
ended
don
you
you
heard
the
duel
and
you
had
through
that
too
one
thing
thank
god
for
that
did
not
kill
that
man
said
pierre
why
asked
prince
andrew

very
good
thing

kill
man
bad

why

urged
prince
andrew
not
given
man
know
what
right
and
what
wrong
men
always
did
and
always
will
err
and
nothing
more
than
what
they
consider
right
and
wrong
what
does
harm
another
wrong
said
pierre
feeling
with
pleasure
that
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrival
prince
andrew
was
roused
had
begun
talk
and
wanted
express
what
had
brought
him
his
present
state
and
who
has
told
you
what
bad
for
another
man
asked
bad
bad
exclaimed
pierre
all
know
what
bad
for
ourselves
yes
know
that
but
the
harm
conscious
myself
something
cannot
inflict
others
said
prince
andrew
growing
more
and
more
animated
and
evidently
wishing
express
his
new
outlook
pierre
spoke
french
only
know
two
very
real
evils
life
remorse
and
illness
the
only
good
the
absence
those
evils
live
for
myself
avoiding
those
two
evils
whole
philosophy
now
and
love
one
neighbor
and
self
sacrifice
began
pierre
can
agree
with
you
live
only
not
evil
and
not
have
repent
not
enough
lived
like
that
lived
for
myself
and
ruined
life
and
only
now
when
living
least
trying
pierre
modesty
made
him
correct
himself
live
for
others
only
now
have
understood
all
the
happiness
life
shall
not
agree
with
you
and
you
not
really
believe
what
you
are
saying
prince
andrew
looked
silently
pierre
with
ironic
smile
when
you
see
sister
princess
mary
you
get
with
her
said
perhaps
you
are
right
for
yourself
added
after
short
pause
but
everyone
lives
his
own
way
you
lived
for
yourself
and
say
you
nearly
ruined
your
life
and
only
found
happiness
when
you
began
living
for
others
experienced
just
the
reverse
lived
for
glory
and
after
all
what
glory
the
same
love
others
desire
something
for
them
desire
for
their
approval
lived
for
others
and
not
almost
but
quite
ruined
life
and
have
become
calmer
since
began
live
only
for
myself
but
what
you
mean
living
only
for
yourself
asked
pierre
growing
excited
what
about
your
son
your
sister
and
your
father
but
that
just
the
same
myself
they
are
not
others
explained
prince
andrew
the
others
one
neighbors
prochain
you
and
princess
mary
call
are
the
chief
source
all
error
and
evil
prochain
your
kiev
peasants
whom
you
want
good
and
looked
pierre
with
mocking
challenging
expression
evidently
wished
draw
him
you
are
joking
replied
pierre
growing
more
and
more
excited
what
error
evil
can
there
wishing
good
and
even
doing
little
though
did
very
little
and
did
very
badly
what
evil
can
there
unfortunate
people
our
serfs
people
like
ourselves
were
growing
and
dying
with
idea
god
and
truth
beyond
ceremonies
and
meaningless
prayers
and
are
now
instructed
comforting
belief
future
life
retribution
recompense
and
consolation
what
evil
and
error
are
there
people
were
dying
disease
without
help
while
material
assistance
could
easily
rendered
and
supplied
them
with
doctor
hospital
and
asylum
for
the
aged
and
not
palpable
unquestionable
good
peasant
woman
with
baby
has
rest
day
night
and
give
them
rest
and
leisure
said
pierre
hurrying
and
lisping
and
have
done
that
though
badly
and
small
extent
but
have
done
something
toward
and
you
cannot
persuade
that
was
not
good
action
and
more
than
that
you
can
make
believe
that
you
not
think
yourself
and
the
main
thing
continued
that
know
and
know
for
certain
that
the
enjoyment
doing
this
good
the
only
sure
happiness
life
yes
you

different
matter
said
prince
andrew
build
house
and
lay
out
garden
and
you
build
hospitals
the
one
and
the
other
may
serve
pastime
but
what
right
and
what
good
must
judged
one
who
knows
all
but
not
well
you
want
argument
added
come
then
they
rose
from
the
table
and
sat
down
the
entrance
porch
which
served
veranda
come
let
argue
then

yes
said
frowning
angrily
and
turning
away
from
pierre
prince
andrew
expressed
his
ideas
clearly
and
distinctly
that
was
evident
had
reflected
this
subject
more
than
once
and
spoke
readily
and
rapidly
like
man
who
has
not
talked
for
long
time
his
glance
became
more
animated
his
conclusions
became
more
hopeless
that
dreadful
dreadful
said
pierre
don
understand
how
one
can
live
with
such
ideas
had
such
moments
myself
not
long
ago
moscow
and
when
traveling
but
such
times
collapsed
that
don
live
all
everything
seems
hateful
myself
most
all
then
don
eat
don
wash
and
how
with
you
why
not
wash
that
not
cleanly
said
prince
andrew
the
contrary
one
must
try
make
one
life
pleasant
possible
alive
that
not
fault
must
live
out
life
best
can
without
hurting
others
but
with
such
ideas
what
motive
have
you
for
living
one
would
sit
without
moving
undertaking
nothing
life
leaves
one
peace
should
thankful
nothing
but
here
the
one
hand
the
local
nobility
have
done
the
honor
choose
their
marshal
was
all
could
get
out
they
could
not
understand
that
have
not
the
necessary
qualifications
for
the
kind
good
natured
fussy
shallowness
necessary
for
the
position
then
there
this
house
which
must
built
order
have
nook
one
own
which
quiet
and
now
there
this
recruiting
why
aren
you
serving
the
army
after
austerlitz
said
prince
andrew
gloomily
thank
you
very
much
have
promised
myself
not
serve
again
the
active
russian
army
and
won
not
even
bonaparte
were
here
smolensk
threatening
bald
hills
even
then
wouldn
serve
the
russian
army
well
was
saying
continued
recovering
his
composure
now
there
this
recruiting
father
chief
command
the
third
district
and
only
way
avoiding
active
service
serve
under
him
then
you
are
serving
paused
little
while
and
why
you
serve
why
for
this
reason
father
one
the
most
remarkable
men
his
time
but
growing
old
and
though
not
exactly
cruel
has
too
energetic
character
accustomed
unlimited
power
that
terrible
and
now
has
this
authority
commander
chief
the
recruiting
granted
the
emperor
had
been
two
hours
late
fortnight
ago
would
have
had
paymaster
clerk
yukhnovna
hanged
said
prince
andrew
with
smile
serving
because
alone
have
any
influence
with
father
and
now
and
then
can
save
him
from
actions
which
would
torment
him
afterwards
well
there
you
see
yes
but
not
you
imagine
prince
andrew
continued
did
not
and
not
the
least
care
about
that
scoundrel
clerk
who
had
stolen
some
boots
from
the
recruits
should
even
have
been
very
glad
see
him
hanged
but
was
sorry
for
father
that
again
for
myself
prince
andrew
grew
more
and
more
animated
his
eyes
glittered
feverishly
while
tried
prove
pierre
that
his
actions
there
was
desire
good
his
neighbor
there
now
you
wish
liberate
your
serfs
continued
that
very
good
thing
but
not
for
you
don
suppose
you
ever
had
anyone
flogged
sent
siberia
and
still
less
for
your
serfs
they
are
beaten
flogged
sent
siberia
don
suppose
they
are
any
the
worse
off
siberia
they
lead
the
same
animal
life
and
the
stripes
their
bodies
heal
and
they
are
happy
before
but
good
thing
for
proprietors
who
perish
morally
bring
remorse
upon
themselves
stifle
this
remorse
and
grow
callous
result
being
able
inflict
punishments
justly
and
unjustly
those
people
pity
and
for
their
sake
should
like
liberate
the
serfs
you
may
not
have
seen
but
have
seen
how
good
men
brought
those
traditions
unlimited
power
time
when
they
grow
more
irritable
become
cruel
and
harsh
are
conscious
but
cannot
restrain
themselves
and
grow
more
and
more
miserable
prince
andrew
spoke
earnestly
that
pierre
could
not
help
thinking
that
these
thoughts
had
been
suggested
prince
andrew
his
father
case
did
not
reply
that
what
sorry
for
human
dignity
peace
mind
purity
and
not
the
serfs
backs
and
foreheads
which
beat
and
shave
you
may
always
remain
the
same
backs
and
foreheads
thousand
times
shall
never
agree
with
you
said
pierre
chapter
xii
the
evening
andrew
and
pierre
got
into
the
open
carriage
and
drove
bald
hills
prince
andrew
glancing
pierre
broke
the
silence
now
and
then
with
remarks
which
showed
that
was
good
temper
pointing
the
fields
spoke
the
improvements
was
making
his
husbandry
pierre
remained
gloomily
silent
answering
monosyllables
and
apparently
immersed
his
own
thoughts
was
thinking
that
prince
andrew
was
unhappy
had
gone
astray
did
not
see
the
true
light
and
that
pierre
ought
aid
enlighten
and
raise
him
but
soon
thought
what
should
say
felt
that
prince
andrew
with
one
word
one
argument
would
upset
all
his
teaching
and
shrank
from
beginning
afraid
exposing
possible
ridicule
what
him
was
precious
and
sacred
but
why
you
think
pierre
suddenly
began
lowering
his
head
and
looking
like
bull
about
charge
why
you
think
you
should
not
think
think
what
about
asked
prince
andrew
with
surprise
about
life
about
man
destiny
can
myself
thought
like
that
and
you
know
what
saved
freemasonry
don
smile
freemasonry
not
religious
ceremonial
sect
thought
was
freemasonry
the
best
expression
the
best
the
eternal
aspects
humanity
and
began
explain
freemasonry
understood
prince
andrew
said
that
freemasonry
the
teaching
christianity
freed
from
the
bonds
state
and
church
teaching
equality
brotherhood
and
love
only
our
holy
brotherhood
has
the
real
meaning
life
all
the
rest
dream
said
pierre
understand
dear
fellow
that
outside
this
union
all
filled
with
deceit
and
falsehood
and
agree
with
you
that
nothing
left
for
intelligent
and
good
man
but
live
out
his
life
like
you
merely
trying
not
harm
others
but
make
our
fundamental
convictions
your
own
join
our
brotherhood
give
yourself
let
yourself
guided
and
you
will
once
feel
yourself
have
felt
myself
part
that
vast
invisible
chain
the
beginning
which
hidden
heaven
said
pierre
prince
andrew
looking
straight
front
him
listened
silence
pierre
words
more
than
once
when
the
noise
the
wheels
prevented
his
catching
what
pierre
said
asked
him
repeat
and
the
peculiar
glow
that
came
into
prince
andrew
eyes
and
his
silence
pierre
saw
that
his
words
were
not
vain
and
that
prince
andrew
would
not
interrupt
him
laugh
what
said
they
reached
river
that
had
overflowed
its
banks
and
which
they
had
cross
ferry
while
the
carriage
and
horses
were
being
placed
they
also
stepped
the
raft
prince
andrew
leaning
his
arms
the
raft
railing
gazed
silently
the
flooding
waters
glittering
the
setting
sun
well
what
you
think
about
pierre
asked
why
are
you
silent
what
think
about
listening
you
all
very
well
you
say
join
our
brotherhood
and
will
show
you
the
aim
life
the
destiny
man
and
the
laws
which
govern
the
world
but
who
are
men
how
you
know
everything
why
alone
not
see
what
you
see
you
see
reign
goodness
and
truth
earth
but
don
see
pierre
interrupted
him
you
believe
future
life
asked
future
life
prince
andrew
repeated
but
pierre
giving
him
time
reply
took
the
repetition
for
denial
the
more
readily
knew
prince
andrew
former
atheistic
convictions
you
say
you
can
see
reign
goodness
and
truth
earth
nor
could
and
cannot
seen
one
looks
our
life
here
the
end
everything
earth
here
this
earth
pierre
pointed
the
fields
there
truth
all
false
and
evil
but
the
universe
the
whole
universe
there
kingdom
truth
and
who
are
now
the
children
earth
are
eternally
children
the
whole
universe
don
feel
soul
that
part
this
vast
harmonious
whole
don
feel
that
form
one
link
one
step
between
the
lower
and
higher
beings
this
vast
harmonious
multitude
beings
whom
the
deity
the
supreme
power
you
prefer
the
term
manifest
see
clearly
see
that
ladder
leading
from
plant
man
why
should
suppose
breaks
off
and
does
not
farther
and
farther
feel
that
cannot
vanish
since
nothing
vanishes
this
world
but
that
shall
always
exist
and
always
have
existed
feel
that
beyond
and
above
there
are
spirits
and
that
this
world
there
truth
yes
that
herder
theory
said
prince
andrew
but
not
that
which
can
convince
dear
friend
life
and
death
are
what
convince
what
convinces
when
one
sees
being
dear
one
bound
with
one
own
life
before
whom
one
was
blame
and
had
hoped
make
right
prince
andrew
voice
trembled
and
turned
away
and
suddenly
that
being
seized
with
pain
suffers
and
ceases
exist
why
cannot
that
there
answer
and
believe
there
that
what
convinces
that
what
has
convinced
said
prince
andrew
yes
yes
course
said
pierre
isn
that
what
saying
all
say
that
not
argument
that
convinces
the
necessity
future
life
but
this
when
you
hand
hand
with
someone
and
all
once
that
person
vanishes
there
into
nowhere
and
you
yourself
are
left
facing
that
abyss
and
look
and
have
looked
well
that
then
you
know
that
there
there
and
there
someone
there
the
future
life
the
someone
god
prince
andrew
did
not
reply
the
carriage
and
horses
had
long
since
been
taken
off
onto
the
farther
bank
and
reharnessed
the
sun
had
sunk
half
below
the
horizon
and
evening
frost
was
starring
the
puddles
near
the
ferry
but
pierre
and
andrew
the
astonishment
the
footmen
coachmen
and
ferrymen
still
stood
the
raft
and
talked
there
god
and
future
life
there
truth
and
good
and
man
highest
happiness
consists
striving
attain
them
must
live
must
love
and
must
believe
that
live
not
only
today
this
scrap
earth
but
have
lived
and
shall
live
forever
there
the
whole
said
pierre
and
pointed
the
sky
prince
andrew
stood
leaning
the
railing
the
raft
listening
pierre
and
gazed
with
his
eyes
fixed
the
red
reflection
the
sun
gleaming
the
blue
waters
there
was
perfect
stillness
pierre
became
silent
the
raft
had
long
since
stopped
and
only
the
waves
the
current
beat
softly
against
below
prince
andrew
felt
the
sound
the
waves
kept
refrain
pierre
words
whispering
true
believe
sighed
and
glanced
with
radiant
childlike
tender
look
pierre
face
flushed
and
rapturous
but
yet
shy
before
his
superior
friend
yes
only
were
said
prince
andrew
however
time
get
added
and
stepping
off
the
raft
looked
the
sky
which
pierre
had
pointed
and
for
the
first
time
since
austerlitz
saw
that
high
everlasting
sky
had
seen
while
lying
that
battlefield
and
something
that
had
long
been
slumbering
something
that
was
best
within
him
suddenly
awoke
joyful
and
youthful
his
soul
vanished
soon
returned
the
customary
conditions
his
life
but
knew
that
this
feeling
which
did
not
know
how
develop
existed
within
him
his
meeting
with
pierre
formed
epoch
prince
andrew
life
though
outwardly
continued
live
the
same
old
way
inwardly
began
new
life
chapter
xiii
was
getting
dusk
when
prince
andrew
and
pierre
drove
the
front
entrance
the
house
bald
hills
they
approached
the
house
prince
andrew
with
smile
drew
pierre
attention
commotion
going
the
back
porch
woman
bent
with
age
with
wallet
her
back
and
short
long
haired
young
man
black
garment
had
rushed
back
the
gate
seeing
the
carriage
driving
two
women
ran
out
after
them
and
all
four
looking
round
the
carriage
ran
dismay
the
steps
the
back
porch
those
are
mary
god
folk
said
prince
andrew
they
have
mistaken
for
father
this
the
one
matter
which
she
disobeys
him
orders
these
pilgrims
driven
away
but
she
receives
them
but
what
are
god
folk
asked
pierre
prince
andrew
had
time
answer
the
servants
came
out
meet
them
and
asked
where
the
old
prince
was
and
whether
was
expected
back
soon
the
old
prince
had
gone
the
town
and
was
expected
back
any
minute
prince
andrew
led
pierre
his
own
apartments
which
were
always
kept
perfect
order
and
readiness
for
him

pierre
when

hiding
now
sitting
with
her
god
folk
will
serve
her
right
she
will
confused
but
you
will
see
her
god
folk
really
very
curious
what
are
god
folk
asked
pierre
come
and
you
see
for
yourself
princess
mary
really
was
disconcerted
and
red
patches
came
her
face
when
they
went
her
snug
room
with
lamps
burning
before
the
icon
stand
young
lad
with
long
nose
and
long
hair
wearing
monk
cassock
sat
the
sofa
beside
her
behind
samovar
near
them
armchair
sat
thin
shriveled
old
woman
with
meek
expression
her
childlike
face
andrew
why
didn
you
warn
said
the
princess
with
mild
reproach
she
stood
before
her
pilgrims
like
hen
before
her
chickens
charmee

tres
contente

she
said
pierre
kissed
her
hand
she
had
known
him
child
and
now
his
friendship
with
andrew
his
misfortune
with
his
wife
and
above
all
his
kindly
simple
face
disposed
her
favorably
toward
him
she
looked
him
with
her
beautiful
radiant
eyes
and
seemed
say
like
you
very
much
but
please
don
laugh
people
after
exchanging
the
first
greetings
they
sat
down
delighted
see
you
very
glad

said
prince
andrew
glancing
with
smile
the
young
pilgrim
andrew
said
princess

imploringly

prince
andrew
pierre
andrew

princess
mary
repeated
you
must
know
that
this
woman
for
heaven
sake
was
evident
that
prince
andrew
ironical
tone
toward
the
pilgrims
and
princess
mary
helpless
attempts
protect
them
were
their
customary
long
established
relations
the
matter
mais

prince
andrew

pierre
gazing
over
his
spectacles
with
curiosity
and
seriousness
for
which
princess
mary
was
specially
grateful
him
into
ivanushka

who
seeing
that
she
was
being
spoken
about
looked
round
them
all
with
crafty
eyes
princess
mary
embarrassment
her
people
account
was
quite
unnecessary
they
were
not
the
least
abashed
the
old
woman
lowering
her
eyes
but
casting
side
glances
the
newcomers
had
turned
her
cup
upside
down
and
placed
nibbled
bit
sugar
beside
and
sat
quietly
her
armchair
though
hoping
offered
another
cup
tea
ivanushka
sipping
out
her
saucer
looked
with
sly
womanish
eyes
from
under
her
brows
the
young
men
where

andrew
asked
the
old

now
pierre
that
she

gradually
reassured
chapter

had
spent
two
days
the
catacombs
with
the
saints
pray
awhile
one
ponder
awhile
then
another
sleep
bit
and
then
again
and
kiss
the

and
there
was
such
peace
all
around
such
blessedness
that
one

out
even
into
the
light
heaven
again
pierre
listened
her
attentively
and
seriously
prince
andrew
went
out
the
room
and
then
leaving
god
folk
finish
their
tea
princess

into
the
drawing

she
said
how
you

she
added
hurriedly
not
giving
him
time
reply
her
affectionate
words
very
anxious
about
him
his
health
was
better
the
winter
but
last
spring
his
wound
reopened
and
the
doctor
said
ought
away
for
cure
and
also
very
much
afraid
for
him
spiritually
has
not
character
like
women
who
when
suffer
can
weep
away
our
sorrows
keeps
all
within
him
today
cheerful
and
good
spirits
but
that
the
effect
your
visit
not
often
like
that
you
could
persuade
him
abroad
needs
activity
and
this
quiet
regular
life
very
bad
for
him
others
don
notice
but
see
toward
ten
clock
the
men
servants
rushed
the
front
door
hearing
the
bells
the
old
prince

approaching
prince
andrew
and
pierre
also
went
out
into
the
porch
who

asked
the
old
prince
noticing

got
out
the
carriage
very
glad
kiss
said
having
learned
who
the
young
stranger
was
the
old
prince
was
good
temper
and
very
gracious
pierre
before
supper
prince
andrew
coming
back
his
father
study
found
him
disputing
hotly
with
his
visitor
pierre
was
maintaining
that
time
would
come
when
there
would
more
wars
the
old
prince
disputed
chaffingly
but
without
getting
angry
drain
the
blood
from
men
veins
and
put
water
instead
then
there
will
more
war
old
women
nonsense
old
women
nonsense
repeated
but
still
patted
pierre
affectionately
the
shoulder
and
then
went
the
table
where
prince
andrew
evidently
not
wishing
join
the
conversation
was
looking
over
the
papers
his
father
had
brought
from
town
the
old
prince
went
him
and
began
talk
business
the
marshal
count
rostov
hasn
sent
half
his
contingent
came
town
and
wanted
invite
dinner
gave
him
pretty
dinner
and
there
look
this
well
boy
the
old
prince
went
addressing
his
son
and
patting
pierre
the
shoulder
fine
fellow
your
friend
like
him
stirs
another
says
clever
things
and
one
doesn
care
listen
but
this
one
talks
rubbish
yet
stirs
old
fellow
well
get
along
perhaps
come
and
sit
with
you
supper
have
another
dispute
make
friends
with
little
fool
princess
mary
shouted
after
pierre
through
the
door
only
now
his
visit
bald
hills
did
pierre
fully
realize
the
strength
and
charm
his
friendship
with
prince
andrew
that
charm
was
not
expressed
much
his
relations
with
him
with
all
his
family
and
with
the
household
with
the
stern
old
prince
and
the
gentle
timid
princess
mary
though
had
scarcely
known
them
pierre
once
felt
like
old
friend
they
were
all
fond
him
already
not
only
princess
mary
who
had
been
won
his
gentleness
with
the
pilgrims
gave
him
her
most
radiant
looks
but
even
the
one
year
old
prince
nicholas
his
grandfather
called
him
smiled
pierre
and
let
himself
taken
his
arms
and
michael
ivanovich
and
mademoiselle
bourienne
looked
him
with
pleasant
smiles
when
talked
the
old
prince
the
old
prince
came
supper
this
was
evidently
pierre
account
and
during
the
two
days
the
young
man
visit
was
extremely
kind
him
and
told
him
visit
them
again
when
pierre
had
gone
and
the
members
the
household
met
together
they
began
express
their
opinions
him
people
always
after
new
acquaintance
has
left
but
seldom
happens
one
said
anything
but
what
was
good
him
chapter
when
returning
from
his
leave
rostov
felt
for
the
first
time
how
close
was
the
bond
that
united
him
denisov
and
the
whole
regiment
approaching
rostov
felt
had
done
when
approaching
his
home
moscow
when
saw
the
first
hussar
with
the
unbuttoned
uniform
his
regiment
when
recognized
red
haired
dementyev
and
saw
the
picket
ropes
the
roan
horses
when
lavrushka
gleefully
shouted
his
master
the
count
has
come
and
denisov
who
had
been
asleep
his
bed
ran
all
disheveled
out
the
mud
hut
embrace
him
and
the
officers
collected
round
greet
the
new
arrival
rostov
experienced
the
same
feeling
when
his
mother
his
father
and
his
sister
had
embraced
him
and
tears
joy
choked
him
that
could
not
speak
the
regiment
was
also
home
and
unalterably
dear
and
precious
his
parents
house
when
had
reported
himself
the
commander
the
regiment
and
had
been
reassigned
his
former
squadron
had
been
duty
and
had
gone
out
foraging
when
had
again
entered
into
all
the
little
interests
the
regiment
and
felt
himself
deprived
liberty
and
bound
one
narrow
unchanging
frame
experienced
the
same
sense
peace
moral
support
and
the
same
sense
being
home
here
his
own
place
had
felt
under
the
parental
roof
but
here
was
none
all
that
turmoil
the
world
large
where
did
not
know
his
right
place
and
took
mistaken
decisions
here
was
sonya
with
whom
ought
ought
not
have
explanation
here
was
possibility
going
there
not
going
there
here
there
were
not
twenty
four
hours
the
day
which
could
spent
such
variety
ways
there
was
not
that
innumerable
crowd
people
whom
not
one
was
nearer
him
farther
from
him
than
another
there
were
none
those
uncertain
and
undefined
money
relations
with
his
father
and
nothing
recall
that
terrible
loss
dolokhov
here
the
regiment
all
was
clear
and
simple
the
whole
world
was
divided
into
two
unequal
parts
one
our
pavlograd
regiment
the
other
all
the
rest
and
the
rest
was
concern
his
the
regiment
everything
was
definite
who
was
lieutenant
who
captain
who
was
good
fellow
who
bad
one
and
most
all
who
was
comrade
the
canteenkeeper
gave
one
credit
one
pay
came
every
four
months
there
was
nothing
think
out
decide
you
had
only
nothing
that
was
considered
bad
the
pavlograd
regiment
and
when
given
order
what
was
clearly
distinctly
and
definitely
ordered
and
all
would
well
having
once
more
entered
into
the
definite
conditions
this
regimental
life
rostov
felt
the
joy
and
relief
tired
man
feels
lying
down
rest
life
the
regiment
during
this
campaign
was
all
the
pleasanter
for
him
because
after
his
loss
dolokhov
for
which
spite
all
his
family
efforts
console
him
could
not
forgive
himself
had
made
his
mind
atone
for
his
fault
serving
not
had
done
before
but
really
well
and
being
perfectly
first
rate
comrade
and
officer
word
splendid
man
altogether
thing
which
seemed
difficult
out
the
world
but
possible
the
regiment
after
his
losses
had
determined
pay
back
his
debt
his
parents
five
years
received
ten
thousand
rubles
year
but
now
resolved
take
only
two
thousand
and
leave
the
rest
repay
the
debt
his
parents
our
army
after
repeated
retreats
and
advances
and
battles
pultusk
and
preussisch
eylau
was
concentrated
near
bartenstein
was
awaiting
the
emperor
arrival
and
the
beginning
new
campaign
the
pavlograd
regiment
belonging
that
part
the
army
which
had
served
the
campaign
had
been
recruiting
strength
russia
and
arrived
too
late
take
part
the
first
actions
the
campaign
had
been
neither
pultusk
nor
preussisch
eylau
and
when
joined
the
army
the
field
the
second
half
the
campaign
was
attached
platov
division
platov
division
was
acting
independently
the
main
army
several
times
parts
the
pavlograd
regiment
had
exchanged
shots
with
the
enemy
had
taken
prisoners
and
once
had
even
captured
marshal
oudinot
carriages
april
the
pavlograds
were
stationed
immovably
for
some
weeks
near
totally
ruined
and
deserted
german
village
thaw
had
set
was
muddy
and
cold
the
ice
the
river
broke
and
the
roads
became
impassable
for
days
neither
provisions
for
the
men
nor
fodder
for
the
horses
had
been
issued
transports
could
arrive
the
men
dispersed
about
the
abandoned
and
deserted
villages
searching
for
potatoes
but
found
few
even
these
everything
had
been
eaten
and
the
inhabitants
had
all
fled
any
remained
they
were
worse
than
beggars
and
nothing
more
could
taken
from
them
even
the
soldiers
usually
pitiless
enough
instead
taking
anything
from
them
often
gave
them
the
last
their
rations
the
pavlograd
regiment
had
had
only
two
men
wounded
action
but
had
lost
nearly
half
its
men
from
hunger
and
sickness
the
hospitals
death
was
certain
that
soldiers
suffering
from
fever
the
swelling
that
came
from
bad
food
preferred
remain
duty
and
hardly
able
drag
their
legs
went
the
front
rather
than
the
hospitals
when
spring
came
the
soldiers
found
plant
just
showing
out
the
ground
that
looked
like
asparagus
which
for
some
reason
they
called
mashka
sweet
root
was
very
bitter
but
they
wandered
about
the
fields
seeking
and
dug
out
with
their
sabers
and
ate
though
they
were
ordered
not
was
noxious
plant
that
spring
new
disease
broke
out
among
the
soldiers
swelling
the
arms
legs
and
face
which
the
doctors
attributed
eating
this
root
but
spite
all
this
the
soldiers
denisov
squadron
fed
chiefly
mashka
sweet
root
because
was
the
second
week
that
the
last
the
biscuits
were
being
doled
out
the
rate
half
pound
man
and
the
last
potatoes
received
had
sprouted
and
frozen
the
horses
also
had
been
fed
for
fortnight
straw
from
the
thatched
roofs
and
had
become
terribly
thin
though
still
covered
with
tufts
felty
winter
hair
despite
this
destitution
the
soldiers
and
officers
went
living
just
usual
despite
their
pale
swollen
faces
and
tattered
uniforms
the
hussars
formed
line
for
roll
call
kept
things
order
groomed
their
horses
polished
their
arms
brought
straw
from
the
thatched
roofs
place
fodder
and
sat
down
dine
round
the
caldrons
from
which
they
rose
hungry
joking
about
their
nasty
food
and
their
hunger
usual
their
spare
time
they
lit
bonfires
steamed
themselves
before
them
naked
smoked
picked
out
and
baked
sprouting
rotten
potatoes
told
and
listened
stories
potemkin
and
suvorov
campaigns
legends
alesha
the
sly
the
priest
laborer
mikolka
the
officers
usual
lived
twos
and
threes
the
roofless
half
ruined
houses
the
seniors
tried
collect
straw
and
potatoes
and
general
food
for
the
men
the
younger
ones
occupied
themselves
before
some
playing
cards
there
was
plenty
money
though
there
was
food
some
with
more
innocent
games
such
quoits
and
skittles
the
general
trend
the
campaign
was
rarely
spoken
partly
because
nothing
certain
was
known
about
partly
because
there
was
vague
feeling
that
the
main
was
going
badly
rostov
lived
before
with
denisov
and
since
their
furlough
they
had
become
more
friendly
than
ever
denisov
never
spoke
rostov
family
but
the
tender
friendship
his
commander
showed
him
rostov
felt
that
the
elder
hussar
luckless
love
for
natasha
played
part
strengthening
their
friendship
denisov
evidently
tried
expose
rostov
danger
seldom
possible
and
after
action
greeted
his
safe
return
with
evident
joy
one
his
foraging
expeditions
deserted
and
ruined
village
which
had
come
search
provisions
rostov
found
family
consisting
old
pole
and
his
daughter
with
infant
arms
they
were
half
clad
hungry
too
weak
get
away
foot
and
had
means
obtaining
conveyance
rostov
brought
them
his
quarters
placed
them
his
own
lodging
and
kept
them
for
some
weeks
while
the
old
man
was
recovering
one
his
comrades
talking
women
began
chaffing
rostov
saying
that
was
more
wily
than
any
them
and
that
would
not
bad
thing
introduced
them
the
pretty
polish
girl
had
saved
rostov
took
the
joke
insult
flared
and
said
such
unpleasant
things
the
officer
that
was
all
denisov
could
prevent
duel
when
the
officer
had
gone
away
denisov
who
did
not
himself
know
what
rostov
relations
with
the
polish
girl
might
began
upbraid
him
for
his
quickness
temper
and
rostov
replied
say
what
you
like
she
like
sister
and
can
tell
you
how
offended
because
well
for
that
reason
denisov
patted
him
the
shoulder
and
began
rapidly
pacing
the
room
without
looking
rostov
was
his
way
moments
deep
feeling
what
mad
bweed
you
wostovs
are
muttered
and
rostov
noticed
tears
his
eyes
chapter
xvi
april
the
troops
were
enlivened
news
the
emperor
arrival
but
rostov
had
chance
being
present
the
review
held
bartenstein
the
pavlograds
were
the
outposts
far
beyond
that
place
they
were
bivouacking
denisov
and
rostov
were

hut
dug
out
for
them
the
soldiers
and
roofed
with
branches
and
turf
the

was
made
the
following
manner
which
had
then
come
into
vogue

and
half

wide
four
feet
eight
inches
deep
and
eight
feet
long
one

the
trench
steps
were
cut
out
and
these
formed
the
entrance

the
trench
itself
was
the
room

the
lucky
ones
such
the
squadron
commander
had

opposite
the
entrance
serve
table
each
side
the
trench
the
earth
was
cut
out

and
this
did

couches
the

was
constructed
that

could
stand

middle

one
drew
close
the
table
denisov
who
was
living
luxuriously
because
the
soldiers
his
squadron
liked
him
had
also
board
the
roof
the
farther
end
with
piece
broken
but
mended
glass
for

when
was
very
cold

from

the
reception
room
denisov
called
that
part
the

and
was
then
warm
that
the

whom
there
were
always
some
with

and
rostov
sat
their

night
sent
for

changed
his
rain
soaked
underclothes
said
his
prayers
drank
tea
got
warm
then
tidied
the
things
the
table
and
his
own
corner
and
his
face
glowing
from
exposure
the
wind
and
with
nothing
but
his
shirt
lay
down
his
back
putting
his
arms
under
his
head
was
pleasantly
considering
the
probability
being
promoted
few
days
for
his
last
reconnoitering
expedition
and
was
awaiting
denisov
who
had
gone
out
somewhere
and
with
whom
wanted
talk
suddenly
heard
denisov
shouting
vibrating
voice
behind
the
hut
evidently
much
excited
rostov
moved
the
window
see
whom
was
speaking
and
saw
the
quartermaster
topcheenko
ordered
you
not
let
them
eat
that
mashka
woot
stuff
denisov
was
shouting
and
saw
with
own
eyes
how
lazarchuk
bwought
some
fwom
the
fields
have
given
the
order
again
and
again
your
honor
but
they
don
obey
answered
the
quartermaster
rostov
lay
down
again
his
bed
and
thought
complacently
let
him
fuss
and
bustle
now
job
done
and
lying
down
capitally
could
hear
that
lavrushka
that
sly
bold
orderly
denisov
was
talking
well
the
quartermaster
lavrushka
was
saying
something
about
loaded
wagons
biscuits
and
oxen
had
seen
when
had
gone
out
for
provisions
then
denisov
voice
was
heard
shouting
farther
and
farther
away
saddle
second
platoon
where
are
they
off
now
thought
rostov
five
minutes
later
denisov
came
into
the
hut
climbed
with
muddy
boots
the
bed
lit
his
pipe
furiously
scattered
his
things
about
took
his
leaded
whip
buckled
his
saber
and
went
out
again
answer
rostov
inquiry
where
was
going
answered
vaguely
and
crossly
that
had
some
business
let
god
and
our
gweat
monarch
judge
afterwards
said
denisov
going
out
and
rostov
heard
the
hoofs
several
horses
splashing
through
the
mud
did
not
even
trouble
find
out
where
denisov
had
gone
having
got
warm
his
corner
fell
asleep
and
did
not
leave
the
hut
till
toward
evening
denisov
had
not
yet
returned
the
weather
had
cleared
and
near
the
next
hut
two
officers
and
cadet
were
playing
svayka
laughing
they
threw
their
missiles
which
buried
themselves
the
soft
mud
rostov
joined
them
the
middle
the
game
the
officers
saw
some
wagons
approaching
with
fifteen
hussars
their
skinny
horses
behind
them
the
wagons
escorted
the
hussars
drew
the
picket
ropes
and
crowd

surrounded
them

rostov

denisov
was
bandaged
again
and
put
bed
next
day
woke
calm
and
cheerful
but
noon
the
adjutant
the
regiment
came
into
rostov
and
denisov
dugout
with
grave
and
serious
face
and
regretfully
showed
them
paper
addressed
major
denisov
from
the
regimental
commander
which
inquiries
were
made
about
yesterday
occurrence
the
adjutant
told
them
that
the
affair
was
likely
take
very
bad
turn
that
court
martial
had
been
appointed
and
that
view
the
severity
with
which
marauding
and
insubordination
were
now
regarded
degradation
the
ranks
would
the
best
that
could
hoped
for
the
case
represented
the
offended
parties
was
that
after
seizing
the
transports
major
denisov
being
drunk
went
the
chief
quartermaster
and
without
any
provocation
called
him
thief
threatened
strike
him
and
being
led
out
had
rushed
into
the
office
and
given
two
officials
thrashing
and
dislocated
the
arm
one
them
answer
rostov
renewed
questions
denisov
said
laughing
that
thought
remembered
that
some
other
fellow
had
got
mixed
but
that
was
all
nonsense
and
rubbish
and
did
not
the
least
fear
any
kind
trial
and
that
those
scoundrels
dared
attack
him
would
give
them
answer
that
they
would
not
easily
forget
denisov
spoke
contemptuously
the
whole
matter
but
rostov
knew
him
too
well
not
detect
that
while
hiding
from
others
heart
feared
court
martial
and
was
worried
over
the
affair
which
was
evidently
taking
bad
turn
every
day
letters
inquiry
and
notices
from
the
court
arrived
and
the
first
may
denisov
was
ordered
hand
the
squadron
over
the
next
seniority
and
appear
before
the
staff

parading
his
courage
bullet
fired
french
sharpshooter
hit
him
the
fleshy
part
his
leg
perhaps
another
time
denisov
would
not
have
left
the
regiment
for
slight
wound
but
now
took
advantage
excuse
himself
from
appearing
the
staff
and
went
into
hospital

away
from

and
asked
the
assistant
show
him
the
way
only
don
blame
the
doctor
shouted
after
him
rostov
and
the
assistant
went
into
the
dark
corridor
the
smell
was
strong
there
that
rostov
held
his
nose
and
had
pause
and
collect
his
strength
before
could
door
opened
the
right
and
emaciated
sallow
man
crutches
barefoot
and
underclothing
limped
out
and
leaning
against
the
doorpost
looked
with
glittering
envious
eyes
those
who
were
passing
glancing
the
door
rostov
saw
that
the
sick
and
wounded
were
lying
the
floor
straw
and
overcoats
may
and
look
what
there
see
said
the
assistant
but
just
because
the
assistant
evidently
did
not
want
him
rostov
entered
the
soldiers
ward
the
foul
air
which
had
already
begun
get
used
the
corridor
was
still
stronger
here
was
little
different
more
pungent
and
one
felt
that
this
was
where
originated
the
long
room
brightly
lit
the
sun
through
the
large
windows
the
sick
and
wounded
lay
two
rows
with
their
heads
the
walls
and
leaving
passage
the
middle
most
them
were
unconscious
and
paid
attention
the
newcomers
those
who
were
conscious
raised
themselves
lifted
their
thin
yellow
faces
and
all
looked
intently
rostov
with
the
same
expression
hope
relief
reproach
and
envy
another
health
rostov
went
the
middle
the
room
and
looking
through
the
open
doors
into
the
two
adjoining
rooms
saw
the
same
thing
there
stood
still
looking
silently
around
had
not
all
expected
such
sight
just
before
him
almost
across
the
middle
the
passage
the
bare
floor
lay
sick
man
probably
cossack
judge
the
cut
his
hair
the
man
lay
his
back
his
huge
arms
and
legs
outstretched
his
face
was
purple
his
eyes
were
rolled
back
that
only
the
whites
were
seen
and
his
bare
legs
and
arms
which
were
still
red
the
veins
stood
out
like
cords
was
knocking
the
back
his
head
against
the
floor
hoarsely
uttering
some
word
which
kept
repeating
rostov
listened
and
made
out
the
word
was
drink
drink
drink
rostov
glanced
round
looking
for
someone
who
would
put
this
man
back
his
place
and
bring
him
water
who
looks
after
the
sick
here
asked
the
assistant
just
then
commissariat
soldier
hospital
orderly
came
from
the
next
room
marching
stiffly
and
drew
front
rostov
good

his
eyes
rostov
and
evidently
mistaking
him
for
one
the
hospital
authorities

place
and
give
him
some
water
said
rostov
pointing
the
cossack
yes
your
honor
the
soldier
replied
complacently
and
rolling
his
eyes
more
than
ever
drew
himself
still
straighter
but
did
not
move
impossible
anything
here
thought
rostov
lowering
his
eyes
and
was
going
out
but
became
aware
intense
look
fixed
him
his
right
and
turned
close
the
corner

old
unshaven
gray
bearded
soldier
thin
skeleton
with
stern
sallow
face
and
eyes
intently
fixed
rostov
the
man
neighbor
one
side
whispered
something
him
pointing
rostov
who
noticed
that
the
old
man
wanted
speak
him
drew
nearer
and
saw
that
the
old
man
had
only
one
leg
bent
under
him
the
other
had
been
amputated
above
the
knee
his
neighbor
the
other
side
who
lay
motionless
some
distance
from
him
with
his
head
thrown
back
was
young
soldier
with
snub
nose
his
pale
waxen
face
was
still
freckled
and
his
eyes
were
rolled
back
rostov
looked
the
young
soldier
and
cold
chill
ran
down
his
back
why
this
one
seems
began
turning
the
assistant
and
how
been
begging

honor
said
the
old

said
the
assistant
hurriedly
let
your
honor
yes
yes
let
said
rostov
hastily
and
lowering
his
eyes
and
shrinking
tried
pass
unnoticed
between
the
rows
reproachful
envious
eyes
that
were
fixed
upon
him
and
went
out
the
room
chapter

going
along
the
corridor
the
assistant
led
rostov
the
officers

consisting
three
rooms

between
his
teeth
rostov
looked
him
trying
remember
where
had
seen
him
before
see
where
met
again
said
the
little
man
tushin
tushin
don
you
remember
who
gave
you
lift
schon
grabern
and
had
bit
cut
off
you
see
went
with
smile
pointing
the
empty
sleeve
his
dressing
gown
looking
for
vasili
dmitrich
denisov
neighbor
added
when
heard
who
rostov
wanted
here
here
and
tushin
led
him
into
the
next
room
from
whence
came
sounds
several
laughing
voices
how
can
they
laugh
even
live
all
here
thought
rostov
still
aware
that
smell
decomposing
flesh
that
had
been
strong
the
soldiers
ward
and
still
seeming
see
fixed
him
those
envious
looks
which
had
followed
him
out
from
both
sides
and
the
face
that
young
soldier
with
eyes
rolled
back
denisov
lay
asleep
his
bed
with
his
head
under
the
blanket
though
was
nearly
noon
wostov
how
are
you
how
are
you
called
out
still
the
same
voice
the
regiment
but
rostov
noticed
sadly
that
under
this
habitual
ease
and
animation
some
new
sinister
hidden
feeling
showed
itself
the
expression
denisov
face
and
the
intonations
his
voice
his
wound
though
slight
one
had
not
yet
healed
even
now
six
weeks
after
had
been
hit
his
face
had
the
same
swollen
pallor
the
faces
the
other
hospital
patients
but
was
not
this
that
struck
rostov
what
struck
him
was
that
denisov
did
not
seem
glad
see
him
and
smiled
him
unnaturally
did
not
ask
about
the
regiment
nor
about
the
general
state
affairs
and
when
rostov
spoke
these
matters
did
not
listen
rostov
even
noticed
that
denisov
did
not
like
reminded
the
regiment
general
that
other
free
life
which
was
going
outside
the
hospital
seemed
try
forget
that
old
life
and
was
only
interested
the
affair
with
the
commissariat
officers
rostov
inquiry
how
the
matter
stood
once
produced
from
under
his
pillow
paper
had
received
from
the
commission
and
the
rough
draft
his
answer
became
animated
when
began
reading
his
paper
and
specially
drew
rostov
attention
the
stinging
rejoinders
made
his
enemies
his
hospital
companions
who
had
gathered
round
rostov
fresh
arrival
from
the
world
outside
gradually
began
disperse
soon
denisov
began
reading
his
answer
rostov
noticed
their
faces
that
all
those
gentlemen
had
already
heard
that
story
more
than
once
and
were
tired
only
the
man
who
had
the
next
bed
stout
uhlan
continued
sit
his
bed
gloomily
frowning
and
smoking
pipe
and
little
one
armed
tushin
still
listened
shaking
his
head
disapprovingly
the
middle
the
reading
the
uhlan
interrupted
denisov
but
what
say
said
turning
rostov
would
best
simply
petition
the
emperor
for
pardon
they
say
great
rewards
will
now
distributed
and
surely
pardon
would
granted
petition
the
empewo
exclaimed
denisov
voice
which
tried
hard
give
the
old
energy
and
fire
but
which
sounded
like
expression
irritable
impotence
what
for

ask

denisov
interrupted
him
went
reading
his
paper
rostov
had
not
the
courage
persuade
denisov
though
instinctively
felt
that
the
way
advised
tushin
and
the
other
officers
was
the
safest
and
though
would
have
been
glad
service
denisov
knew
his
stubborn
will
and
straightforward
hasty
temper
when
the
reading
denisov
virulent
reply
which
took
more
than
hour
was
over
rostov
said
nothing
and
spent
the
rest
the
day
most
dejected
state
mind
amid
denisov
hospital
comrades
who
had
gathered
round
him
telling
them
what
knew
and
listening
their
stories
denisov
was
moodily
silent
all
the
evening
late
the
evening
when
rostov
was
about
leave
asked
denisov
whether
had
commission
for
him
yes
wait
bit
said
denisov
glancing
round
the
officers
and
taking
his
papers
from
under
his
pillow
went
the
window
where
had
inkpot
and
sat
down
write
seems
use
knocking
one
head
against
wall
said
coming
from
the
window
and
giving
rostov
large
envelope
was
the
petition
the
emperor
drawn
the
auditor
which
denisov
without
alluding
the
offenses
the
commissariat
officials
simply
asked
for
pardon
hand
seems
did
not
finish
but
gave
painfully
unnatural
smile

and
saw
how
napoleon
reaching
the
raft
first
stepped
quickly
forward
meet
alexander
and
held
out
his
hand
him
and
how
they
both
retired
into
the
pavilion
since
had
begun
move
the
highest
circles
boris
had
made
his
habit
watch
attentively
all
that
went
around
him
and
note
down
the
time
the
meeting
tilsit
asked
the
names
those
who
had
come
with

and
about
the
uniforms

moment

and
did
not
forget
look
again
when

came
out
the
interview
had
lasted
hour
and
fifty
three
minutes
noted
this
down
that
same
evening
among
other
facts
felt
historic
importance
the
emperor
suite
was
very
small
one
was
matter
great
importance
for
man
who
valued
his
success
the
service
tilsit
the
occasion
this
interview
between
the
two
emperors
and
having
succeeded
this
boris
felt
that
henceforth
his
position
was
fully
assured
had
not
only
become
known
but
people
had
grown
accustomed
him
and
accepted
him
twice
had
executed
commissions
the
emperor
himself
that
the
latter
knew
his
face
and
all
those
court
far
from
cold
shouldering
him
first
when
they
considered
him
newcomer
would
now
have
been
surprised
had
been

with
another
adjutant

and
passionately
fond

and
almost
every
day
the
stay
tilsit
french
officers
the

and
from
french

were
dining
and
lunching
with
him
and

profiting

came
tilsit
and
went
the
lodging
occupied
boris
and
zhilinski
rostov
common
with
the
whole
army
from
which
came
was
far
from
having
experienced
the
change
feeling
toward
napoleon
and
the
french
who
from
being
foes
had
suddenly
become
friends
that
had
taken
place
headquarters
and
boris
the
army
bonaparte
and
the
french
were
still
regarded
with
mingled
feelings
anger
contempt
and
fear
only
recently
talking
with
one
platov
cossack
officers
rostov
had
argued
that
napoleon
were
taken
prisoner
would
treated
not
sovereign
but
criminal
quite
lately
happening
meet
wounded
french
colonel
the
road
rostov
had
maintained
with
heat
that
peace
was
impossible
between
legitimate
sovereign
and
the
criminal
bonaparte
rostov
was
therefore
unpleasantly
struck
the
presence
french
officers
boris
lodging
dressed
uniforms
had
been
accustomed
see
from
quite
different
point
view
from
the
outposts
the
flank
soon
noticed
french
officer
who
thrust
his
head
out
the
door
that
warlike
feeling
hostility
which
always
experienced
the
sight
the
enemy
suddenly
seized
him
stopped
the
threshold
and
asked
russian
whether
drubetskoy
lived
there
boris
hearing
strange
voice
the
anteroom
came
out
meet
him
expression
annoyance
showed
itself
for
moment
his
face
first
recognizing
rostov
you
very
glad
very
glad
see
you
said
however
coming
toward
him
with
smile
but
rostov
had
noticed
his
first
impulse
come
bad
time
think
should
not
have
come
but
have
business
said
coldly
only
wonder
how
you
managed
get
away
from
your
regiment
dans
moment
suis
vous
said
answering
someone
who
called
him
minute
shall
your
disposal
see
intruding
rostov
repeated
the
look
annoyance
had
already
disappeared
from
boris
face
having
evidently
reflected
and
decided
how
act
very
quietly
took
both
rostov
hands
and
led
him
into
the
next
room
his
eyes
looking
serenely
and
steadily
rostov
seemed
veiled
something
screened
blue
spectacles
conventionality
seemed
rostov
come
now
you
could
come
wrong
time
said
boris
and
led
him
into
the
room
where
the
supper
table
was
laid
and
introduced
him
his
guests
explaining
that
was
not
civilian
but
hussar
officer
and
old
friend
his
count
zhilinski
comte
capitaine
said
naming
his
guests
rostov
looked
frowningly
the
frenchmen
bowed
reluctantly
and
remained
silent
zhilinski
evidently
did
not
receive
this
new
russian
person
very
willingly
into
his
circle
and
did
not
speak
rostov
boris
did
not
appear
notice
the
constraint
the
newcomer
produced
and
with
the
same
pleasant
composure
and
the
same
veiled
look
his
eyes
with
which
had
met
rostov
tried
enliven
the
conversation
one
the
frenchmen
with
the
politeness
characteristic
his
countrymen
addressed
the
obstinately
taciturn
rostov
saying
that
the
latter
had
probably
come
tilsit
see
the
emperor
came
business
replied
rostov
briefly
rostov
had
been
out
humor
from
the
moment
noticed
the
look
dissatisfaction
boris
face
and
always
happens
those
bad
humor
seemed
him
that
everyone
regarded
him
with
aversion
and
that
was
everybody
way
really
was
their
way
for
alone
took
part
the
conversation
which
again
became
general
the
looks
the
visitors
cast
him
seemed
say
and
what
sitting
here
for
rose
and
went
boris
anyhow
your
way
said
low
tone
come
and
talk
over
business
and
away
not
all
said
boris
but
you
are
tired
come
and
lie
down
room
and
have
rest
yes
really
they
went
into
the
little
room
where
boris
slept
rostov
without
sitting
down
began
once
irritably
boris
were
blame
some
way
telling
him
about
denisov
affair
asking
him
whether
through
his
general
could
and
would
intercede
with
the
emperor
denisov
behalf
and
get
denisov
petition
handed
when
and
boris
were
alone
rostov
felt
for
the
first
time
that
could
not
look
boris
the
face
without
sense
awkwardness
boris
with
one
leg
crossed
over
the
other
and
stroking
his
left
hand
with
the
slender
fingers
his
right
listened
rostov
general
listens
the
report
subordinate
now
looking
aside
and
now
gazing
straight
into
rostov
eyes
with
the
same
veiled
look
each
time
this
happened
rostov
felt
uncomfortable
and
cast
down
his
eyes
have
heard
such
cases
and
know
that
his
majesty
very
severe
such
affairs
think
would
best
not
bring
before
the
emperor
but
apply
the
commander
the
corps
but
general
think
you
don
want
anything
well
then
say
rostov
almost
shouted
not
looking
boris
the
face
boris
smiled
the
contrary
will
what
can
only
thought
that
moment
zhilinski
voice
was
heard
calling
boris
well
then
said
rostov
and
refusing
supper
and
remaining
alone
the
little
room
walked
and
down
for
long
time
hearing
the
lighthearted
french
conversation
from
the
next
room
chapter
rostov
had
come
tilsit
the
day
least
suitable
for
petition
denisov
behalf
could
not
himself
the
general
attendance
was
mufti
and
had
come
tilsit
without
permission
and
boris
even
had
wished
could
not
have
done
the
following
day
that
day
june
the
preliminaries
peace
were
signed
the
emperors
exchanged
decorations
alexander
received
the
cross
the
legion
honor
and
napoleon
the
order
andrew
the
first
degree
and
dinner
had
been
arranged
for
the
evening
given
battalion
the
french
guards
the
preobrazhensk
battalion
the
emperors
were
present
that
banquet
rostov
felt
ill
ease
and
uncomfortable
with
boris
that
when
the
latter
looked
after
supper
pretended
asleep
and
early
next
morning
went
away
avoiding
boris
his
civilian
clothes
and
round
hat
wandered
about
the
town
staring
the
french
and
their
uniforms
and
the
streets
and
houses
where
the
russian
and
french
emperors
were
staying
square
saw
tables
being
set
and
preparations
made
for
the
dinner
saw
the
russian
and
french
colors
draped
from
side
side
the
streets
with
huge
monograms
and
the
windows
the
houses
also
flags
and
bunting
were
displayed
boris
doesn
want
help
and
don
want
ask
him
that
settled
thought
nicholas
all
over
between
but
won
leave
here
without
having
done
all
can
for
denisov
and
certainly
not
without
getting
his
letter
the
emperor
the
emperor
here
thought
rostov
who
had
unconsciously
returned
the
house
where
alexander
lodged
saddled
horses
were
standing
before
the
house
and
the
suite
were
assembling
evidently
preparing
for
the
emperor
come
out
may
see
him
any
moment
thought
rostov
only
were
hand
the
letter
direct
him
and
tell
him
all
could
they
really
arrest
for
civilian
clothes
surely
not
would
understand
whose
side
justice
lies
understands
everything
knows
everything
who
can
more
just
more
magnanimous
than
and
even
they
did
arrest
for
being
here
what
would
matter
thought
looking
officer
who
was
entering
the
house
the
emperor
occupied
after
all
people
all
nonsense
and
hand
the
letter
the
emperor
myself
much
the
worse
for
drubetskoy
who
drives
and
suddenly
with
determination
himself
did
not
expect
rostov
felt
for
the
letter
his
pocket
and
went
straight
the
house
won
miss
opportunity
now
did
after
austerlitz
thought
expecting
every
moment
meet
the
monarch
and
conscious
the
blood
that
rushed
his
heart
the
thought
will
fall
his
feet
and
beseech
him
will
lift
will
listen
and
will
even
thank
happy
when
can
good
but
remedy
injustice
the
greatest
happiness
rostov
fancied
the
sovereign
saying
and
passing
people
who
looked
after
him
with
curiosity
entered
the
porch
the
emperor
house
broad
staircase
led
straight
from
the
entry
and
the
right
saw
closed
door
below
under
the
staircase
was
door
leading
the
lower
floor
whom
you
want
someone
inquired
hand
letter
petition
his
majesty
said
nicholas
with
tremor
his
voice
petition
this
way
the
officer
duty
was
shown
the
door
leading
downstairs
only
won
accepted
hearing
this
indifferent
voice
rostov
grew
frightened
what
was
doing
the
thought
meeting
the
emperor
any
moment
was
fascinating
and
consequently
alarming
that
was
ready
run
away
but
the
official
who
had
questioned
him
opened
the
door
and
rostov
entered
short
stout
man
about
thirty
white
breeches
and
high
boots
and
batiste
shirt
that
had
evidently
only
just
put
standing
that
room
and
his
valet
was
buttoning
the
back
his
breeches
new
pair
handsome
silk
embroidered
braces
that
for
some
reason
attracted
rostov
attention
this
man
was
speaking
someone
the
adjoining
room
good
figure
and
her
first
bloom
was
saying
but
seeing
rostov
stopped
short
and
frowned
what
petition
what
asked
the
person
the
other
room
another
petitioner
answered
the
man
with
the
braces
tell
him
come
later
coming
out
directly
must
later
later
tomorrow
too
late
rostov
turned
and
was
about
but
the
man
the
braces
stopped
him
whom
have
you
come
from
who
are
you
come
from
major
denisov
answered
rostov
are
you
officer
lieutenant
count
rostov
what
audacity
hand
through
your
commander

went
back
into
the
hall
and
noticed
that
the
porch
there
were
many
officers
and
generals
full
parade
uniform
whom
had
pass
cursing
his
temerity
his
heart
sinking
the
thought
finding
himself
any
moment
face
face
with
the
emperor
and
being
put
shame
and
arrested
his
presence
fully
alive
now
the
impropriety
his
conduct
and
repenting
rostov
with
downcast
eyes
was
making
his
way
out
the
house
through
the
brilliant
suite
when
familiar
voice
called
him
and
hand
detained
him

doing
here
sir

asked

was
cavalry

who
had
obtained
the
emperor
special
favor
during
this
campaign
and
who
had
formerly
commanded
the
division
which
rostov
was
serving
rostov
dismay
began
justifying
himself
but
seeing
the
kindly
jocular
face
the
general
took
him
aside
and
excited
voice
told
him
the
whole
affair
asking
him
intercede
for
denisov
whom
the
general
knew
having
heard
rostov
the
end
the
general
shook
his
head
gravely
sorry
sorry
for
that
fine
fellow
give
the
letter
hardly
had
rostov
handed
him
the
letter
and
finished
explaining
denisov
case
when
hasty
steps
and
the
jingling
spurs
were
heard
the
stairs
and
the
general
leaving
him
went
the
porch
the
gentlemen
the
emperor

ran
down
the
stairs
and
went

the

groom
who
had
been
austerlitz
led
the

horse
and
the
faint
creak
footstep
rostov
knew
once
was
heard
the
stairs
forgetting
the
danger
being
recognized
rostov
went
close
the
porch
together
with
some
inquisitive
civilians
and
again
after
two
years
saw
those
features
adored
that
same
face
and
same
look
and
step
and
the
same
union
majesty
and
mildness
and
the
feeling
enthusiasm
and
love
for
his
sovereign
rose
again

came
out
into
the
porch
putting
his
gloves
and
carrying
his
hat
under
his
arm
stopped
and
looked
about
him
brightening
everything
around
his
glance
spoke
few
words
some
the
generals
and
recognizing
the
former
commander
rostov

smiled
and
beckoned
him
all
the
suite
drew
back
and
rostov
saw
the
general
talking
for
some
time
the
emperor
the
emperor
said
few
words
him
and
took
step
toward
his
horse
again
the
crowd

the

among

moved
nearer
the

stopping
beside

with
his

the
emperor
turned
the
cavalry
general
and
said
loud

evidently
wishing

the
law
stronger
than

raised
his
foot
the

the
general
bowed
his
head
respectfully
and
the

mounted
and
rode
down
the
street
gallop
beside
himself
with
enthusiasm
rostov
ran
after
him
with
the
crowd
chapter

the

rode

did
rostov
with

noticing
that

did
not
sit
well
firmly

the

shouted
hurrah
and
vive
empereur
napoleon
said
something
alexander
and
both
emperors
dismounted
and
took
each
other
hands
napoleon
face
wore
unpleasant
and
artificial
smile
alexander
was
saying
something
affable
him
spite
the
trampling
the
french
gendarmes
horses
which
were
pushing
back
the
crowd
rostov
kept
his
eyes
every
movement
alexander
and
bonaparte
struck
him
surprise
that
alexander
treated
bonaparte
equal
and
that
the
latter
was
quite
ease
with
the
tsar
such
relations
with
emperor
were
everyday
matter
him
alexander
and
napoleon
with
the
long
train
their
suites
approached
the
right
flank
the
preobrazhensk
battalion
and
came
straight
the
crowd
standing
there
the
crowd
unexpectedly
found
itself
close
the
emperors
that
rostov
standing
the
front
row
was
afraid
might
recognized
sire
ask
your
permission
present
the
legion
honor
the
bravest
your
soldiers
said
sharp
precise
voice
articulating
every
letter
this
was
said
the
undersized
napoleon
looking
straight
into
alexander
eyes
alexander
listened
attentively
what
was
said
him
and
bending
his
head
smiled
pleasantly
him
who
has
borne
himself
most
bravely
this
last
war
added
napoleon
accentuating
each
syllable
with
composure
and
assurance
exasperating
rostov
ran
his
eyes
over
the
russian
ranks
drawn
before
him
who
all
presented
arms
with
their
eyes
fixed
their
emperor

alexander
and
took
few
hasty
steps
toward

laid

and
dropping
his

turned
toward
alexander
though
sure
that
the
cross
would
adhere
there
and
really
did
officious
hands
russian
and
french
immediately
seized
the
cross
and
fastened
the
uniform
lazarev
glanced
morosely
the
little
man
with
white
hands
who
was
doing
something
him
and
still
standing
motionless
presenting
arms
looked
again
straight
into
alexander
eyes
asking
whether
should
stand
there
away
something
else
but
receiving
orders
remained
for
some
time
that
rigid
position
the
emperors
remounted
and
rode
away
the
preobrazhensk

breaking

mingled
with
the

and
sat
down

russian

filled
the

round

rostov
how
you
missed

another
said
and
could
not
refrain
from
asking
what
was
the
matter
strangely
dismal
and
troubled
was
rostov
face
nothing
nothing
replied
rostov
you
call
round
yes
will
rostov
stood
that
corner
for
long
time
watching
the
feast
from
distance
his
mind
painful
process
was
going
which
could
not
bring
conclusion
terrible
doubts
rose
his
soul
now
remembered
denisov
with
his
changed
expression
his
submission
and
the
whole
hospital
with
arms
and
legs
torn
off
and
its
dirt
and
disease
vividly
did
recall
that
hospital
stench
dead
flesh
that
looked
round
see
where
the
smell
came
from
next
thought
that
self
satisfied
bonaparte
with
his
small
white
hand
who
was
now
emperor
liked
and
respected
alexander
then
why
those
severed
arms
and
legs
and
those
dead
men
then
again
thought
lazarev
rewarded
and
denisov
punished
and
unpardoned
caught
himself
harboring
such
strange
thoughts
that
was
frightened
the
smell
the
food
the
preobrazhenskis
were
eating
and
sense
hunger
recalled
him
from
these
reflections
had
get
something
eat
before
going
away
went
hotel
had
noticed
that
morning
there
found
many
people
among
them
officers
who
like
himself
had
come
civilian
clothes
that
had
difficulty
getting
dinner
two
officers
his
own
division
joined
him
the
conversation
naturally
turned
the
peace
the
officers
his
comrades
like
most
the
army
were
dissatisfied
with
the
peace
concluded
after
the
battle
friedland
they
said
that
had
held
out
little
longer
napoleon
would
have
been
done
for
his
troops
had
neither
provisions
nor
ammunition
nicholas
ate
and
drank
chiefly
the
latter
silence
finished
couple
bottles
wine
himself
the
process
his
mind
went
tormenting
him
without
reaching
conclusion
feared
give
way
his
thoughts
yet
could
not
get
rid
them
suddenly
one
the
officers
saying
that
was
humiliating
look
the
french
rostov
began
shouting
with
uncalled
for
wrath
and
therefore
much
the
surprise
the
officers
how
can
you
judge
what
best
cried
the
blood
suddenly
rushing
his
face
how
can
you
judge
the
emperor
actions
what
right
have
argue
cannot
comprehend
either
the
emperor
aims
his
actions
but
never
said
word
about
the
emperor
said
the
officer
justifying
himself
and
unable
understand
rostov
outburst
except
the
supposition
that
was
drunk
but
rostov
did
not
listen
him
are
not
diplomatic
officials
are
soldiers
and
nothing
more
went
are
ordered
die
must
die
punished
means
that
have
deserved
not
for
judge
the
emperor
pleases
recognize
bonaparte
emperor
and
conclude
alliance
with
him
means
that
that
the
right
thing
once
begin
judging
and
arguing
about
everything
nothing
sacred
will
left
that
way
shall
saying
there
god
nothing
shouted
nicholas
banging
the
table
very
little
the
point
seemed
his
listeners
but
quite
relevantly
the
course
his
own
thoughts
our
business
our
duty

and
not
think
that
all
said

evidently
long

some
its
branches
had
been
broken
off
and
its
bark
scarred
with
its
huge
ungainly
limbs
sprawling
unsymmetrically
and
its
gnarled
hands
and
fingers
stood
aged
stern
and
scornful
monster
among
the
smiling
birch
trees
only
the
dead

dotted
about

turned
several
times
look
that
oak
expecting
something
from
under

and

but
stood
among
them
scowling
rigid
misshapen
and
grim
ever

mournfully
pleasant
rose
his
soul
connection
with
that
tree
during
this
journey
were
considered
his
life
afresh
and
arrived
his
old
conclusion
restful
its
hopelessness
that
was
not
for
him
begin
anything
anew
but
that
must
live
out
his
life
content

and
not
disturbing

andrew
depressed
and
preoccupied
with
the
business
about
which
had

the
marshal
was
driving
the
avenue
the
grounds
the
rostovs
house
otradnoe
heard
merry
girlish
cries
behind
some
trees
the
right
and
saw
group
girls
running
cross
the
path
his
caleche
ahead
the
rest
and
nearer
him
ran
dark
haired
remarkably
slim
pretty
girl
yellow
chintz
dress
with
white
handkerchief
her
head
from
under
which
loose
locks
hair
escaped
the
girl
was
shouting
something
but
seeing
that
was
stranger
ran
back
laughing
without
looking
him
suddenly
did
not
know
why
felt
pang
the
day
was
beautiful
the
sun
bright
everything
around
gay
but
that
slim
pretty
girl
did
not
know
wish
know
his
existence
and
was
contented
and
cheerful
her
own
separate
probably
foolish
but
bright
and
happy
life
what
she
glad
about
what
she
thinking
not
the
military
regulations
the
arrangement
the
ryazan
serfs

what
she
thinking
why

happy
prince
andrew
asked
himself
with
instinctive
curiosity
count
ilya
rostov
was
living
otradnoe
just
had
done
former
years
that
entertaining
almost
the
whole
province
with
hunts
theatricals
dinners
and
music
was
glad
see
prince
andrew
was
see
any
new
visitor
and
insisted
his
staying
the
night
during
the
dull
day
the
course
which
was
entertained
his
elderly
hosts
and
the
more
important
the
visitors
the
old
count
house
was
crowded
account
approaching
name
day
prince
andrew
repeatedly
glanced
natasha
gay
and
laughing
among
the
younger
members
the
company
and
asked
himself
each
time
what
she
thinking
about
why
she
glad
that
night
alone
new
surroundings
was
long
unable
sleep
read
awhile
and
then
put
out
his
candle
but
relit
was
hot
the
room
the
inside
shutters
which
were
closed
was
cross
with
the
stupid
old
man
called
rostov
who
had
made
him
stay
assuring
him
that
some
necessary
documents
had
not
yet
arrived
from
town
and
was
vexed
with
himself
for
having
stayed
got
and
went
the
window
open
soon
opened
the
shutters
the
moonlight
had
long
been
watching
for
this
burst
into
the
room
opened
the
casement
the
night
was
fresh
bright
and
very
still
just
before
the
window
was
row
pollard
trees
looking
black
one
side
and
with
silvery
light
the
other
beneath
the
trees
grew
some
kind
lush
wet
bushy
vegetation
with
silver
lit
leaves
and
stems
here
and
there
farther
back
beyond
the
dark
trees
roof
glittered
with
dew
the
right
was
leafy
tree
with
brilliantly
white
trunk
and
branches
and
above
shone
the
moon
nearly
its
full
pale
almost
starless
spring
sky
prince
andrew
leaned
his
elbows
the
window
ledge
and
his
eyes
rested
that
sky
his
room
was
the
first
floor
those
the
rooms
above
were
also
awake
heard
female
voices
overhead
just
once
more
said
girlish
voice
above
him
which
prince
andrew
recognized
once
but
when
are
you
coming
bed
replied
another
voice
won
can
sleep
what
the
use
come
now
for
the
last
time
two
girlish
voices
sang
musical
passage
the
end
some
song
how
lovely
now
sleep
and
there
end
you
sleep
but
can
said
the
first
voice
coming
nearer
the
window
she
was
evidently
leaning
right
out
for
the
rustle
her
dress
and
even
her
breathing
could
heard
everything
was
stone
still
like
the
moon
and
its
light
and
the
shadows
prince
andrew
too
dared
not
stir
for
fear
betraying
his
unintentional
presence
sonya
sonya
again
heard
the
first
speaker
how
can
you
sleep
only
look
how
glorious
how
glorious
wake
sonya
she
said
almost
with
tears
her
voice
there
never
never
was
such
lovely
night
before
sonya
made
some
reluctant
reply
just
come
and
see
what
moon
how
lovely
come
here
darling
sweetheart
come
here
there
you
see
feel
like
sitting
down
heels
putting
arms
round
knees
like
this
straining
tight
tight
possible
and
flying
away
like
this
take
care
you
fall
out
heard
the
sound
scuffle
and
sonya
disapproving
voice
past
one
clock
you
only
spoil
things
for
all
right
again
all
was
silent
but
prince
andrew
knew
she
was
still
sitting
there
from
time
time
heard
soft
rustle
and
times
sigh
god
god
what
does
mean
she
suddenly
exclaimed
bed
then
must
and
she
slammed
the
casement
for
her
might
well
not
exist
thought
prince
andrew
while
listened
her
voice
for
some
reason
expecting
yet
fearing
that
she
might
say
something
about
him
there
she
again
were
purpose
thought
his
soul
there
suddenly
arose
such
unexpected
turmoil
youthful
thoughts
and
hopes
contrary
the
whole
tenor
his
life
that
unable
explain
his
condition
himself
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
once
chapter
iii
next
morning
having
taken
leave
one
but
the
count
and
not
waiting
for
the
ladies
appear
prince
andrew
set
off
for
home
was
already
the
beginning
june
when
his
return
journey
drove
into
the
birch
forest
where
the
gnarled
old
oak
had
made
strange
and
memorable
impression
him
the
forest
the
harness
bells
sounded
yet
more
muffled
than
they
had
done
six
weeks
before
for
now
all
was
thick
shady
and
dense
and
the
young
firs
dotted
about
the
forest
did
not
jar
the
general
beauty
but
lending
themselves
the
mood
around
were
delicately
green
with
fluffy
young
shoots
the
whole
day
had
been
hot
somewhere
storm
was
gathering
but
only
small
cloud
had
scattered
some
raindrops
lightly
sprinkling
the
road
and
the
sappy
leaves
the
left
side
the
forest
was
dark
the
shade
the
right
side
glittered
the
sunlight
wet
and
shiny
and
scarcely
swayed
the
breeze
everything
was
blossom
the
nightingales
trilled
and
their
voices
reverberated
now
near
now
far
away
yes
here
this
forest
was
that
oak
with
which
agreed
thought
prince
andrew
but
where
again
wondered
gazing
the
left
side
the
road
and
without
recognizing
looked
with
admiration
the
very
oak
sought
the
old
oak
quite
transfigured
spreading
out
canopy
sappy
dark
green
foliage
stood
rapt
and
slightly
trembling
the
rays
the
evening
sun
neither
gnarled
fingers
nor
old
scars
nor
old
doubts
and
sorrows
were
any
them
evidence
now
through
the
hard
century
old
bark
even
where
there
were
twigs
leaves
had
sprouted
such
one
could
hardly
believe
the
old
veteran
could
have
produced
yes
the
same
oak
thought
prince
andrew
and
all
once
was
seized
unreasoning
springtime
feeling
joy
and
renewal
all
the
best
moments
his
life
suddenly
rose
his
memory
austerlitz
with
the
lofty
heavens
his
wife
dead
reproachful
face
pierre
the
ferry
that
girl
thrilled
the
beauty
the
night
and
that
night
itself
and
the
moon
and
all
this
rushed
suddenly
his
mind
life
not
over
thirty
one
prince
andrew
suddenly
decided
finally
and
decisively
not
enough
for
know
what
have
everyone
must
know
pierre
and
that
young
girl
who
wanted
fly
away
into
the
sky
everyone
must
know
that
life
may
not
lived
for
myself
alone
while
others
live
apart
from
but
that
may
reflected
them
all
and
they
and
may
live
harmony
reaching
home
prince
andrew
decided
petersburg
that
autumn
and
found
all
sorts
reasons
for
this
decision
whole
series
sensible
and
logical
considerations
showing
essential
for
him
petersburg
and
even
enter
the
service
kept
springing
his
mind
could
not
now
understand
how
could
ever
even
have
doubted
the
necessity
taking
active
share
life
just
month
before
had
not
understood
how
the
idea
leaving
the
quiet
country
could
ever
enter
his
head
now
seemed
clear
him
that
all
his
experience
life
must
senselessly
wasted
unless
applied
some
kind
work
and
again
played
active
part
life
did
not
even
remember
how
formerly
the
strength
similar
wretched
logical
arguments
had
seemed
obvious
that
would
degrading
himself
now
after
the
lessons
had
had
life
allowed
himself
believe
the
possibility
being
useful
and
the
possibility
happiness
love
now
reason
suggested
quite
the
opposite
after
that
journey
ryazan
found
the
country
dull
his
former
pursuits
longer
interested
him
and
often
when
sitting
alone
his
study
got
went
the
mirror
and
gazed
long
time
his
own
face
then
would
turn
away
the
portrait
his
dead
lise
who
with
hair
curled
grecque
looked
tenderly
and
gaily
him
out
the
gilt
frame
she
did
not
now
say
those
former
terrible
words
him
but
looked
simply
merrily
and
inquisitively
him
and
prince
andrew
crossing
his
arms
behind
him
long
paced
the
room
now
frowning
now
smiling
reflected
those
irrational
inexpressible
thoughts
secret
crime
which
altered
his
whole
life
and
were
connected
with
pierre
with
fame
with
the
girl
the
window
the
oak
and
woman
beauty
and
love
and
anyone
came
into
his
room
such
moments
was
particularly
cold
stern
and
above
all
unpleasantly
logical
dear
princess
mary
entering
such
moment
would
say
little
nicholas
can
out
today
very
cold
were
hot
prince
andrew
would
reply
such
times
very
dryly
his
sister
could
out
his
smock
but
cold
must
wear
warm
clothes
which
were
designed
for
that
purpose
that
what
follows
from
the
fact
that
cold
and
not
that
child
who
needs
fresh
air
should
remain
home
would
add
with
extreme
logic
punishing
someone
for
those
secret
illogical
emotions
that
stirred
within
him
such
moments
princess
mary
would
think
how
intellectual
work
dries
men
chapter
prince
andrew
arrived
petersburg
august
was
the
time
when
the
youthful
speranski
was
the
zenith
his
fame
and
his
reforms
were
being
pushed
forward
with
the
greatest
energy
that
same
august
the
emperor
was
thrown
from
his
caleche
injured
his
leg
and
remained
three
weeks
peterhof
receiving
speranski
every
day
and
one
else
that
time
the
two
famous
decrees
were
being
prepared
that
agitated
society
abolishing
court
ranks
and
introducing
examinations
qualify
for
the
grades
collegiate
assessor
and
state

and
not
merely
these
but

state
constitution
intended
change
the
existing
order
government
russia
legal
administrative
and
financial
from
the
council
state
down
the
district

now
those
vague
liberal
dreams
with
which
the
emperor
alexander
had
ascended
the
throne
and
which
had
tried
put
into
effect
with
the
aid
his
associates
czartoryski
novosiltsev
kochubey
and
strogonov
whom
himself
jest
had
called
his
comite

were
taking
shape
and
being
realized
now
all
these
men
were
replaced

after
his

presented
himself

and

the
emperor
though
met
him
twice
did
not
favor
him
with
single
word
had
always
seemed
prince
andrew
before
that
was
antipathetic
the
emperor
and
that
the
latter
disliked
his
face
and
personality
generally
and
the
cold
repellent
glance
the
emperor
gave
him
now
found

suddenly
the

was
heard
from

side

and
the
officer
with
pale
face
and
trembling
lips
came
out
and
passed
through
the

this
movement
reconstruction
which
prince
andrew
had
vague

its
chief
promoter
began
interest
him
keenly

his
consciousness
prince
andrew
was
most
favorably
placed

good
reception
the
highest
and
most
diverse
petersburg
circles
the
day
the
reforming
party
cordially
welcomed
and
courted
him
the
first
place
because
was
reputed
clever
and
very
well
read
and
secondly
because
liberating
his
serfs
had
obtained
the
reputation
being
liberal
the
party
the
old
and
dissatisfied
who
censured
the
innovations
turned
him
expecting
his
sympathy
their
disapproval
the
reforms
simply
because
was
the
son
his
father
the
feminine
society
world
welcomed
him
gladly
because

and
almost
newcomer

had
known

greatly
improved
during
these
last
five
years
having
softened
and
grown
more
manly

his
former
affectation

and
contemptuous
irony

easily
recognizable
the
society

never
seen
anyone
who
together
with
awkward
and
clumsy
gestures
possessed
such
calmness
and
self
assurance

involuntarily
entering
large
company
and
was
hurry

spoke
slowly
with
assurance
that
would
listened
and
looked
only
the
person
with
whom
was
conversing
prince
andrew
followed
speranski
every
word
and
movement
with
particular
attention
happens
some
people
especially
men
who
judge
those
near
them
severely
always
meeting
anyone
new
especially
anyone
whom
like
speranski
knew

him
the

been
unable

sooner
had
been
detained
the
palace
did
not
say
that
the
emperor
had
kept
him
and
prince
andrew
noticed
this
affectation
modesty
when
kochubey
introduced
prince
andrew
speranski
slowly
turned
his
eyes
bolkonski
with
his
customary
smile
and
looked
him
silence
very
glad
make
your
acquaintance
had
heard
you
everyone
has
said
after
pause
kochubey
said
few
words
about
the
reception
arakcheev
had
given
bolkonski
speranski
smiled
more
markedly
the
chairman
the
committee
army
regulations
good
friend
monsieur
magnitski
said
fully
articulating
every
word
and
syllable
and
you
like
can
put
you
touch
with
him
paused
the
full
stop
hope
you
will
find
him
sympathetic
and
ready
operate
promoting
all
that
reasonable
circle
soon
formed
round
speranski
and
the
old
man
who
had
talked
about
his
subordinate
pryanichnikov
addressed
question
him
prince
andrew
without
joining
the
conversation
watched
every
movement
speranski
this
man
not
long
since
insignificant
divinity
student
who
now
bolkonski
thought
held
his
hands
those
plump
white
hands
the
fate
russia
prince
andrew
was
struck
the
extraordinarily
disdainful
composure
with
which
speranski
answered
the
old
man
appeared
address
condescending
words
him
from
immeasurable
height
when
the
old
man
began
speak
too
loud
speranski
smiled
and
said
could
not
judge
the
advantage
disadvantage
what
pleased
the
sovereign
having
talked
for
little
while
the
general
circle
speranski
rose
and
coming
prince
andrew
took
him
along
the
other
end
the
room
was
clear
that
thought
necessary
interest
himself
bolkonski
had
chance
talk
with
you
prince
during
the
animated
conversation
which
that
venerable
gentleman
involved
said
with
mildly
contemptuous
smile
intimating
that
smile
that
and
prince
andrew
understood
the
insignificance
the
people
with
whom
had
just
been
talking
this
flattered
prince
andrew
have
known
you
for
long
time
first
from
your
action
with
regard
your
serfs
first
example
which
very
desirable
that
there
should
more
imitators
and
secondly
because
you
are
one
those
gentlemen
the
chamber
who
have
not
considered
themselves
offended
the
new
decree
concerning
the
ranks
allotted
courtiers
which
causing
much
gossip
and
tittle
tattle
said
prince
andrew
father
did
not
wish
take
advantage
the
privilege
began
the
service
from
the
lower
grade
your
father
man
the
last
century
evidently
stands
above
our
contemporaries
who
condemn
this
measure
which
merely
reestablishes
natural
justice
think
however
that
these
condemnations
have
some
ground
returned
prince
andrew
trying
resist
speranski
influence
which
began
conscious
did
not
like
agree
with
him
everything
and
felt
wish
contradict
though
usually
spoke
easily
and
well
felt
difficulty
expressing
himself
now
while
talking
with
speranski
was
too
much
absorbed
observing
the
famous
man
personality
grounds
personal
ambition
maybe
speranski
put
quietly
and
state
interest
some
extent
said
prince
andrew
what
you
mean
asked
speranski
quietly
lowering
his
eyes
admirer

prince

maintaining
that

the

vanished
from

was
much
improved

and

the

speranski
went

the
pleasure
more

with
you
closing
his
eyes
bowed
francaise
without
taking
leave
and
trying
attract
little
attention
possible
left
the
room
chapter
during
the
first
weeks
his
stay
petersburg
prince
andrew
felt
the
whole
trend
thought
had
formed
during
his
life
seclusion
quite
overshadowed
the
trifling
cares
that
engrossed
him
that
city
returning
home
the
evening
would
jot
down
his
notebook
four
five
necessary
calls
appointments
for
certain
hours
the
mechanism
life
the
arrangement
the
day
time
everywhere
absorbed
the
greater
part
his
vital
energy
did
nothing
did
not
even
think
find
time
think
but
only
talked
and
talked
successfully
what
had
thought
while
the
country
sometimes
noticed
with
dissatisfaction
that
repeated
the
same
remark
the
same
day
different
circles
but
was
busy
for
whole
days
together
that
had
time
notice
that
was
thinking
nothing
had
done
their
first
meeting
kochubey
speranski
produced
strong
impression
prince
andrew
the
wednesday
when
received
him
tête
tête
his
own
house
and
talked
him
long
and
confidentially
bolkonski
many
people
appeared
contemptible
and
insignificant
creatures
and
longed
find
someone
the
living
ideal
that
perfection
toward
which
strove
that
readily
believed
that
speranski
had
found
this
ideal
perfectly
rational
and
virtuous
man
had
speranski
sprung
from
the
same
class
himself
and
possessed
the
same
breeding
and
traditions
bolkonski
would
soon
have
discovered
his
weak
human
unheroic
sides
but
was
speranski
strange
and
logical
turn
mind
inspired
him
with
respect
all
the
more
because
did
not
quite
understand
him
moreover
speranski
either
because
appreciated
the
other
capacity
because
considered
necessary
win
him
his
side
showed
off
his
dispassionate
calm
reasonableness
before
prince
andrew
and
flattered
him
with
that
subtle
flattery
which
goes
hand
hand
with
self
assurance
and
consists
tacit
assumption
that
one
companion
the
only
man
besides
oneself
capable
understanding
the
folly
the
rest
mankind
and
the
reasonableness
and
profundity
one
own
ideas
during
their
long
conversation
wednesday
evening
speranski
more
than
once
remarked
regard
everything
that
above
the
common
level
rooted
custom
with
smile
but
want
the
wolves
fed
and
the
sheep
safe
they
cannot
understand
this
and
all
way
that
seemed
say
you
and
understand
what
they
are
and
who
are
this
first
long
conversation
with
speranski
only
strengthened
prince
andrew
the
feeling
had
experienced
toward
him
their
first
meeting
saw
him
remarkable
clear
thinking
man
vast
intellect
who
his
energy
and
persistence
had
attained
power
which
was
using
solely
for
the
welfare
russia
prince
andrew
eyes
speranski
was
the
man
would
himself
have
wished
one
who
explained
all
the
facts
life
reasonably
considered
important
only
what
was
rational
and
was
capable
applying
the
standard
reason
everything
everything
seemed
simple
and
clear
speranski
exposition
that
prince
andrew
involuntarily
agreed
with
him
about
everything
replied
and
argued
was
only
because
wished
maintain
his
independence
and
not
submit
speranski
opinions
entirely
everything
was
right
and
everything
was
should
only
one
thing
disconcerted
prince
andrew
this
was
speranski
cold
mirrorlike
look
which
did
not
allow
one
penetrate
his
soul
and
his
delicate
white
hands
which
prince
andrew
involuntarily
watched
one
does
watch
the
hands
those
who
possess
power
this
mirrorlike
gaze
and
those
delicate
hands
irritated
prince
andrew
knew
not
why
was
unpleasantly
struck
too
the
excessive
contempt
for
others
that
observed
speranski
and
the
diversity
lines
argument
used
support
his
opinions
made
use
every
kind
mental
device
except
analogy
and
passed
too
boldly
seemed
prince
andrew
from
one
another
now
would
take
the
position
practical
man
and
condemn
dreamers
now
that
satirist
and
laugh
ironically
his
opponents
now
grow
severely
logical
suddenly
rise
the
realm
metaphysics
this
last
resource
was
one
very
frequently
employed
would
transfer
question
metaphysical
heights
pass
definitions
space
time
and
thought
and
having
deduced
the
refutation
needed
would
again
descend
the
level
the
original
discussion
general
the
trait
speranski
mentality
which
struck
prince
andrew
most
was
his
absolute
and
unshakable
belief
the
power
and
authority
reason
was
evident
that
the
thought
could
never
occur
him
which
prince
andrew
seemed
natural
namely
that
after
all
impossible
express
all
one
thinks
and
that
had
never
felt
the
doubt
not
all
think
and
believe
nonsense
and
was
just
this
peculiarity
speranski
mind
that
particularly
attracted
prince
andrew
during
the
first
period
their
acquaintance
bolkonski
felt
passionate
admiration
for
him
similar
that
which
had
once
felt
for
bonaparte
the
fact
that
speranski
was
the
son
village
priest
and
that
stupid
people
might
meanly
despise
him
account
his
humble
origin
fact
many
did
caused
prince
andrew
cherish
his
sentiment
for
him
the
more
and
unconsciously
strengthen
that
first
evening
bolkonski
spent
with
him
having
mentioned
the
commission
for
the
revision
the
code
laws
speranski
told
him
sarcastically
that
the
commission
had
existed
for
hundred
and
fifty
years
had
cost
millions
and
had
done
nothing
except
that
rosenkampf
had
stuck
labels
the
corresponding
paragraphs
the
different
codes
and
that
all
the
state
has
for
the
millions
has
spent
said
want
give
the
senate
new
juridical
powers
but
have
laws
that
why
sin
for
men
like
you
prince
not
serve
these
times
prince
andrew
said
that
for
that
work
education
jurisprudence
was
needed
which
did
not
possess
but
nobody
possesses
what
would
you
have
vicious
circle
from
which
must
break
way
out
week
later
prince
andrew
was
member
the
committee
army
regulations
and
what
had
not
all
expected
was
chairman
section
the
committee
for
the
revision
the
laws
speranski
request
took
the
first
part
the
civil
code
that
was
being
drawn
and
with
the
aid
the
code
napoleon
and
the
institutes
justinian
worked
formulating
the
section
personal
rights
chapter
vii
nearly
two
years
before
this
pierre
returning
petersburg
after
visiting
his
estates
had
involuntarily
found
himself
leading
position
among
the
petersburg
freemasons
arranged
dining
and
funeral
lodge
meetings
enrolled
new
members
and
busied
himself
uniting
various
lodges
and
acquiring
authentic
charters
gave
money
for
the
erection
temples
and
supplemented
far
could
the
collection
alms
regard
which
the
majority
members
were
stingy
and
irregular
supported
almost
singlehanded
poorhouse
the
order
had
founded
petersburg
his
life
meanwhile
continued
before
with
the
same
infatuations
and
dissipations
liked
dine
and
drink
well
and
though
considered
immoral
and
humiliating
could
not
resist
the
temptations
the
bachelor
circles
which
moved
amid
the
turmoil
his
activities
and
distractions
however
pierre
the
end
year
began
feel
that
the
more
firmly
tried
rest
upon
the
more
masonic
ground
which
stood
gave
way
under
him
the
same
time
felt
that
the
deeper
the
ground
sank
under
him
the
closer
bound
involuntarily
became
the
order
when
had
joined
the
freemasons
had
experienced
the
feeling
one
who
confidently
steps
onto
the
smooth
surface
bog
when
put
his
foot
down
sank
make
quite
sure
the
firmness
the
ground
put
his
other
foot
down
and
sank
deeper
still
became
stuck
and
involuntarily
waded
knee
deep
the
bog
joseph
alexeevich
was
not
petersburg
had
late
stood
aside
from
the
affairs
the
petersburg
lodges
and
lived
almost
entirely
moscow
all
the
members
the
lodges
were
men
pierre
knew
ordinary
life
and
was
difficult
for
him
regard
them
merely
brothers
freemasonry
and
not
prince
ivan
vasilevich
whom
knew
society
mostly
weak
and
insignificant
men
under
the
masonic
aprons
and
insignia
saw
the
uniforms
and
decorations
which
they
aimed
ordinary
life
often
after
collecting
alms
and
reckoning
twenty
thirty
rubles
received
for
the
most
part
promises
from
dozen
members
whom
half
were
well
able
pay
himself
pierre
remembered
the
masonic
vow
which
each
brother
promised
devote
all
his
belongings
his
neighbor
and
doubts
which
tried
not
dwell
arose
his
soul
divided
the
brothers
knew
into
four
categories
the
first
put
those
who
did
not
take
active
part
the
affairs
the
lodges
human
affairs
but
were
exclusively
occupied
with
the
mystical
science
the
order
with
questions
the

this

which
the

ones
chiefly
belonged
including
pierre
thought
joseph
alexeevich
himself
but
did
not

their

his
heart
was
not
the

freemasonry
the

pierre
reckoned
himself
and
others
like
him
seeking
and
vacillating
who
had
not
yet
found
freemasonry
straight
and
comprehensible
path
but
hoped
the
third
category
included
those
brothers
the
majority
who
saw
nothing
freemasonry
but
the
external
forms
and
ceremonies
and
prized
the
strict
performance
these
forms
without
troubling
about
their

such
were
willarski
and
even
the

the

finally
the
fourth
category
also
great
many
brothers
belonged
particularly
those
who
had
lately
joined
these
according
pierre
observations
were
men
who
had
belief
anything
nor
desire
for
anything
but
joined
the
freemasons
merely
associate
with
the
wealthy
young
brothers
who
were
influential
through
their
connections
rank
and
whom
there
were
very
many
the
lodge
pierre
began
feel
dissatisfied
with
what
was
doing
freemasonry
any
rate
saw
here
sometimes
seemed
him
based
merely
externals
did
not
think
doubting
freemasonry
itself
but
suspected
that
russian
masonry
had
taken
wrong
path
and
deviated
from
its
original
principles
and
toward
the
end
the
year
went
abroad
initiated
into
the
higher
secrets
the

the
summer
pierre
returned

our
freemasons
knew
from

with

abroad
that
bezukhov
had
obtained
the
confidence
many
highly
placed
persons
had
been
initiated
into
many

had
been
raised

was
bringing

much
that

russia
the
petersburg
freemasons
all
came
see
him
tried
ingratiate
themselves
with
him
and
seemed
them
all
that
was
preparing
something
for
them
and
concealing
solemn
meeting
the
lodge
the
second
degree
was
convened
which
pierre
promised
communicate
the
petersburg
brothers
what
had
deliver
them
from
the
highest
leaders
their

the
meeting
was
full
one
after
the
usual
ceremonies
pierre
rose
and
began
his
address
dear

began
blushing
and
stammering
with
written
speech
his

not

raised
his

and
began
read

must

virtue
over

and
must
endeavor
secure
that
the
honest
man
may
even
this
world
receive
lasting
reward
for
his
virtue
but
these
great
endeavors
are
gravely
hampered
the
political
institutions
today
what
done
these
circumstances
favor
revolutions
overthrow
everything
repel
force
force
are
very
far
from
that
every
violent
reform
deserves
censure
for
quite
fails
remedy
evil
while
men
remain
what
they
are
and
also
because
wisdom
needs
violence
the
whole
plan
our
order
should
based
the
idea
preparing
men
firmness
and
virtue
bound
together
unity
conviction
aiming
the
punishment
vice
and
folly
and
patronizing
talent
and
virtue
raising
worthy
men
from
the
dust
and
attaching
them
our
brotherhood
only
then
will
our
order
have
the
power
unobtrusively
bind
the
hands
the
protectors
disorder
and
control
them
without
their
being
aware
word
must
found
form
government
holding
universal
sway
which
should
diffused
over
the
whole
world
without
destroying
the
bonds
citizenship
and
beside
which
all
other
governments
can
continue
their
customary
course
and
everything
except
what
impedes
the
great
aim
our
order
which
obtain
for
virtue
the
victory
over
vice
this
aim
was
that
christianity
itself
taught
men
wise
and
good
and
for
their
own
benefit
follow
the
example
and
instruction
the
best
and
wisest
men
that
time
when
everything
was
plunged
darkness
preaching
alone
was
course
sufficient
the
novelty
truth
endowed
her
with
special
strength
but
now
need
much
more
powerful
methods
now
necessary
that
man
governed
his
senses
should
find
virtue
charm
palpable
those
senses
impossible
eradicate
the
passions
but
must
strive
direct
them
noble
aim
and
therefore
necessary
that
everyone
should
able
satisfy
his
passions
within
the
limits
virtue
our
order
should
provide
means
that
end
soon
have
certain
number
worthy
men
every
state
each
them
again
training
two
others
and
all
being
closely
united
everything
will
possible
for
our
order
which
has
already
secret
accomplished
much
for
the
welfare
mankind
this
speech
not
only
made
strong
impression
but
created
excitement
the
lodge
the
majority
the
brothers
seeing
dangerous
designs
illuminism
met
with
coldness
that
surprised
pierre
the
grand
master
began
answering
him
and
pierre
began
developing
his
views
with
more
and
more
warmth
was
long
since
there
had
been
stormy
meeting
parties
were
formed
some
accusing
pierre
illuminism
others
supporting
him
that
meeting
was
struck
for
the
first
time
the
endless
variety
men
minds
which
prevents
truth
from
ever
presenting
itself
identically
two
persons
even
those
members
who
seemed
his
side
understood
him
their
own
way
with
limitations
and
alterations
could
not
agree
what
always
wanted
most
was
convey
his
thought
others
just
himself
understood
the
illuminati
sought
substitute
republican
for
monarchical
institutions
the
end
the
meeting
the
grand
master
with
irony
and
ill
will
reproved
bezukhov
for
his
vehemence
and
said
was
not
love
virtue
alone
but
also
love
strife
that
had
moved
him
the
dispute
pierre
did
not
answer
him
and
asked
briefly
whether
his
proposal
would
accepted
was
told
that
would
not
and
without
waiting
for
the
usual
formalities
left
the
lodge
and
went
home
chapter
viii
again
pierre
was
overtaken
the
depression
dreaded
for
three
days
after
the
delivery
his
speech
the
lodge
lay
sofa
home
receiving
one
and
going
nowhere
was
just
then
that
received
letter
from
his
wife
who
implored
him
see
her
telling
him
how
grieved
she
was
about
him
and
how
she
wished
devote
her
whole
life
him
the
end
the
letter
she
informed
him
that
few
days
she
would
return
petersburg
from
abroad
following
this
letter
one
the
masonic
brothers
whom
pierre
respected
less
than
the
others
forced
his
way
see
him
and
turning
the
conversation
upon
pierre
matrimonial
affairs
way
fraternal
advice
expressed
the
opinion
that
his
severity
his
wife
was
wrong
and
that
was
neglecting
one
the
first
rules
freemasonry
not
forgiving
the
penitent
the
same
time
his
mother
law
prince
vasili
wife
sent
him
imploring
him
come
only
for
few
minutes
discuss
most
important
matter
pierre
saw
that
there
was
conspiracy
against
him
and
that
they
wanted
reunite
him
with
his
wife
and
the
mood
then
was
this
was
not
even
unpleasant
him
nothing
mattered
him
nothing
life
seemed
him
much
importance
and
under
the
influence
the
depression
that
possessed
him
valued
neither
his
liberty
nor
his
resolution
punish
his
wife
one
right
and
one
blame
she
too
not
blame
thought
did
not
once
give
his
consent
reunion
with
his
wife
was
only
because
his
state
depression
did
not
feel
able
take
any
step
had
his
wife
come
him
would
not
have
turned
her
away
compared
what
preoccupied
him
was
not
matter
indifference
whether
lived
with
his
wife
not
without
replying
either
his
wife
his
mother
law
pierre
late
one
night
prepared
for
journey
and
started
for
moscow
see
joseph
alexeevich
this
what
noted
his
diary
moscow
november
have
just
returned
from
benefactor
and
hasten
write
down
what
have
experienced
joseph
alexeevich
living
poorly
and
has
for
three
years
been
suffering
from
painful
disease
the
bladder
one
has
ever
heard
him
utter
groan
word
complaint
from
morning
till
late
night
except
when
eats
his
very
plain
food
working
science
received
graciously
and
made
sit
down
the
bed
which
lay
made
the
sign
the
knights
the
east
and
jerusalem
and
responded
the
same
manner
asking
with
mild
smile
what
had
learned
and
gained
the
prussian
and
scottish
lodges
told
him
everything
best
could
and
told
him
what
had
proposed
our
petersburg
lodge
the
bad
reception
had
encountered
and
rupture
with
the
brothers
joseph
alexeevich
having
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
for
good
while
told
his
view
the
matter
which
once
lit
for
whole
past
and
the
future
path
should
follow
surprised
asking
whether
remembered
the
threefold
aim
the
order
the
preservation
and
study
the
mystery
the
purification
and
reformation
oneself
for
its
reception
and
the
improvement
the
human
race
striving
for
such
purification
which
the
principal
aim
these
three
certainly
self
reformation
and
self
purification
only
this
aim
can
always
strive
independently
circumstances
but
the
same
time
just
this
aim
demands
the
greatest
efforts
and
led
astray
pride
losing
sight
this
aim
occupy
ourselves
either
with
the
mystery
which
our
impurity
are
unworthy
receive
seek
the
reformation
the
human
race
while
ourselves
setting
example
baseness
and
profligacy
illuminism
not
pure
doctrine
just
because
attracted
social
activity
and
puffed
pride
this
ground
joseph
alexeevich
condemned
speech
and
whole
activity
and
the
depth
soul
agreed
with
him
talking
family
affairs
said
the
chief
duty
true
mason
have
told
you
lies
perfecting
himself
often
think
that
removing
all
the
difficulties
our
life
shall
more
quickly
reach
our
aim
but
the
contrary
dear
sir
only
the
midst
worldly
cares
that
can
attain
our
three
chief
aims
self
knowledge
for
man
can
only
know
himself
comparison
self
perfecting
which
can
only
attained
conflict
and
the
attainment
the
chief
virtue
love
death
only
the
vicissitudes
life
can
show
its
vanity
and
develop
our
innate
love
death
rebirth
new
life
these
words
are
all
the
more
remarkable
because
spite
his
great
physical
sufferings
joseph
alexeevich
never
weary
life
though
loves
death
for
which
spite
the
purity
and
loftiness
his
inner
man
does
not
yet
feel
himself
sufficiently
prepared
benefactor
then
explained
fully
the
meaning
the
great
square
creation
and
pointed
out
that
the
numbers
three
and
seven
are
the
basis
everything
advised
not
avoid
intercourse
with
the
petersburg
brothers
but
take
only
second
grade
posts
the
lodge
try
while
diverting
the
brothers
from
pride
turn
them
toward
the
true
path
self
knowledge
and
self
perfecting
besides
this
advised
for
myself
personally
above
all
keep
watch
over
myself
and
that
end
gave
notebook
the
one
now
writing
and
which
will
future
note
down
all
actions

again
living
with
wife
mother

came
tears
and
said
that
helene
was
here
and
that
she
implored
hear
her
that
she
was
innocent
and
unhappy
desertion
and
much
more
knew
that
once
let
myself
see
her
should
not
have
strength
refusing
what
she
wanted
perplexity
did
not
know
whose
aid
and
advice
seek
had
benefactor
been
here
would
have
told
what
went
room
and
reread
joseph
alexeevich
letters
and
recalled
conversations
with
him
and
deduced
from
all
that
ought
not
refuse
supplicant
and
ought
reach
helping
hand
everyone
especially
one
closely
bound
and
that
must
bear
cross
but
forgive
her
for
the
sake
doing
right
then
let
union
with
her
have
only
spiritual
aim
that
what
decided
and
what
wrote
joseph
alexeevich
told
wife
that
begged
her
forget
the
past
forgive
whatever
wrong
may
have
done
her
and
that
had
nothing
forgive
gave
joy
tell
her
this
she
need
not
know
how
hard
was
for
see
her
again
have
settled
the
upper
floor
this
big
house

experiencing
happy
feeling
regeneration
chapter
that

the
highest
society
that
met

and
the
grand

was
divided
into
several
circles
each
with
its

these
was
the

the

belonging

noted
for
their
intellect
and
polished
manners

had
brought

not

for
she
had
become
even
handsomer
than
before
what
did
surprise
him
was
that
during

last
two
years
his

succeeded
gaining
the

way

pierre
who
knew
she
was
very
stupid
sometimes
attended
with
strange
feeling
perplexity
and
fear
her
evenings
and
dinner
parties
where
politics
poetry
and
philosophy
were
discussed
these
parties
his
feelings
were
like
those
conjuror
who
always
expects
his
trick
found
out
any
moment
but
whether
because
stupidity
was
just
what
was
needed
run

found
pleasure

deception

raptures
over
every
word
hers

for

she

from
spoiling

regardless
whether
any

not
lispingly
expressed
his
views
which
were
sometimes
not
all
accord
with
the

but
the
general
opinion
concerning
the
queer
husband
the
most
distinguished
woman

was
well
established
that

took
his

seriously

treated
him
like

her
smile
for
him
was
the

sometimes
that

uncomfortable

painfully
three

from

yielding

read
the

but
without
proper
feeling
brother
urusov
came
and
talked
about
worldly
vanities
told
the
emperor
new
projects
began
criticize
them
but
remembered
rules
and
benefactor
words
that
true
freemason
should
zealous
worker
for
the
state
when
his
aid
required
and
quiet
onlooker
when
not
called
assist

and
visited
and
had
preliminary
talk
about
the
reception
new
brother
they
laid
the
duty
rhetor
feel
myself
weak
and
unworthy
then
our
talk
turned
the
interpretation
the
seven
pillars
and

the
seven

the
seven
virtues
the
seven
vices
and
the
seven

brother
was
very
eloquent
the
evening
the
admission
took
place
the
new
decoration
the
premises
contributed
much
the
magnificence
the
spectacle
was
boris
drubetskoy
who
was
admitted
nominated
him
and
was
the
rhetor
strange
feeling
agitated
all
the
time
was
alone
with
him
the
dark
chamber
caught
myself
harboring
feeling
hatred
toward
him
which
vainly
tried
overcome
that
why
should
really
like
save
him
from
evil
and
lead
him
into
the
path
truth
but
evil
thoughts
him
did
not
leave
seemed
that
his
object
entering
the
brotherhood
was
merely
intimate
and
favor
with
members
our
lodge
apart
from
the
fact
that
had
asked
several
times
whether
and
were
members
our
lodge
question
which
could
not
reply
and
that
according
observation
incapable
feeling
respect
for
our
holy
order
and
too
preoccupied
and
satisfied
with
the
outer
man
desire
spiritual
improvement
had
cause
doubt
him
but
seemed
insincere
and
all
the
time
stood
alone
with
him
the
dark
temple
seemed
that
was
smiling
contemptuously
words
and
wished
really
stab
his
bare
breast
with
the
sword
held

not
eloquent
nor
could

december
awoke

but
was
apathetic
afterwards
went
and
paced
and
down
the
large
hall
wished

but
instead
imagination
pictured
occurrence
four
years
ago
when
dolokhov
meeting
moscow
after
our

said

was
enjoying
perfect
peace
mind
spite
wife
absence
the
time
gave
him
answer
now
recalled
every
detail
that
meeting
and
mind
gave
him
the
most
malevolent
and
bitter
replies
recollected
myself
and
drove
away
that
thought
only
when
found
myself
glowing
with
anger
but
did
not
sufficiently
repent
afterwards
boris
drubetskoy
came
and
began
relating
various
adventures
his
coming
vexed
from
the
first
and
said
something
disagreeable
him
replied
flared
and
said
much
that
was
unpleasant
and
even
rude
him
became
silent
and
recollected
myself
only
when
was
too
late
god
cannot
get
with
him
all
the
cause
this
egotism
set
myself
above
him
and
become
much
worse
than
for
lenient
rudeness
while
the
contrary
nourish
contempt
for
him
god
grant
that
his
presence
may
rather
see
own
vileness
and
behave
that
too
may
benefit
after
dinner
fell
asleep
and
was
drowsing
off
clearly
heard
voice
saying

that

scarcely

before
another
bigger
one
began
biting
lifted
but
the
higher
lifted
the
bigger
and
heavier
grew
and
suddenly
brother
came
and
taking
arm
led
building
enter
which
had
pass
along
narrow
plank
stepped
but
bent
and
gave
way
and
began
clamber
fence
which
could
scarcely
reach
with
hands
after
much
effort
dragged
myself
that
leg
hung
down
one
side
and
body
the
other
looked
round
and
saw
brother
standing
the
fence
and
pointing
broad
avenue
and
garden
and
the
garden
was
large
and
beautiful
building
woke

december
dreamed
that
joseph
alexeevich
was
sitting
house
and
that
was
very
glad
and
wished
entertain
him
seemed
chattered
incessantly
with
other
people
and
suddenly
remembered
that
this
could
not
please
him
and
wished
come
close
him
and
embrace
him
but
soon
drew
near
saw
that
his
face
had
changed
and
grown
young
and
was
quietly
telling
something
about
the
teaching
our
order
but
softly
that
could
not
hear
then
seemed
that
all
left
the
room
and
something
strange
happened
were
sitting
lying
the
floor
was
telling
something
and
wished
show
him
sensibility
and
not
listening
what
was
saying
began
picturing
myself
the
condition
inner
man
and
the
grace
god
sanctifying
and
tears
came
into
eyes
and
was
glad
noticed
this
but
looked
with
vexation
and
jumped
breaking
off
his
remarks
felt
abashed
and
asked
whether
what
had
been
saying
did
not
concern
but
did
not
reply
gave
kind
look
and
then
suddenly
found
ourselves
bedroom
where
there
double
bed
lay
down
the
edge
and
burned
with
longing
caress
him
and
lie
down
too
and
said
tell
frankly
what
your
chief
temptation
you
know
think
you
know
already
abashed
this
question
replied
that
sloth
was
chief
temptation
shook
his
head
incredulously
and
even
more
abashed
said
that
though
was
living
with
wife
advised
was
not
living
with
her
her
husband
this
replied
that
one
should
not
deprive
wife
one
embraces
and
gave
understand
that
that
was
duty
but
replied
that
should
ashamed
and
suddenly
everything
vanished
and
awoke
and
found
mind
the
text
from
the
gospel
the
life
was
the
light

and
the
light
shineth
darkness
and
the
darkness
comprehended

taken
place

and
kissed

hands
and
said

saw
that
his
face

said

that

berg
had
pointed
out
vera

him
and
had
said
german
das

and
from
that
moment
had
made
his
mind
marry
her
now
petersburg
having
considered
the
rostovs
position
and
his
own
decided
that
the
time
had
come
propose
that
girl
shall
wife
berg
proposal
was
first
received
with
perplexity
that
was
not
flattering
him
first
seemed
strange
that
the
son
obscure
livonian
gentleman
should
propose
marriage
countess
rostova
but
berg
chief
characteristic
was
such
naive
and
good
natured
egotism
that
the
rostovs
involuntarily
came
think
would
good
thing
since
himself
was
firmly
convinced
that
was
good
indeed
excellent
moreover
the
rostovs
affairs
were
seriously
embarrassed
the
suitor
could
not
but
know
and
above
all
vera
was
twenty
four
had
been
taken
out
everywhere
and
though
she
was
certainly
good
looking
and
sensible
one
now
had
proposed
her
they
gave
their
consent
you
see
said
berg
his
comrade
whom
called
friend
only
because
knew
that
everyone
has
friends
you
see
have
considered
all
and
should
not
marry
had
not
thought
all
out
were
any
way
unsuitable
but
the
contrary
papa
and
mamma
are
now
provided
for
have
arranged
that
rent
for
them
the
baltic
provinces
and
can
live
petersburg
pay
and
with
her
fortune
and
good
management
can
get
along
nicely
not
marrying
for
money
consider
that
dishonorable
but
wife
should
bring
her
share
and
husband
his
have
position
the
service
she
has
connections
and
some
means

above
all
she
handsome
estimable

and
she

blushed
and
smiled
and
love
her
because
her
character
sensible
and
very
good
now
the
other

though
they
are
the

was
going

but
changed
his
mind
and
said
take
tea
with
and
quickly
doubling
his
tongue
blew
small
round
ring
tobacco
smoke
perfectly
embodying
his
dream
happiness
after
the
first
feeling
perplexity
aroused
the
parents
berg
proposal
the
holiday
tone
joyousness
usual
such
times
took
possession
the
family
but
the
rejoicing
was
external
and
insincere
the
family
feeling
toward
this
wedding
certain
awkwardness
and
constraint
was
evident
they
were
ashamed
not
having
loved
vera
sufficiently
and
being
ready
get
her
off
their
hands
the
old
count
felt
this
most
would
probably
have
been
unable
state
the
cause
his
embarrassment
but
resulted
from
the
state
his
affairs
did
not
know
all
how
much
had
what
his
debts
amounted
what
dowry
could
give
vera
when
his
daughters
were
born
had
assigned
each
them
for
her
dowry
estate
with
three
hundred
serfs
but
one
these
estates
had
already
been
sold
and
the
other
was
mortgaged
and
the
interest
much
arrears
that
would
have
sold
that
was
impossible
give
vera
nor
had
any
money
berg
had
already
been
engaged
month
and
only
week
remained
before
the
wedding
but
the
count
had
not
yet
decided
his
own
mind
the
question
the
dowry
nor
spoken
his
wife
about
one
time
the
count
thought
giving
her
the
ryazan
estate
selling
forest
another
time
borrowing
money
note
hand
few
days
before
the
wedding
berg
entered
the
count
study
early
one
morning
and
with
pleasant
smile
respectfully
asked
his
future
father
law
let
him
know
what
vera
dowry
would
the
count
was
disconcerted
this
long
foreseen
inquiry
that
without
consideration
gave
the
first
reply
that
came
into
his
head
like
your
being
businesslike
about
like
you
shall
satisfied
and
patting
berg
the
shoulder
got
wishing
end
the
conversation
but
berg
smiling
pleasantly
explained
that
did
not
know
for
certain
how
much
vera
would
have
and
did
not
receive
least
part
the
dowry
advance
would
have
break
matters
off
because
consider
count
allowed
myself
marry
now
without
having
definite
means
maintain
wife
should
acting
badly
the
conversation
ended
the
count
who
wished
generous
and
avoid
further
importunity
saying
that
would
give
note
hand
for
eighty
thousand
rubles
berg
smiled
meekly
kissed
the
count
the
shoulder
and
said
that
was
very
grateful
but
that
was
impossible
for
him
arrange
his
new
life
without
receiving
thirty
thousand
ready
money
least
twenty
thousand
count
added
and
then
note
hand
for
only
sixty
thousand
yes
yes
all
right
said
the
count
hurriedly
only
excuse
dear
fellow
give
you
twenty
thousand
and
note

for
eighty

well
yes
yes

natasha
was
sixteen
and
was
the
year
the
very
year
which
she
had
counted
her
fingers
with
boris
after
they
had
kissed
four
years
ago
since
then
she
had
not
seen
him
before
sonya
and
her
mother
boris
happened
mentioned
she
spoke
quite
freely
that
episode
some
childish
long
forgotten
matter
that
was
not
worth
mentioning
but
the
secret
depths
her
soul
the
question
whether
her
engagement
boris
was
jest
important
binding
promise
tormented
her
since
boris
left
moscow
join
the
army
had
not
seen
the
rostovs
had
been
moscow
several
times
and
had
passed
near
otradnoe
but
had
never
been
see
them
sometimes
occurred
natasha
that
did
not
wish
see
her
and
this
conjecture
was
confirmed
the
sad
tone
which
her
elders
spoke
him
nowadays
old
friends

say
when
boris
was
mentioned

had
late
visited
them
less
frequently
seemed
hold
herself
with
particular
dignity
and
always
spoke
rapturously
and
gratefully
the
merits
her
son
and
the
brilliant
career
which
had
entered
when
the
rostovs
came
petersburg
boris
called
them
drove
their
house
some
agitation
the
memory
natasha
was
his
most
poetic
recollection
but
went
with
the
firm
intention
letting
her
and
her
parents
feel
that
the
childish
relations
between
himself
and
natasha
could
not
binding
either
her
him
had
brilliant
position

thanks
his
intimacy
with
countess
bezukhova
brilliant
position
the
service
thanks
the
patronage
important
personage
whose
complete
confidence
enjoyed
and
was
beginning
make
plans
for
marrying
one
the
richest
heiresses
petersburg
plans
which
might
very
easily
realized
when
entered
the
rostovs
drawing
room
natasha
was
her
own
room
when
she
heard
his
arrival
she
almost
ran
into
the
drawing
room
flushed
and
beaming
with
more
than
cordial
smile
boris
remembered
natasha
short
dress
with
dark
eyes
shining
from
under
her
curls
and
boisterous
childish
laughter
had
known
her
four
years
before
and
was
taken
aback
when
quite
different
natasha
entered
and
his
face
expressed
rapturous
astonishment
this
expression
his
face
pleased
natasha
well
you
recognize
your
little
madcap
playmate
asked
the
countess
boris
kissed
natasha
hand
and
said
that
was
astonished
the
change
her
how
handsome
you
have
grown
should
think
replied
natasha
laughing
eyes
and
papa
older
she
asked
natasha
sat
down
and
without
joining
boris
conversation
with
the
countess
silently
and
minutely
studied
her
childhood
suitor
felt
the
weight
that
resolute
and
affectionate
scrutiny
and
glanced
her
occasionally
boris
uniform
spurs
tie
and
the
way
his
hair
was
brushed
were
all
comme
faut
and
the
latest
fashion
this
natasha
noticed
once
sat
rather
sideways
the
armchair
next
the
countess
arranging
with
his
right
hand
the
cleanest
gloves
that
fitted
his
left
hand
like
skin
and
spoke
with
particularly
refined
compression
his
lips
about
the
amusements
the
highest
petersburg
society
recalling
with
mild
irony
old
times
moscow
and
moscow
acquaintances
was
not
accidentally
natasha
felt
that
alluded
when
speaking
the
highest
aristocracy
ambassador
ball
had
attended
and
invitations
had
received
from
and
all
this
time
natasha
sat
silent
glancing
him
from
under
her
brows
this
gaze
disturbed
and
confused
boris
more
and
more
looked
round
more
frequently
toward
her
and
broke
off
what
was
saying
did
not
stay
more
than
ten
minutes
then
rose
and
took
his
leave
the
same
inquisitive
challenging
and
rather
mocking
eyes
still
looked
him
after
his
first
visit
boris
said
himself
that
natasha
attracted
him
just
much
ever
but
that
must
not
yield
that
feeling
because
marry
her
girl
almost
without
fortune
would
mean
ruin
his
career
while
renew
their
former
relations
without
intending
marry
her
would
dishonorable
boris
made
his
mind
avoid
meeting
natasha
but
despite
that
resolution
called
again
few
days
later
and
began
calling
often
and
spending
whole
days
the
rostovs
seemed
him
that
ought
have
explanation
with
natasha
and
tell
her
that
the
old
times
must
forgotten
that
spite
everything
she
could
not
his
wife
that
had
means
and
they
would
never
let
her
marry
him
but
failed
and
felt
awkward
about
entering
such
explanation
from
day
day
became
more
and
more
entangled
seemed
her
mother
and
sonya
that
natasha
was
love
with
boris
old
she
sang
him
his
favorite
songs
showed
him
her
album
making
him
write
did
not
allow
him
allude
the
past
letting
understood
how
delightful
was
the
present
and
every
day
went
away
fog
without
having
said
what
meant
and
not
knowing
what
was
doing
why
came
how
would
all
end
left
off
visiting
helene
and
received
reproachful
notes
from
her
every
day
and
yet
continued
spend
whole
days
with
the
rostovs
chapter
xiii
one
night
when
the
old
countess
nightcap
and
dressing
jacket
without
her
false
curls
and
with
her
poor
little
knob
hair
showing
under
her
white
cotton
cap
knelt
sighing
and
groaning
rug
and
bowing
the
ground
prayer
her
door
creaked
and
natasha
also
dressing
jacket
with
slippers
her
bare
feet
and
her
hair
curlpapers
ran
the
countess
her
prayerful
mood
dispelled
looked
round
and
frowned
she
was
finishing
her
last
prayer
can
that
this
couch
will
grave
natasha
flushed
and
eager
seeing
her
mother
prayer
suddenly
checked
her
rush
half
sat
down
and
unconsciously
put
out
her
tongue
chiding
herself
seeing
that
her
mother
was
still
praying
she
ran
tiptoe
the
bed
and
rapidly
slipping
one
little
foot
against
the
other
pushed
off
her
slippers
and
jumped
onto
the
bed
the
countess
had
feared
might
become
her
grave
this
couch
was
high
with
feather
bed
and
five
pillows
each
smaller
than
the
one
below
natasha
jumped
sank
into
the
feather
bed
rolled
over
the
wall
and
began
snuggling
the
bedclothes
she
settled
down
raising
her
knees
her
chin
kicking
out
and
laughing
almost
inaudibly
now
covering
herself
head
and
all
and
now
peeping
her
mother
the
countess
finished
her
prayers
and
came
the
bed
with
stern
face
but
seeing
that
natasha
head
was
covered
she
smiled
her
kind
weak
way
now
then
now
then
said
she
mamma
can
have
talk
yes
said
natasha
now
just
one
your
throat
and
another
that
and
seizing
her
mother
round
the
neck
she
kissed
her
the
throat
her
behavior
her
mother
natasha
seemed
rough
but
she
was
sensitive
and
tactful
that
however
she
clasped
her
mother
she
always
managed
without
hurting
her
making
her
feel
uncomfortable
displeased
well
what
tonight
said
the
mother
having
arranged
her
pillows
and
waited
until
natasha
after
turning
over
couple
times
had
settled
down
beside
her
under
the
quilt
spread
out
her
arms
and
assumed
serious
expression
these
visits
natasha
night
before
the
count
returned
from
his
club
were
one
the
greatest
pleasures
both
mother
and

steadily
straight
before

the
mahogany
sphinxes
carved
the
corners

bedstead
that
the
countess
only
saw
her
daughter
face
profile
that
face
struck
her
its
peculiarly
serious
and
concentrated
expression
natasha
was
listening

she
rushed
forward
that
the

who

not

enough
and
piece

torn

peronskaya
was
quite
ready
spite
her
age
and
plainness
she
had
gone
through
the
same
process
the
rostovs
but
with
less
flurry
for
her
was
matter
routine
her
ugly
old
body
was
washed
perfumed
and
powdered
just
the
same
way
she
had
washed
behind
her
ears
just
carefully
and
when
she
entered
her
drawing
room
her
yellow
dress
wearing
her
badge
maid
honor
her
old
lady
maid
was
full
rapturous
admiration

praised
her
taste
and
toilet
and

careful
their
coiffures

they
settled
themselves

and
drove
off
chapter
natasha
had
not
had
moment
free
since
early
morning
and
had
not
once
had
time
think
what
lay
before
her
the
damp
chill
air
and
crowded
closeness
the
swaying
carriage
she
for
the
first
time
vividly
imagined
what
was
store
for
her
there
the
ball
those
brightly
lighted
rooms
with
music
flowers
dances
the
emperor
and
all
the
brilliant
young
people
petersburg
the
prospect
was
splendid
that
she
hardly
believed
would
come
true
out
keeping
was
with
the
chill
darkness
and
closeness
the
carriage
she
understood
all
that
awaited
her
only
when
after
stepping
over
the
red
baize
the
entrance
she
entered
the
hall
took
off
her
fur
cloak
and
beside
sonya
and
front
her
mother
mounted
the
brightly
illuminated
stairs
between
the
flowers
only
then
did
she
remember
how
she
must
behave
ball
and
tried
assume
the
majestic
air
she
considered
indispensable
for
girl
such
occasion
but
fortunately
for
her
she
felt
her
eyes
growing
misty
she
saw
nothing
clearly
her
pulse
beat
hundred
the
minute
and
the
blood
throbbed
her
heart
she
could
not
assume
that
pose
which
would
have
made
her
ridiculous
and
she
moved
almost
fainting
from
excitement
and
trying
with
all
her
might
conceal
and
this
was
the
very
attitude
that
became
her
best
before
and
behind
them
other
visitors
were
entering
also
talking
low
tones
and
wearing
ball
dresses
the
mirrors
the
landing
reflected
ladies
white
pale
blue
and
pink
dresses
with
diamonds
and
pearls
their
bare
necks
and
arms
natasha
looked
the
mirrors
and
could
not
distinguish
her
reflection
from
the
others
all
was
blended
into
one
brilliant
procession
entering
the
ballroom
the
regular
hum
voices
footsteps
and
greetings
deafened
natasha
and
the
light
and
glitter
dazzled
her
still
more
the
host
and
hostess
who
had
already
been
standing
the
door
for
half
hour
repeating
the
same
words

various

greeted
the
rostovs

peronskaya
the

manner
delighted
see
you
the
two
girls
their
white
dresses
each
with
rose
her
black
hair
both
curtsied
the
same
way
but
the

involuntarily
rested

looked

gave
her

between

women
who
crowded
near
the

not
having
been
invited

she
stood
with
her
slender
arms
hanging
down
her
scarcely
defined
bosom
rising
and
falling

and
with
bated
breath
and
glittering
frightened

gazed
straight
before

she
was
not
concerned
about
the

any
those
great
people

natasha
danced
exquisitely
her
little
feet
their
white
satin
dancing
shoes
did
their
work
swiftly
lightly
and
independently
herself
while
her
face
beamed
with
ecstatic
happiness
her
slender
bare
arms
and
neck
were
not
beautiful
compared

have
felt
very
much
ashamed
had
she
not
been
assured
that
this
was
absolutely
necessary
prince
andrew
liked
dancing
and

and
clever
talk
which
everyone

break
the
circle

disliked
caused
the
emperor
presence
danced
and
had
chosen
natasha
because
pierre
pointed
her
out
him
and
because
she
was
the
first
pretty
girl
who
caught
his
eye
but
scarcely
had
embraced
that
slender
supple
figure
and
felt
her
stirring
close
him
and
smiling
near
him
than
the
wine
her
charm
rose
his
head
and
felt
himself
revived
and
rejuvenated
when
after
leaving
her
stood
breathing
deeply
and
watching
the
other
dancers
chapter
xvii
after
prince
andrew
boris
came
ask
natasha
for
dance
and
then
the
aide
camp
who
had
opened
the
ball
and
several
other
young
men
that
flushed
and
happy
and
passing
her
superfluous
partners
sonya
she
did
not
cease
dancing
all
the
evening
she
noticed
and
saw
nothing
what
occupied
everyone
else
not
only
did
she
fail
notice
that
the
emperor
talked
long
time
with
the
french
ambassador
and
how
particularly
gracious
was
certain
lady
that
prince
and
and
and
did
and
said
this
and
that
and
that
helene
had
great
success
and
was
honored
the
special
attention
and
but
she
did
not
even
see
the
emperor
and
only
noticed
that
had
gone
because
the
ball
became
livelier
after
his
departure
for
one
the
merry
cotillions
before
supper
prince
andrew
was
again
her
partner
reminded
her
their
first
encounter
the
otradnoe
avenue
and
how
she
had
been
unable
sleep
that
moonlight
night
and
told
her
how
had
involuntarily
overheard
her
natasha
blushed
that
recollection
and
tried
excuse
herself
there
had
been
something
ashamed
what
prince
andrew
had
overheard
like
all
men
who
have
grown
society
prince
andrew
liked
meeting
someone
there
not
the
conventional
society
stamp
and
such
was
natasha
with
her
surprise
her
delight
her
shyness
and
even
her
mistakes
speaking
french
with
her
behaved
with
special
care
and
tenderness
sitting
beside
her
and
talking
the
simplest
and
most
unimportant
matters
admired
her
shy
grace
the
middle
the
cotillion
having
completed
one
the
figures
natasha
still
out
breath
was
returning
her
seat
when
another
dancer
chose
her
she
was
tired
and
panting
and
evidently
thought
declining
but
immediately
put
her
hand
gaily
the
man
shoulder
smiling
prince
andrew
glad

love
everybody
and
you
and
understand
all
and
much

more
was
said
her
smile
when
her
partner
left
her
natasha
ran
across
the
room
choose
two
ladies
for
the
figure
she
goes
her
cousin
first
and
then
another
lady

said
prince
andrew
himself
quite
his
own
surprise
watched
her
she
did
first
her
cousin
what
rubbish

prince
andrew
but
what

before

said
reproachfully
how

question

never

before
she
said
and
prince

noticed
how
her
thin

her
father

instantly
dropped

chapter
xviii
next
day
prince
andrew
thought
the
ball
but
his
mind
did
not
dwell
long
yes
was
very
brilliant
ball
and
then
yes
that
little
rostova
very
charming
there
something
fresh
original
petersburg
like
about
her
that
distinguishes
her
that
was
all
thought
about
yesterday
ball
and
after
his
morning
tea
set
work
but
either
from
fatigue
want
sleep
was
ill
disposed
for
work
and
could
get
nothing
done
kept
criticizing
his
own
work
often
did
and
was
glad
when
heard
someone
coming
the
visitor
was
bitski
who
served
various
committees
frequented
all
the
societies
petersburg
and
passionate
devotee
the
new
ideas
and
speranski
and
diligent
petersburg
newsmonger
one
those
men
who
choose
their
opinions
like
their
clothes
according
the
fashion
but
who
for
that
very
reason
appear
the
warmest
partisans
hardly
had
got
rid
his
hat
before
ran
into
prince
andrew
room
with
preoccupied
air
and
once
began
talking
had
just
heard
particulars
that
morning
sitting
the
council
state
opened
the
emperor
and
spoke
enthusiastically
the
emperor
speech
had
been
extraordinary
had
been
speech
such
only
constitutional
monarchs
deliver
the
sovereign
plainly
said
that
the
council
and
senate
are
estates
the
realm
said
that
the
government
must
rest
not
authority
but
secure
bases
the
emperor
said
that
the
fiscal
system
must
reorganized
and
the
accounts
published
recounted
bitski
emphasizing
certain
words
and
opening
his
eyes
significantly
yes
today
events
mark
epoch
the
greatest
epoch
our
history
concluded
prince
andrew
listened
the
account
the
opening
the
council
state
which
had
impatiently
awaited
and
which
had
attached
such
importance
and
was
surprised
that
this
event
now
that
had
taken
place
did
not
affect
him
and
even
seemed
quite
insignificant
listened
with
quiet
irony
bitski
enthusiastic
account
very
simple
thought
occurred
him
what
does
matter
bitski
what
the
emperor
was
pleased
say
the
council
can
all
that
make
any
happier
better
and
this
simple
reflection
suddenly
destroyed
all
the
interest
prince
andrew
had
felt
the
impending
reforms
was
going
dine
that
evening
speranski
with
only
few
friends
the
host
had
said
when
inviting
him
the
prospect
that
dinner
the
intimate
home
circle
the
man
admired
had
greatly
interested
prince
andrew
especially
had
not
yet
seen
speranski
his
domestic
surroundings
but
now
felt
disinclined
the
appointed
hour
however
entered
the
modest
house
speranski
owned
the
taurida
gardens
the
parqueted
dining
room
this
small
house
remarkable
for
its
extreme
cleanliness
suggesting
that
monastery
prince
andrew
who
was
rather
late
found
the
friendly
gathering
speranski
intimate
acquaintances
already
assembled
five
clock
there
were
ladies
present
except
speranski
little
daughter
long
faced
like
her
father
and
her
governess
the
other
guests
were
gervais
magnitski
and
stolypin
while
still
the
anteroom
prince
andrew
heard
loud
voices
and
ringing
staccato
laugh
laugh
such
one
hears
the
stage
someone
sounded
like
speranski
was
distinctly
ejaculating
prince
andrew
had
never
before
heard
speranski
famous
laugh
and
this
ringing
high
pitched
laughter
from
statesman
made
strange
impression
him
entered
the
dining
room
the
whole
company
were
standing
between
two
windows
small
table
laid
with
hors
oeuvres
speranski
wearing
gray
swallow
tail
coat
with
star
the
breast
and
evidently
still
the
same
waistcoat
and
high
white
stock
had
worn
the
meeting
the
council
state
stood
the
table
with
beaming
countenance
his
guests
surrounded
him
magnitski
addressing
himself
speranski
was
relating
anecdote
and
speranski
was
laughing
advance
what
magnitski
was
going
say
when
prince
andrew
entered
the
room
magnitski
words
were
again
crowned
laughter
stolypin
gave
deep
bass
guffaw
munched
piece
bread
and
cheese
gervais
laughed
softly
with
hissing
chuckle
and
speranski
high
pitched
staccato
manner
still
laughing
speranski
held
out
his
soft
white
hand
prince
andrew
very
pleased
see
you
prince
said
one
moment
went
turning
magnitski
and
interrupting
his
story
have
agreed
that
this
dinner
for
recreation
with
not
word
about
business
and
turning
again
the
narrator
began
laugh
afresh
prince
andrew
looked
the
laughing
speranski
with
astonishment
regret
and
disillusionment
seemed
him
that
this
was
not
speranski
but
someone
else
everything
that
had
formerly
appeared
mysterious
and
fascinating
speranski
suddenly
became
plain
and
unattractive
dinner
the
conversation
did
not
cease
for
moment
and
seemed
consist
the
contents
book
funny
anecdotes
before
magnitski
had
finished
his
story
someone
else
was
anxious
relate
something
still
funnier
most
the
anecdotes
not
relating
the
state
service
related
people
the
service
seemed
that
this
company
the
insignificance
those
people
was
definitely
accepted
that
the
only
possible
attitude
toward
them
was
one
good
humored
ridicule
speranski
related
how
the
council
that
morning
deaf
dignitary
when
asked
his
opinion
replied
that
thought
too
gervais
gave
long
account
official
revision
remarkable
for
the
stupidity
everybody
concerned
stolypin
stuttering
broke
into
the
conversation
and
began
excitedly
talking
the
abuses
that
existed
under
the
former
order
things
threatening
give
serious
turn
the
conversation
magnitski
starting
quizzing
stolypin
about
his
vehemence
gervais
intervened
with
joke
and
the
talk
reverted
its
former
lively
tone
evidently
speranski
liked
rest
after
his
labors
and
find
amusement
circle
friends
and
his
guests
understanding
his
wish
tried
enliven
him
and
amuse
themselves
but
their
gaiety
seemed
prince
andrew
mirthless
and
tiresome
speranski
high
pitched
voice
struck
him
unpleasantly
and
the
incessant
laughter
grated
him
like
false
note
prince
andrew
did
not
laugh
and
feared
that
would
damper
the
spirits
the
company
but
one
took
any
notice
his
being
out
harmony
with
the
general
mood
they
all
seemed
very
gay
tried
several
times
join
the
conversation
but
his
remarks
were
tossed
aside
each
time
like
cork
thrown
out
the
water
and
could
not
jest
with
them
there
was
nothing
wrong
unseemly
what
they
said
was
witty
and
might
have
been
funny
but
lacked
just
that
something
which
the
salt
mirth
and
they
were
not
even
aware
that
such
thing
existed
after
dinner
speranski
daughter
and
her
governess
rose
patted
the
little
girl
with
his
white
hand
and
kissed
her
and
that
gesture
too
seemed
unnatural
prince
andrew
the
men
remained
table
over
their
port
english
fashion
the
midst
conversation
that
was
started
about
napoleon
spanish
affairs
which
they
all
agreed
approving
prince
andrew
began
express
contrary
opinion
speranski
smiled
and
with
evident
wish
prevent
the
conversation
from
taking
unpleasant
course
told
story
that
had
connection
with
the
previous
conversation
for
few
moments
all
were
silent
having
sat
some
time
table
speranski
corked
bottle
wine
and
remarking
nowadays
good
wine
rides
carriage
and
pair
passed
the
servant
and
got
all
rose
and
continuing
talk
loudly
went
into
the
drawing
room
two
letters
brought
courier
were
handed
speranski
and
took
them
his
study
soon
had
left
the
room
the
general
merriment
stopped
and
the
guests
began
converse
sensibly
and
quietly
with
one
another
now
for
the
recitation
said
speranski
returning
from
his
study
wonderful
talent
said
prince
andrew
and
magnitski
immediately
assumed
pose
and
began
reciting
some
humorous
verses
french
which
had
composed
about
various
well
known
petersburg
people
was
interrupted
several
times
applause
when
the
verses
were
finished
prince
andrew
went
speranski
and
took
his
leave
where
are
you
off
early
asked
speranski
promised
reception
they
said
more
prince
andrew
looked
closely
into
those
mirrorlike
impenetrable
eyes
and
felt
that
had
been
ridiculous
him
have
expected
anything
from
speranski
and
from
any
his
own
activities
connected
with
him
ever
have
attributed
importance
what
speranski
was
doing
that
precise
mirthless
laughter
rang
prince
andrew
ears
long
after
had
left
the
house
when
reached
home
prince
andrew
began
thinking
his
life
petersburg
during
those
last
four
months
were
something
new
recalled
his
exertions
and
solicitations
and
the
history
his
project
army
reform
which
had
been
accepted
for
consideration
and
which
they
were
trying
pass
over
silence
simply
because
another
very
poor
one
had
already
been
prepared
and
submitted
the
emperor
thought
the
meetings
committee
which
berg
was
member
remembered
how
carefully
and
what
length
everything
relating
form
and
procedure
was
discussed
those
meetings
and
how
sedulously
and
promptly
all
that
related
the
gist
the
business
was
evaded
recalled
his
labors
the
legal
code
and
how
painstakingly
had
translated
the
articles
the
roman
and
french
codes
into
russian
and
felt
ashamed
himself
then
vividly
pictured
himself
bogucharovo
his
occupations
the
country
his
journey
ryazan
remembered
the
peasants
and
dron
the
village
elder
and
mentally
applying
them
the
personal
rights
had
divided
into
paragraphs
felt
astonished
that
could
have
spent
much
time
such
useless
work
chapter
xix
next
day
prince
andrew
called
few
houses
had
not
visited
before
and
among
them
the
rostovs
with
whom
had
renewed
acquaintance
the
ball
apart
from
considerations
politeness
which
demanded
the
call
wanted
see
that
original
eager
girl
who
had
left
such
pleasant
impression
his
mind
her
own
home
natasha
was
one
the
first
meet
him
she
was
wearing
dark
blue
house
dress
which
prince
andrew
thought
her
even
prettier
than
her
ball
dress
she
and
all
the
rostov
family
welcomed
him
old
friend
simply
and
cordially
the
whole
family
whom
had
formerly
judged
severely
now
seemed
him
consist
excellent
simple
and
kindly
people
the
old
count
hospitality
and
good
nature
which
struck
one
especially
petersburg
pleasant
surprise
were
such
that
prince
andrew
could
not
refuse
stay
dinner
yes
thought
they
are
capital
people
who
course
have
not
the
slightest
idea
what
treasure
they
possess
natasha
but
they
are
kindly
folk
and
form
the
best
possible
setting
for
this
strikingly
poetic
charming
girl
overflowing
with
life
natasha
prince
andrew
was
conscious
strange
world
completely
alien
him
and
brimful
joys
unknown
him
different
world
that
the
otradnoe
avenue
and
the
window
that
moonlight
night
had
already
begun
disconcert
him
now
this
world
disconcerted
him
longer
and
was
longer
alien
him
but
himself
having
entered
found
new
enjoyment
after
dinner
natasha
prince
andrew
request
went
the
clavichord
and
began
singing
prince
andrew
stood
window
talking
the
ladies
and
listened
her
the
midst
phrase
ceased
speaking
and
suddenly
felt
tears
choking
him
thing
had
thought
impossible
for
him
looked
natasha
she
sang
and
something
new
and
joyful
stirred
his
soul
felt
happy
and
the
same
time
sad
had
absolutely
nothing
weep
about
yet
was
ready
weep
what
about
his
former
love
the
little
princess
his
disillusionments
his
hopes
for
the
future
yes
and
the
chief
reason
was
sudden
vivid
sense
the
terrible
contrast
between
something
infinitely
great
and
illimitable
within
him
and
that
limited
and
material
something
that
and
even
she
was
this
contrast
weighed
and
yet
cheered
him
while
she
sang
soon
natasha
had
finished
she
went
him
and
asked
how
liked
her
voice
she
asked
this
and
then
became
confused
feeling
that
she
ought
not
have
asked
smiled
looking
her
and
said
liked
her
singing
liked
everything
she
did
prince
andrew
left
the
rostovs
late
the
evening
went
bed
from
habit
but
soon
realized
that
could
not
sleep
having
lit
his
candle
sat
bed
then
got
then
lay
down
again
not
all
troubled
his
sleeplessness
his
soul
was
fresh
and
joyful
had
stepped
out
stuffy
room
into
god
own
fresh
air
did
not
enter
his
head
that
was
love
with
natasha
was
not
thinking
about
her
but
only
picturing
her
himself
and
consequence
all
life
appeared
new
light
why
strive
why
toil
this
narrow
confined
frame
when
life
all
life
with
all
its
joys
open
said
himself
and
for
the
first
time
for
very
long
while
began
making
happy
plans
for
the
future
decided
that
must
attend
his
son
education
finding
tutor
and
putting
the
boy
his
charge
then
ought
retire
from
the
service
and
abroad
and
see
england
switzerland
and
italy

use
freedom
while
feel
much
strength
and

right
when
said
one
must
believe
the
possibility
happiness
order
happy
and
now
believe
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
but
while
one
has
life
one
must
live
and

thought

were
ready
for
their

new
clean
and
light

and
new

sat
berg
and
his
wife
berg
closely
buttoned
his
new
uniform
sat
beside
his
wife
explaining
her
that

conscientious
and
methodical
berg
smiled
with
sense
his
superiority
over
weak
woman
and
paused
reflecting
that
this
dear
wife
his
was
after
all
but
weak
woman
who
could
not
understand
all
that
constitutes

with

over

all

berg
judging
his

all

said

pointing
the

with
happy
and
kindly
smile
just
then
count
bezukhov
was
announced
husband
and
wife
glanced
one
another
both
smiling
with
self
satisfaction
and
each
mentally
claiming
the
honor
this
visit
this
what
comes
knowing
how
make
acquaintances
thought
berg
this
what
comes
knowing
how
conduct
oneself
but
please
don
interrupt
when
entertaining
the
guests
said
vera
because
know
what
interests
each
them
and
what
say
different
people
berg
smiled
again
can
helped
men
must
sometimes
have
masculine
conversation
said
they
received
pierre
their
small
new
drawing
room
where
was
impossible
sit
down
anywhere
without
disturbing
its
symmetry
neatness
and
order
was
quite
comprehensible
and
not
strange
that
berg
having
generously
offered
disturb
the
symmetry
armchair
the
sofa
for
his
dear
guest
but
being
apparently
painfully
undecided
the
matter
himself
eventually
left
the
visitor
settle
the
question
selection
pierre
disturbed
the
symmetry
moving
chair
for
himself
and
berg
and
vera
immediately
began
their
evening
party
interrupting
each
other
their
efforts
entertain
their
guest
vera
having
decided
her
own
mind
that
pierre
ought
entertained
with
conversation
about
the
french
embassy
once
began
accordingly
berg
having
decided
that
masculine
conversation
was
required
interrupted
his
wife
remarks
and
touched
the
question
the
war
with
austria
and
unconsciously
jumped
from
the
general
subject
personal
considerations
the
proposals
made
him
take
part
the
austrian
campaign
and
the
reasons
why
had
declined
them
though
the
conversation
was
very
incoherent
and
vera
was
angry
the
intrusion
the
masculine
element
both
husband
and
wife
felt
with
satisfaction
that
even
only
one
guest
was
present
their
evening
had
begun
very
well
and
was
like
two
peas
every
other
evening
party
with
its
talk
tea
and
lighted
candles
before
long
boris
berg
old
comrade
arrived
there
was
shade
condescension
and
patronage
his
treatment
berg
and
vera
after
boris
came
lady
with
the
colonel
then
the
general
himself
then
the
rostovs
and
the
party
became
unquestionably
exactly
like
all
other
evening
parties
berg
and
vera
could
not
repress
their
smiles
satisfaction
the
sight
all
this
movement
their
drawing
room
the
sound
the
disconnected
talk
the
rustling
dresses
and
the
bowing
and
scraping
everything
was
just
everybody
always
has
especially
the
general
who
admired
the
apartment
patted
berg
the
shoulder
and
with
parental
authority
superintended
the
setting
out
the
table
for
boston
the
general
sat
down
count

rostov
who
was
next
himself
the
most
important
guest
the
old
people
sat
with

pierre
one
the
principal
guests
had
sit
down
boston
with
count
rostov
the
general
and
the
colonel
the
card
table
happened
directly
facing
natasha
and
was
struck
curious
change
that
had
come
over
her
since
the
ball
she
was
silent
and
not
only
less
pretty
than
the
ball
but
only
redeemed
from
plainness
her
look
gentle
indifference
everything
around
what
the
matter
with
her
thought
pierre
glancing
her
she
was
sitting
her
sister
the
tea
table
and
reluctantly
without
looking
him
made
some
reply
boris
who
sat
down
beside
her
after
playing
out
whole
suit
and
his
partner
delight
taking
five
tricks
pierre
hearing
greetings
and
the
steps
someone
who
had
entered
the
room
while
was
picking
his
tricks
glanced
again
natasha
what
has
happened
her
asked
himself
with
still
greater
surprise
prince
andrew
was
standing
before
her
saying
something
her
with
look
tender
solicitude
she
having
raised
her
head
was
looking
him
flushed
and
evidently
trying
master
her
rapid
breathing
and
the
bright
glow
some
inner
fire
that
had
been
suppressed
was
again
alight
her
she
was
completely
transformed
and
from
plain
girl
had
again
become
what
she
had
been
the
ball
prince
andrew
went
pierre
and
the
latter
noticed
new
and
youthful
expression
his
friend
face
pierre
changed
places
several
times
during
the
game
sitting
now
with
his
back
natasha
and
now
facing
her
but
during
the
whole
the
six
rubbers
watched
her
and
his
friend
something
very
important
happening
between
them
thought
pierre
and
feeling
that
was
both
joyful
and
painful
agitated
him
and
made
him
neglect
the
game
after
six
rubbers
the
general
got
saying
that
was
use
playing
like
that
and
pierre
was
released
natasha
one
side
was
talking
with
sonya
and
boris
and
vera
with
subtle
smile
was
saying
something
prince
andrew
pierre
went
his
friend
and
asking
whether
they
were
talking
secrets
sat
down
beside
them
vera
having
noticed
prince
andrew
attentions
natasha
decided
that
party
real
evening
party
subtle
allusions
the
tender
passion
were
absolutely
necessary
and
seizing
moment
when
prince
andrew
was
alone
began
conversation
with
him
about
feelings
general
and
about
her
sister
with
intellectual
guest
she
considered
prince
andrew
she
felt
that
she
had
employ
her
diplomatic
tact
when
pierre
went
them
noticed
that
vera
was
being
carried
away
her
self
satisfied
talk
but
that
prince
andrew
seemed
embarrassed
thing
that
rarely
happened
with
him
what
you
think
vera
was
saying
with
arch
smile
you
are
discerning
prince
and
understand
people
characters
well
glance
what
you
think
natalie
could
she
constant
her
attachments
could
she
like
other
women
vera
meant
herself
love
man
once
for
all
and
remain
true
him
forever
that
what
consider
true
love
what
you
think
prince
know
your
sister
too
little
replied
prince
andrew
with
sarcastic
smile
under
which
wished
hide
his
embarrassment
able
solve
delicate
question
and
then
have
noticed
that
the
less
attractive
woman
the
more
constant
she
likely
added
and
looked
pierre
who
was
just
approaching
them
yes
that
true
prince
our
days
continued
vera
mentioning
our
days
people
limited
intelligence
are
fond
doing
imagining
that
they
have
discovered
and
appraised
the
peculiarities
our
days
and
that
human
characteristics
change
with
the
times
our
days
girl
has
much
freedom
that
the
pleasure
being
courted
often
stifles
real
feeling
her
and
must
confessed
that
natalie
very
susceptible
this
return
the
subject
natalie
caused
prince
andrew
knit
his
brows
with
discomfort
was
about
rise
but
vera
continued
with
still
more
subtle
smile
think
one
has
been
more
courted
than
she
she
went
but
till
quite
lately
she
never
cared
seriously
for
anyone
now
you
know
count
she
said
pierre
even
our
dear
cousin
boris
who
between
ourselves
was
very
far
gone
the
land
tenderness
alluding
map
love
much
vogue
that
time
prince
andrew
frowned
and
remained
silent
you
are
friendly
with
boris
aren
you
asked
vera
yes
know
him
expect
has
told
you
his
childish
love
for
natasha
there
was
childish
love
suddenly
asked
prince
andrew
blushing
unexpectedly
yes
you
know
between
cousins
intimacy
often
leads
love
cousinage
est
dangereux
voisinage
don
you
think
cousinhood
dangerous
neighborhood
undoubtedly
said
prince
andrew
and
with
sudden
and
unnatural
liveliness
began
chaffing
pierre
about
the
need
very
careful
with
his
fifty
year
old
moscow
cousins
and
the
midst
these
jesting
remarks
rose
taking
pierre
the
arm
and
drew
him
aside
well
asked
pierre
seeing
his
friend
strange
animation
with
surprise
and
noticing
the
glance
turned
natasha
rose
must
must
have
talk
with
you
said
prince
andrew
you
know
that
pair
women
gloves
referred
the
masonic
gloves
given
newly
initiated
brother
present
the
woman
loved
but
will
talk
you
later
and
with
strange
light
his
eyes
and
restlessness
his
movements
prince
andrew
approached
natasha
and
sat
down
beside
her
pierre
saw
how
prince
andrew
asked
her
something
and
how
she
flushed
she
replied
but
that
moment
berg
came
pierre
and
began
insisting
that
should
take
part
argument
between
the
general
and
the
colonel
the
affairs
spain
berg
was
satisfied
and
happy
the
smile
pleasure
never
left
his
face
the
party
was
very
successful
and
quite
like
other
parties
had
seen
everything
was
similar
the
ladies
subtle
talk
the
cards
the
general
raising
his
voice
the
card
table
and
the
samovar
and
the
tea
cakes
only
one
thing
was
lacking
that
had
always
seen
the
evening
parties
wished
imitate
they
had
not
yet
had
loud
conversation
among
the
men
and
dispute
about
something
important
and
clever
now
the
general
had
begun
such
discussion
and
berg
drew
pierre
chapter
xxii
next
day
having
been
invited
the
count
prince
andrew
dined
with
the
rostovs
and
spent
the
rest
the
day
there
everyone
the
house
realized
for
whose
sake
prince
andrew
came
and
without
concealing
tried
with
natasha
all
day
not
only
the
soul
the
frightened
yet
happy
and
enraptured
natasha
but
the
whole
house
there
was
feeling
awe
something
important
that
was
bound
happen
the
countess
looked
with
sad
and
sternly
serious
eyes
prince
andrew
when
talked
natasha
and
timidly
started
some
artificial
conversation
about
trifles
soon
looked
her
way
sonya
was
afraid
leave
natasha
and
afraid
being
the
way
when
she
was
with
them
natasha
grew
pale
panic
expectation
when
she
remained
alone
with
him
for
moment
prince
andrew
surprised
her
his
timidity
she
felt
that
wanted
say
something
her
but
could
not
bring
himself
the
evening
when
prince
andrew
had
left
the
countess
went
natasha
and
whispered
well
what
mamma
for
heaven
sake
don
ask
anything
now
one
can
talk
about
that
said
natasha
but
all
the
same
that
night
natasha
now
agitated
and
now
frightened
lay
long
time
her
mother
bed
gazing
straight
before
her
she
told
her
how
had
complimented
her
how
told
her
was
going
abroad
asked
her
where
they
were
going
spend
the
summer
and
then
how
had
asked
her
about
boris
but
such
such
never
happened
before
she
said
only
feel
afraid
his
presence
always
afraid
when
with
him
what
does
that
mean
does
mean
that
the
real
thing
yes
mamma
are
you
asleep
love
frightened
myself
answered
her
mother
now
all
the
same
shan
sleep
what
silliness
sleep
mummy
mummy
such
thing
never
happened
before
she
said
surprised
and
alarmed
the
feeling
she
was
aware
herself
and
could
ever
have
thought
seemed
natasha
that
even
the
time
she
first
saw
prince
andrew
otradnoe
she
had
fallen
love
with
him
was
she
feared
this
strange
unexpected
happiness
meeting
again
the
very
man
she
had
then
chosen
she
was
firmly
convinced
she
had
done
and
finding
him
seemed
not
indifferent
her
and
had
happen
that
should
come
specially
petersburg
while
are
here
and
had
happen
that
should
meet
that
ball
fate
clearly
fate
that
everything
led
this
already
then
directly
saw
him
felt
something
peculiar
what
else
did
say
you
what
are
those
verses
read
them
said
her
mother
thoughtfully
referring
some
verses
prince
andrew
had
written
natasha
album
mamma
one
need
not
ashamed
his
being
widower
don
natasha
pray
god
marriages
are
made
heaven
said
her
mother
darling
mummy
how
love
you
how
happy
cried
natasha
shedding
tears
joy
and
excitement
and
embracing
her
mother
that
very
time
prince
andrew
was
sitting
with
pierre
and
telling
him
his
love
for
natasha
and
his
firm
resolve
make
her
his
wife
that
day
countess
helene
had
reception
her
house
the
french
ambassador
was
there
and
foreign
prince
the
blood
who
had
late
become
frequent
visitor
hers
and
many
brilliant
ladies
and
gentlemen
pierre
who
had
come
downstairs
walked
through
the
rooms
and
struck
everyone
his
preoccupied
absent
minded
and
morose
air
since
the
ball
had
felt
the
approach
fit
nervous
depression
and
had
made
desperate
efforts
combat
since
the
intimacy
his
wife
with
the
royal
prince
pierre
had
unexpectedly
been
made
gentleman
the
bedchamber
and
from
that
time
had
begun
feel
oppressed
and
ashamed
court
society
and
dark
thoughts
the
vanity
all
things
human
came
him
oftener
than
before
the
same
time
the
feeling
had
noticed
between
his
protegee
natasha
and
prince
andrew
accentuated
his
gloom
the
contrast
between
his
own
position
and
his
friend
tried
equally
avoid
thinking
about
his
wife
and
about
natasha
and
prince
andrew
and
again
everything
seemed
him
insignificant
comparison
with
eternity
again
the
question
for
what
presented
itself
and
forced
himself
work
day
and
night
masonic
labors
hoping
drive
away
the
evil
spirit
that
threatened
him
toward
midnight
after
had
left
the
countess
apartments
was
sitting
upstairs
shabby
dressing
gown
copying
out
the
original
transaction
the
scottish
lodge
freemasons
table
his
low
room
cloudy
with
tobacco
smoke
when
someone
came
was
prince
andrew
you
said
pierre
with
preoccupied
dissatisfied
air
and
you
see
hard
pointed
his
manuscript
book
with
that
air
escaping
from
the
ills
life
with
which
unhappy
people
look
their
work
prince
andrew
with
beaming
ecstatic
expression
renewed
life
his
face
paused
front
pierre
and
not
noticing
his
sad
look
smiled
him
with
the
egotism
joy
well
dear
heart
said
wanted
tell
you
about
yesterday
and
have
come
today
never
experienced
anything
like
before
love
friend
suddenly
pierre
heaved
deep
sigh
and
dumped
his
heavy
person
down
the
sofa
beside
prince
andrew
with
natasha
rostova
yes
said
yes
yes
who
else
should
should
never
have
believed
but
the
feeling
stronger
than
yesterday
tormented
myself
and
suffered
but
would
not
exchange
even
that
torment
for
anything
the
world
have
not
lived
till
now
last
live
but
can
live
without
her
but
can
she
love
too
old
for
her
why
don
you
speak
what
did
tell
you
said
pierre
suddenly
rising
and
beginning
pace
and
down
the
room
always
thought
that
girl
such
treasure
she
rare
girl
dear
friend
entreat
you
don
philosophize
don
doubt
marry
marry
marry
and
sure
there
will
not
happier
man
than
you
but
what
her
she
loves
you
don
talk
rubbish
said
prince
andrew
smiling
and
looking
into
pierre
eyes
she
does
know
pierre
cried
fiercely
but
listen
returned
prince
andrew
holding
him
the
arm
you
know
the
condition
must
talk
about
someone
well
very
glad
said
pierre
and
his
face
really
changed
his
brow
became
smooth
and
listened
gladly
prince
andrew
prince
andrew
seemed
and
really
was
quite
different
quite
new
man
where
was
his
spleen
his
contempt
for
life
his
disillusionment
pierre
was
the
only
person
whom
made
his
mind
speak
openly
and
him
told
all
that
was
his
soul
now
boldly
and
lightly
made
plans
for
extended
future
said
could
not
sacrifice
his
own
happiness
his
father
caprice
and
spoke
how
would
either
make
his
father
consent
this
marriage
and
love
her
would
without
his
consent
then
marveled
the
feeling
that
had
mastered
him
something
strange
apart
from
and
independent
himself
should
not
have
believed
anyone
who
told
that
was
capable
such
love
said
prince
andrew
not
all
the
same
feeling
that
knew
the
past
the
whole
world
now
for
divided
into
two
halves
one
half
she
and
there
all
joy
hope
light
the
other
half
everything
where
she
not
and
there
all
gloom
and
darkness
darkness
and
gloom
reiterated
pierre
yes
yes
understand
that
cannot
help
loving
the
light
not
fault
and
very
happy
you
understand
know
you
are
glad
for
sake
yes
yes
pierre
assented
looking
his
friend
with
touched
and
sad
expression
his
eyes
the
brighter
prince

lot
appeared
him
the
gloomier
seemed
his
own
chapter

started
for
the

next
day
his
father
received
his

external
composure

inward

not
comprehend

introduce
anything
new
into
when
his

the

adopting

the
whole

secondly
prince

that
last
word
mind
the
last
concluded
the
prince
tone
which
showed
that
nothing
would
make
him
alter
his
decision
prince
andrew
saw
clearly
that
the
old
man
hoped
that
his
feelings
his
fiancee
would
not
stand
year
test
that
the
old
prince
himself
would
die
before
then
and
decided
conform
his
father
wish
propose
and
postpone
the
wedding
for
year
three
weeks
after
the
last
evening
had
spent
with
the
rostovs
prince
andrew
returned
petersburg
next
day
after
her
talk
with
her
mother
natasha
expected
bolkonski
all
day
but
did
not
come
the
second
and
third
day
was
the
same
pierre
did
not
come
either
and
natasha
not
knowing
that
prince
andrew
had
gone
see
his
father
could
not
explain
his
absence
herself
three
weeks
passed
this
way
natasha
had
desire
out
anywhere
and
wandered
from
room
room
like
shadow
idle
and
listless
she
wept
secretly
night
and
did
not
her
mother
the
evenings
she
blushed
continually
and
was
irritable
seemed
her
that
everybody
knew
about
her
disappointment
and
was
laughing
her
and
pitying
her
strong
was
her
inward
grief
this
wound
her
vanity
intensified
her
misery
once
she
came
her
mother
tried
say
something
and
suddenly
began
cry
her
tears
were
those
offended
child
who
does
not
know
why
being
punished
the
countess
began
soothe
natasha
who
after
first
listening
her
mother
words
suddenly
interrupted
her
leave
off
mamma
don
think
and
don
want
think
about
just
came
and
then
left
off
left
off
her
voice
trembled
and
she
again
nearly
cried
but
recovered
and
went
quietly
and
don
all
want
get
married
and
afraid
him
have
now
become
quite
calm
quite
calm
the
day
after
this
conversation
natasha
put
the
old
dress
which
she
knew
had
the
peculiar
property
conducing
cheerfulness
the
mornings
and
that
day
she
returned
the
old
way
life
which
she
had
abandoned
since
the
ball
having
finished
her
morning
tea
she
went
the
ballroom
which
she
particularly
liked
for
its
loud
resonance
and
began
singing
her
solfeggio
when
she
had
finished
her
first
exercise
she
stood
still
the
middle
the
room
and
sang
musical
phrase
that
particularly
pleased
her
she
listened
joyfully
though
she
had
not
expected
the
charm
the
notes
reverberating
filling
the
whole
empty
ballroom
and
slowly
dying
away
and
all
once
she
felt
cheerful
what
the
good
making
much
things
are
nice
she
said
herself
and
she
began
walking
and
down
the
room
not
stepping
simply
the
resounding
parquet
but
treading
with
each
step
from
the
heel
the
toe
she
had
new
and
favorite
pair
shoes
and
listening
the
regular
tap
the
heel
and
creak
the
toe
gladly
she
had
the
sounds
her
own
voice
passing
mirror
she
glanced
into
there
that
the
expression
her
face
seemed
say
she
caught
sight
herself
well
and
very
nice
too
need
nobody
footman
wanted
come
clear
away
something
the
room
but
she
would
not
let
him
and
having
closed
the
door
behind
him
continued
her
walk
that
morning
she
had
returned
her
favorite
mood
love
and
delight
herself
how
charming
that
natasha
she
said
again
speaking
some
third
collective
male
person
pretty
good
voice
young
and
nobody
way
only
they
leave
her
peace
but
however
much
they
left
her
peace
she
could
not
now
peace
and
immediately
felt
this
the
hall
the
porch
door
opened
and
someone
asked
home
and
then
footsteps
were
heard
natasha
was
looking
the
mirror
but
did
not
see
herself
she
listened
the
sounds
the
hall
when
she
saw
herself
her
face
was
pale
was
she
knew
this
for
certain
though
she
hardly
heard
his
voice
through
the
closed
doors
pale
and
agitated
natasha
ran
into
the
drawing
room
mamma
bolkonski
has

she
said
mamma

entered
the
room
with
agitated
and
serious
face
soon
saw
natasha
his
face
brightened
kissed
the
countess
hand
and
natasha
and
sat
down
beside
the
sofa
long
since

the
pleasure

the
countess
but
prince
andrew
interrupted
her

after
moment
pause
the
countess
lowered
her
eyes
sighing
deeply

disposal
she
murmured
natasha
knew
that
she
ought
away
but
was
unable
something
gripped
her
throat
and
regardless
manners
she
stared
straight
prince
andrew
with
wide
open
eyes
once
this
instant
can
she
thought
again
glanced
her
and
that
glance
convinced
her
that
she
was
not
mistaken
yes
once
that
very
instant
her
fate
would
decided
natasha
will
call

said
the
countess
whisper
natasha
glanced
with
frightened
imploring
eyes
prince
andrew
and
her
mother
and
went
out
have
come
countess

for
your
daughter
hand
said
prince
andrew
the
countess
face
flushed
hotly
but
she
said
nothing

offer
she
began
last
sedately
remained
silent
looking
into
her
eyes
your
offer
she
grew
confused
agreeable
and

glad
and
husband

but

prince
andrew
yes
replied
the
countess
she
held
out
her
hand
him
and
with
mixed
feeling
estrangement
and
tenderness
pressed
her
lips
his
forehead
stooped
kiss
her
hand
she
wished
love
him
son
but
felt
that
her
was
stranger
and
terrifying
man

the
countess
but
your
father

prince
andrew
true
that
natasha
still
young
but
long
that
unavoidable
said
prince
andrew
with
sigh
will
send

said
the
countess
and
left
the
room
lord
have
mercy
upon
she
repeated
while
seeking
her
daughter
sonya
said
that
natasha
was
her
bedroom
natasha
was
sitting
the
bed
pale
and
dry
eyed
and
was
gazing
the
icons
and
whispering
something
she
rapidly
crossed
herself
seeing
her
mother
she
jumped
and
flew
her
well
mamma
well
him
asking
for
your
hand
said
the
countess
coldly
seemed
natasha
said
the
mother
sadly
and
reproachfully
with
deep
sigh
her
daughter
ran
away
natasha
never
remembered
how
she
entered
the
drawing
room
when
she
came
and
saw
him
she
paused
possible
that
this
stranger
has
now
become
everything
she
asked
herself
and
immediately
answered
yes
everything
alone
now
dearer
than
everything
the
world
prince
andrew
came
her
with
downcast
eyes
have
loved
you
from
the
very
first
moment
saw
you
may
hope
looked
her
and
was
struck
the
serious
impassioned
expression
her
face
her
face
said
why
ask
why
doubt
what
you
cannot
but
know
why
speak
when
words
cannot
express
what
one
feels
she
drew
near
him
and
stopped
took
her
hand
and
kissed
you
love
yes
yes
natasha
murmured
vexation
then
she
sighed
loudly
and
catching
her
breath
more
and
more
quickly
began
sob
what
what
the
matter
happy
she
replied
smiled
through
her
tears
bent
over
closer
him
paused
for
instant
asking
herself
whether
she
might
and
then
kissed
him
prince
andrew
held
her
hands
looked
into
her
eyes
and
did
not
find
his
heart
his
former
love
for
her
something
him
had
suddenly
changed
there
was
longer
the
former
poetic
and
mystic
charm
desire
but
there
was
pity
for
her
feminine
and
childish
weakness
fear
her
devotion
and
trustfulness
and
oppressive
yet
joyful
sense
the
duty
that
now
bound
him
her
forever
the
present
feeling
though
not
bright
and
poetic
the
former
was
stronger
and
more
serious
did
your
mother
tell
you
that
cannot
for
year
asked
prince
andrew
still
looking
into
her
eyes
possible
that
the
chit
girl
everybody
called
thought
natasha
possible
that
now
the
wife
and
the
equal
this
strange
dear
clever
man
whom
even
father
looks
can
true
can
true
that
there
can
more
playing
with
life
that
now
grown
that
now
lies
responsibility
for
every
word
and
deed
yes
but
what
did
ask
she
replied
but
she
had
not
understood
his
question
forgive
said
but
you
are
young
and
have
already
been
through
much
life
afraid
for
you
you
not
yet
know
yourself
natasha
listened
with
concentrated
attention
trying
but
failing
take
the
meaning
his
words
hard
this
year
which
delays
happiness
will
continued
prince
andrew
will
give
you
time
sure
yourself
ask
you
make
happy
year
but
you
are
free
our
engagement
shall
remain
secret
and
should
you
find
that
you
not
love
should
you
come
love
said
prince
andrew
with
unnatural
smile
why
you
say
that
natasha
interrupted
him
you
know
that
from
the
very
day
you
first
came
otradnoe
have
loved
you
she
cried
quite
convinced
that
she
spoke
the
truth
year
you
will
learn
know
yourself
whole
year
natasha
repeated
suddenly
only
now
realizing
that
the
marriage
was
postponed
for
year
but
why
year
why
year
prince
andrew
began
explain
her
the
reasons
for
this
delay
natasha
did
not
hear
him
and
can
helped
she
asked
prince
andrew
did
not
reply
but
his
face
expressed
the
impossibility
altering
that
decision
awful
awful
awful
natasha
suddenly
cried
and
again
burst
into
sobs
shall
die
waiting
year
impossible
awful
she
looked
into
her
lover
face
and
saw
look
commiseration
and
perplexity
anything
she
said
suddenly
checking
her
tears
happy
the
father
and
mother
came
into
the
room
and
gave
the
betrothed
couple
their
blessing
from
that
day
prince
andrew
began
frequent
the
rostovs
natasha
affianced
lover
chapter
xxiv
betrothal
ceremony
took
place
and
natasha
engagement
bolkonski
was
not
announced
prince
andrew
insisted
that
said
that
was
responsible
for
the
delay
ought
bear
the
whole
burden
that
had
given
his
word
and
bound
himself
forever
but
that
did
not
wish
bind
natasha
and
gave
her
perfect
freedom
after
six
months
she
felt
that
she
did
not
love
him
she
would
have
full
right
reject
him
naturally
neither
natasha
nor
her
parents
wished
hear
this
but
prince
andrew
was
firm
came
every
day
the
rostovs
but
did
not
behave
natasha
affianced
lover
did
not
use
the
familiar
thou
but
said
you
her
and
kissed
only
her
hand
after
their
engagement
quite
different
intimate
and
natural
relations
sprang
between
them
was
they
had
not
known
each
other
till
now
both
liked
recall
how
they
had
regarded
each
other
when
yet
they
were
nothing
one
another
they
felt
themselves
now
quite
different
beings
then
they
were
artificial
now
natural
and
sincere
first
the
family
felt
some
constraint
intercourse
with
prince
andrew
seemed
man
from
another
world
and
for
long
time
natasha
trained
the
family
get
used
him
proudly
assuring
them
all
that
only
appeared
different
but
was
really
just
like
all
them
and
that
she
was
not
afraid
him
and
one
else
ought
after
few
days
they
grew
accustomed
him
and
without
restraint
his
presence
pursued
their
usual
way
life
which
took
his
part
could
talk
about
rural
economy
with
the
count
fashions
with
the
countess
and
natasha
and
about
albums
and
fancywork
with
sonya
sometimes
the
household
both
among
themselves
and
his
presence
expressed
their
wonder
how
had
all
happened
and
the
evident
omens
there
had
been
prince
andrew
coming
otradnoe
and
their
coming
petersburg
and
the
likeness
between
natasha
and
prince
andrew
which
her
nurse
had
noticed
his
first
visit
and
andrew
encounter
with
nicholas
and
many
other
incidents
betokening
that
had
the
house
that
poetic
dullness
and
quiet
reigned
which
always
accompanies
the
presence
betrothed
couple
often
when
all
sitting
together
everyone
kept
silent
sometimes
the
others
would
get
and
away
and
the
couple
left
alone
still
remained
silent
they
rarely
spoke
their
future
life
prince
andrew
was
afraid
and
ashamed
speak
natasha
shared
this
she
did
all
his
feelings
which
she
constantly
divined
once
she
began
questioning
him
about
his
son
prince
andrew
blushed
often
did
now
natasha
particularly
liked
him
and
said
that
his
son
would
not
live
with
them
why
not
asked
natasha
frightened
tone
cannot
take
him
away
from
his
grandfather
and
besides
how
should
have
loved
him
said
natasha
immediately
guessing
his
thought
but
know
you
wish
avoid
any
pretext
for
finding
fault
with
sometimes
the
old
count
would
come
kiss
prince
andrew
and
ask
his
advice
about
petya
education
nicholas
service
the
old
countess
sighed
she
looked
them
sonya
was
always
getting
frightened
lest
she
should
the
way
and
tried
find
excuses
for
leaving
them
alone
even
when
they
did
not
wish
when
prince
andrew
spoke
could
tell
story
very
well
natasha
listened
him
with
pride
when
she
spoke
she
noticed
with
fear
and
joy
that
gazed
attentively
and
scrutinizingly
her
she
asked
herself
perplexity
what
does
look
for
trying
discover
something
looking
what
what
seeks
not
there
sometimes
she
fell
into
one
the
mad
merry
moods
characteristic
her
and
then
she
particularly
loved
hear
and
see
how
prince
andrew
laughed
seldom
laughed
but
when
did
abandoned
himself
entirely
his
laughter
and
after
such
laugh
she
always
felt
nearer
him
natasha
would
have
been
completely
happy
the
thought
the
separation
awaiting
her
and
drawing
near
had
not
terrified
her
just
the
mere
thought
made
him
turn
pale
and
cold
the
eve
his
departure
from
petersburg
prince
andrew
brought
with
him
pierre
who
had
not
been
the
rostovs
once
since
the
ball
pierre
seemed
disconcerted
and
embarrassed
was
talking
the
countess
and
natasha
sat
down
beside
little
chess
table
with
sonya
thereby
inviting
prince
andrew
come
too
did
you
have
known
bezukhov
long
time
asked
you
like
him
yes
dear
but
very
absurd
and
usual
when
speaking
pierre
she
began
tell
anecdotes
his
absent
mindedness
some
which
had
even
been
invented
about
him
you
know
have
entrusted
him
with
our
secret
have
known
him
from
childhood
has
heart
gold
beg
you
natalie
prince
andrew
said
with
sudden
seriousness
going
away
and
heaven
knows
what
may
happen
you
may
cease
all
right
know
not
say
that
only
this
then
whatever
may
happen
you
when
not
here
what
can
happen
whatever
trouble
may
come
prince
andrew
continued
beg
you
mademoiselle
sophie
whatever
may
happen
turn
him
alone
for
advice
and
help
most
absent
minded
and
absurd
fellow
but
has
heart
gold
neither
her
father
nor
her
mother
nor
sonya
nor
prince
andrew
himself
could
have
foreseen
how
the
separation
from
her
lover
would
act
natasha
flushed
and
agitated
she
went
about
the
house
all
that
day
dry
eyed
occupied
with
most
trivial
matters
not
understanding
what
awaited
her
she
did
not
even
cry
when
taking
leave
kissed
her
hand
for
the
last
time
don
she
said
tone
that
made
him
wonder
whether
really
ought
not
stay
and
which
remembered
long
afterwards
nor
did
she
cry
when
was
gone
but
for
several
days
she
sat
her
room
dry
eyed
taking
interest
anything
and
only
saying
now
and
then
why
did
away
but
fortnight
after
his
departure
the
surprise
those
around
her
she
recovered
from
her
mental
sickness
just
suddenly
and
became
her
old
self
again

change

that
she

during
the

prince
andrew
had
come
bald
hills
and
had
been
gay
gentle
and
more
affectionate
than
princess
mary
had
known
him
for
long
time
past
she
felt
that
something
had
happened
him
but
said
nothing
her
about
his
love
before
left
had
long
talk
with
his
father
about
something
and
princess
mary
noticed
that
before
his
departure
they
were
dissatisfied
with
one
another
soon
after
prince
andrew
had
gone
princess
mary
wrote
her
friend
julie
karagina

whom
she
had
dreamed
all
girls
dream
marrying
her
brother
and
who
was
that
time
mourning
for
her
own
brother
killed
turkey
sorrow
seems
our
common
lot
dear
tender
friend
julie
your
loss
terrible
that
can
only
explain
myself
special
providence
god
who
loving
you
wishes
try
you
and
your
excellent
mother
friend
religion
and
religion
alone
can
will
not
say
comfort
but
save
from
despair
religion
alone
can
explain
what
without
its
help
man
cannot
comprehend
why
for
what
cause
kind
and
noble
beings
able
find
happiness
life
not
merely
harming
one
but
necessary
the
happiness
others
are
called
away
god
while
cruel
useless
harmful
persons
such
are
burden
themselves
and
others
are
left
living
the
first
death
saw
and
one
shall
never
forget
that
dear
sister
law
left
that
impression
just
you
ask
destiny
why
your
splendid
brother
had
die
asked
why
that
angel
lise
who
not
only
never
wronged
anyone
but
whose
soul
there
were
never
any
unkind
thoughts
had
die
and
what
you
think
dear
friend
five
years
have
passed
since
then
and
already
with
petty
understanding
begin
see
clearly
why
she
had
die
and
what
way
that
death
was
but
expression
the
infinite
goodness
the
creator
whose
every
action
though
generally
incomprehensible
but
manifestation
his
infinite
love
for
his
creatures
perhaps
often
think
she
was
too
angelically
innocent
have
the
strength
perform
all
mother
duties
young
wife
she
was
irreproachable
perhaps
she
could
not
have
been
mother
not
only
has
she
left
and
particularly
prince
andrew
with
the
purest
regrets
and
memories
but
probably
she
will
there
receive
place
dare
not
hope
for
myself
but
not
speak
her
alone
that
early
and
terrible
death
has
had
the
most
beneficent
influence
and
brother
spite
all
our
grief
then
the
moment
our
loss
these
thoughts
could
not
occur
should
then
have
dismissed
them
with
horror
but
now
they
are
very
clear
and
certain
write
all
this
you
dear
friend
only
convince
you
the
gospel
truth
which
has
become
for
principle
life
not
single
hair
our
heads
will
fall
without
his
will
and
his
will
governed
only
infinite
love
for
and
whatever
befalls
for
our
good
you
ask
whether
shall
spend
next
winter
moscow
spite
wish
see
you
not
think
and
not
want
you
will
surprised
hear
that
the
reason
for
this
buonaparte
the
case
this
father
health
growing
noticeably
worse
cannot
stand
any
contradiction
and
becoming
irritable
this
irritability
you
know
chiefly
directed
political
questions
cannot
endure
the
notion
that
buonaparte
negotiating
equal
terms
with
all
the
sovereigns
europe
and
particularly
with
our
own
the
grandson
the
great
catherine
you
know
quite
indifferent
politics
but
from
father
remarks
and
his
talks
with
michael
ivanovich
know
all
that
goes
the
world
and
especially
about
the
honors
conferred
buonaparte
who
only
bald
hills
the
whole
world
seems
not
accepted
great
man
still
less
emperor
france
and
father
cannot
stand
this
seems
that
chiefly
because
his
political
views
that
father
reluctant
speak
going
moscow
for
foresees
the
encounters
that
would
result
from
his
way
expressing
his
views
regardless
anybody
all
the
benefit
might
derive
from
course
treatment
would
lose
result
the
disputes
about
buonaparte
which
would
inevitable
any
case
will
decided
very
shortly
our
family
life
goes
the
old
way
except
for
brother
andrew
absence
wrote
you
before
has
changed
very
much
late
after
his
sorrow
only
this
year
quite
recovered
his
spirits
has
again
become
used
know
him
when
child
kind
affectionate
with
that
heart
gold
which
know
equal
has
realized
seems
that
life
not
over
for
him
but
together
with
this
mental
change
has
grown
physically
much
weaker
has
become
thinner
and
more
nervous
anxious
about
him
and
glad
taking
this
trip
abroad
which
the
doctors
recommended
long
ago
hope
will
cure
him
you

that

the
report
brother
betrothal
the
little

not
think
brother
will
ever

and
certainly
not

and
this
why
first
know
that
though
rarely
speaks
about
the
wife
has
lost
the
grief
that
loss
has
gone
too
deep
his
heart
for
him
ever
decide
give
her
successor
and
our
little
angel

secondly
because
far
know
that
girl
not
the
kind
girl
who
could
please

not

him
for
not
having
told
her
his
resolve
when
had
last
visited
bald
hills
though
had
spoken
his
father
had
not
done
for
fear
princess
mary
should
ask
her
father
give
his
consent
irritating
him
and
having
bear
the
brunt
his
displeasure
without
attaining
her

and
now
already
six

three
months

nothing

been
and
always
shall
independent
but
against
his
will
and
arouse
his
anger
now
that

perhaps
remain
with
such
short
time
would
destroy
half
happiness
now
writing
him
about
the
same
question
and
beg
you
choose
good
moment

letter
and
let

whole
matter
and
whether

months
after

and

the
princess

about

out
into
the
frost
the

the
frost
after
this
outburst
the
prince
did
not
speak
any
more
about
the
matter
but
repressed
vexation
his
son
poor
spirited
behavior
found
expression
his
treatment
his
daughter
his
former
pretexts
for
irony
fresh
one
was
now
added
allusions
stepmothers
and
amiabilities
mademoiselle
bourienne
why
shouldn
marry
her
asked
his
daughter
she
make
splendid
princess
and
latterly
her
surprise
and
bewilderment
princess
mary
noticed
that
her
father
was
really
associating
more
and
more
with
the
frenchwoman
she
wrote
prince
andrew
about
the
reception
his
letter
but
comforted
him
with
hopes
reconciling
their
father
the
idea
little
nicholas
and
his
education
her
brother
andrew
and
religion
were
princess
mary
joys
and
consolations
but
besides
that
since
everyone
must
have
personal
hopes
princess
mary
the
profoundest
depths
her
heart
had
hidden
dream
and
hope
that
supplied
the
chief
consolation
her
life
this
comforting
dream
and
hope
were
given
her
god
folk
the
half
witted
and
other
pilgrims
who
visited
her
without
the
prince
knowledge
the
longer
she
lived
the
more
experience
and
observation
she
had
life
the
greater
was
her
wonder
the
short
sightedness
men
who
seek
enjoyment
and
happiness
here
earth
toiling
suffering
struggling
and
harming
one
another
obtain
that
impossible
visionary
sinful
happiness
prince
andrew
had
loved
his
wife
she
died
but
that
was
not
enough
wanted
bind
his
happiness
another
woman
her
father
objected
this
because
wanted
more
distinguished
and
wealthier
match
for
andrew
and
they
all
struggled
and
suffered
and
tormented
one
another
and
injured
their
souls
their
eternal
souls
for
the
attainment
benefits
which
endure
but
for
instant
not
only
know
this
ourselves
but
christ
the
son
god
came
down
earth
and
told
that
this
life
but
for
moment
and
probation
yet
cling
and
think
find
happiness
how
that
one
realizes
this
thought
princess
mary
one
except
these
despised
god
folk
who
wallet
back
come
the
back
door
afraid
being
seen
the
prince
not
for
fear
ill
usage
him
but
for
fear
causing
him
sin
leave
family
home
and
all
the
cares
worldly
welfare
order
without
clinging
anything
wander
hempen
rags
from
place
place
under
assumed
name
doing
one
any
harm
but
praying
for
all
for
those
who
drive
one
away
well
for
those
who
protect
one
higher
than
that
life
and
truth
there
life
truth
there
was
one
pilgrim
quiet
pockmarked
little
woman
fifty
called
theodosia
who
for
over
thirty
years
had
gone
about
barefoot
and
worn
heavy
chains
princess
mary
was
particularly
fond
her
once
when
room
with
lamp
dimly
lit
before
the
icon
theodosia
was
talking
her
life
the
thought
that
theodosia
alone
had
found
the
true
path
life
suddenly
came
princess
mary
with
such
force
that
she
resolved
become
pilgrim
herself
when
theodosia
had
gone
sleep
princess
mary
thought
about
this
for
long
time
and
last
made
her
mind
that
strange
might
seem
she
must
pilgrimage
she
disclosed
this
thought
one
but
her
confessor
father
akinfi
the
monk
and
approved
her
intention
under
guise
present
for
the
pilgrims
princess
mary
prepared
pilgrim
complete
costume
for
herself
coarse
smock
bast
shoes
rough
coat
and
black
kerchief
often
approaching
the
chest
drawers
containing
this
secret
treasure
princess
mary
paused
uncertain
whether
the
time
had
not
already
come
put
her
project
into
execution
often
listening
the
pilgrims
tales
she
was
stimulated
their
simple
speech
mechanical
them
but
her
full
deep
meaning
that
several
times
she
was
the
point
abandoning
everything
and
running
away
from
home
imagination
she
already
pictured
herself
theodosia
side
dressed
coarse
rags
walking
with
staff
wallet
her
back
along
the
dusty
road
directing
her
wanderings
from
one
saint
shrine
another
free
from
envy
earthly
love
desire
and
reaching
last
the
place
where
there
more
sorrow
sighing
but
eternal
joy
and
bliss
shall
come
place
and
pray
there
and
before
having
time
get
used
getting
love
shall
farther
will
till
legs
fail
and
lie
down
and
die
somewhere
and
shall
last
reach
that
eternal
quiet
haven
where
there
neither
sorrow
nor
sighing
thought
princess
mary
but
afterwards
when
she
saw
her
father
and
especially
little
koko
nicholas
her
resolve
weakened
she
wept
quietly
and
felt
that
she
was
sinner
who
loved
her
father
and
little
nephew

than

nicholas
rostov
experienced
this
blissful
condition
the
full
when
after
continued
serve
the
pavlograd
regiment
which
already
commanded
the
squadron
had
taken
over
from
denisov
rostov
had
become
bluff
good
natured
fellow
whom
his
moscow
acquaintances
would
have
considered
rather
bad
form
but
who
was
liked
and
respected
his
comrades
subordinates
and
superiors
and
was
well
contented
with
his
life
late
found
letters
from
home
more
frequent
complaints
from
his
mother
that
their
affairs
were
falling
into
greater
and
greater
disorder
and
that
was
time
for
him
come
back
gladden
and
comfort
his
old
parents
reading
these
letters
nicholas
felt
dread
their
wanting
take
him
away
from
surroundings
which
protected
from
all
the
entanglements
life
was
living
calmly
and
quietly
felt
that
sooner
later
would
have
enter
that
whirlpool
life
with
its
embarrassments
and
affairs
straightened
out
its
accounts
with
stewards
quarrels
and
intrigues
its
ties
society
and
with
sonya
love
and
his
promise
her
was
all
dreadfully
difficult
and
complicated
and
replied
his
mother
cold
formal
letters
french
beginning
dear
mamma
and
ending
your
obedient
son
which
said
nothing
when
would
return

letters
from
his
parents
which
they
told
him
natasha

and
that
the
wedding
would
year
time
because
the
old
prince
made
difficulties
this
letter
grieved
and
mortified
nicholas
the
first
place
was
sorry
that
natasha
for
whom
cared
more
than
for
anyone
else
the
family
should
lost
the
home
and
secondly
from
his
hussar
point
view
regretted
not
have
been
there
show
that
fellow
bolkonski
that
connection
with
him
was
such
great
honor
after
all
and
that
loved
natasha
might
dispense
with
permission
from
his
dotard
father
for
moment
hesitated
whether
should
not
apply
for
leave
order
see
natasha
before
she
was
married
but
then
came
the
maneuvers
and
considerations
about
sonya
and
about
the
confusion
their
affairs
and
nicholas
again
put
off
but
the
spring
that
year
received
letter
from
his
mother
written
without
his
father
knowledge
and
that
letter
persuaded
him
return
she
wrote
that
did
not
come
and
take
matters
hand
their
whole
property
would
sold
auction
and
they
would
all
have
begging
the
count
was
weak
and
trusted
mitenka
much
and
was
good
natured
that
everybody
took
advantage
him
and
things
were
going
from
bad
worse
for
god
sake
implore
you
come
once

the
whole

that
common

which
showed
him
what
ought
the
right
thing
now
was
not
retire
from
the
service
any

after
his

with

his
comrades
who
turned
the
evening
that
was
applying
for

was
going

difficult
and
strange
was
for
him
reflect
that
would

this
interested
him
extremely
whether
was
promoted

receive

strange
was
think
that
would

this
good
bright
world
somewhere
where
everything
was
stupid
and
confused
week
later
obtained
his
leave
his
hussar
comrades
not
only
those
his
own
regiment
but
the
whole
brigade
gave
rostov
dinner
which
the
subscription
was
fifteen
rubles
head
and
which
there
were
two
bands
and
two
choirs
singers
rostov
danced
the
trepak
with
major
basov
the
tipsy
officers
tossed
embraced
and
dropped
rostov
the
soldiers
the
third
squadron
tossed
him
too
and
shouted
hurrah
and
then
they
put
him
his
sleigh
and
escorted
him
far
the
first
post
station
during
the
first
half
the
journey
from
kremenchug
kiev
all
rostov
thoughts
usual
such
cases
were
behind
him
with
the
squadron
but
when
had
gone
more
than
halfway
began
forget
his
three
roans
and
dozhoyveyko
his
quartermaster
and
wonder
anxiously
how
things
would
otradnoe
and
what
would
find
there
thoughts
home
grew
stronger
the
nearer
approached
far
stronger
though
this
feeling
his
was
subject
the
law
which
the
force
attraction
inverse
proportion
the
square
the
distance
the
last
post
station
before
otradnoe
gave
the
driver
three
ruble
tip
and
arriving
ran
breathlessly
like
boy
the
steps
his
home
after
the
rapture
meeting
and
after
that
odd
feeling
unsatisfied
expectation
the
feeling
that
everything
just
the
same
why
did
hurry
nicholas
began
settle
down
his
old
home
world
his
father
and
mother
were
much
the
same
only
little
older
what
was
new
them
was
certain
uneasiness
and
occasional
discord
which
there
used
not
and
which
nicholas
soon
found
out
was
due
the
bad
state
their
affairs
sonya
was
nearly
twenty
she
had
stopped
growing
prettier
and
promised
nothing
more
than
she
was
already
but
that
was
enough
she
exhaled
happiness
and
love
from
the
time
nicholas
returned
and
the
faithful
unalterable
love
this
girl
had
gladdening
effect
him
petya
and
natasha
surprised
nicholas
most
petya
was
big
handsome
boy
thirteen
merry
witty
and
mischievous
with
voice
that
was
already
breaking
for
natasha
for
long
while
nicholas
wondered
and
laughed
whenever
looked
her
you
not
the
same
all
said
how
uglier
the
contrary
but
what
dignity
princess
whispered
her
yes
yes
yes
cried
natasha
joyfully
she
told
him
about
her
romance
with
prince
andrew
and
his
visit
otradnoe
and
showed
him
his
last
letter
well
are
you
glad
natasha
asked
tranquil
and
happy
now
very
glad
answered
nicholas
excellent
fellow
and
are
you
very
much
love
how
shall
put
replied
natasha
was
love
with
boris
with
teacher
and
with
denisov
but
this
quite
different
feel
peace
and
settled
know
that
better
man
than
exists
and
calm
and
contented
now
not
all
before
nicholas
expressed
his
disapproval
the
postponement
the
marriage
for
year
but
natasha
attacked
her
brother
with
exasperation
proving
him
that
could
not
otherwise
and
that
would
bad
thing
enter
family
against
the
father
will
and
that
she
herself
wished
you
don
all
understand
she
said
nicholas
was
silent
and
agreed
with
her
her
brother
often
wondered
looked
her
she
did
not
seem
all
like
girl
love
and
parted
from
her
affianced
husband
she
was
even
tempered
and
calm
and
quite
cheerful
old
this
amazed
nicholas
and
even
made
him
regard
bolkonski
courtship
skeptically
could
not
believe
that
her
fate
was
sealed
especially
had
not
seen
her
with
prince
andrew
always
seemed
him
that
there
was
something
not
quite
right
about
this
intended
marriage
why
this
delay
why
betrothal
thought
once
when
had
touched
this
topic
with
his
mother
discovered
his
surprise
and
somewhat
his
satisfaction
that
the
depth
her
soul
she
too
had
doubts
about
this
marriage
you
see
writes
said
she
showing
her

with
that
latent
grudge
mother
always
has

what
can
keeping

illness
probably
his
health
very
delicate
don
tell
natasha
and
don
attach
importance
her
being
bright
that
because
she
living
through
the
last
days
her
girlhood
but
know
what
she
like
every
time
receive
letter
from
him
however
god
grant
that
everything
turns
out
well
she
always
ended
with
these
words
excellent
man
chapter
after
reaching
home
nicholas
was
first
serious
and
even
dull
was
worried
the
impending
necessity
interfering
the
stupid
business
matters
for
which
his
mother
had
called
him
home
throw
off
this
burden
quickly
possible
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
went
angry
and
scowling
and
without
answering
questions
where
was
going
mitenka
lodge
and
demanded
account
everything
but
what
account
everything
might
nicholas
knew
even
less
than
the
frightened
and
bewildered
mitenka
the
conversation
and
the
examination
the
accounts
with
mitenka
did
not
last
long
the
village
elder
peasant
delegate
and
the
village
clerk
who
were
waiting
the
passage
heard
with
fear
and
delight
first
the
young
count
voice
roaring
and
snapping
and
rising
louder
and
louder
and
then
words
abuse
dreadful
words
ejaculated
one
after
the
other
robber
ungrateful
wretch
hack
the
dog
pieces
not
father
robbing
and
then
with
less
fear
and
delight
they
saw
how
the
young
count
red
the
face
and
with
bloodshot
eyes
dragged
mitenka
out
the
scruff
the
neck
and
applied
his
foot
and
knee
his
behind
with
great
agility
convenient
moments
between
the
words
shouting
off
never
let
see
your
face
here
again
you
villain
mitenka
flew
headlong
down
the
six
steps
and
ran
away
into
the
shrubbery
this
shrubbery
was
well
known
haven
refuge
for
culprits
otradnoe
mitenka
himself
returning
tipsy
from
the
town
used
hide
there
and
many
the
residents
otradnoe
hiding
from
mitenka
knew
its
protective
qualities
mitenka
wife
and
sisters
law
thrust
their
heads
and
frightened
faces
out
the
door
room
where
bright
samovar
was
boiling
and
where
the
steward
high
bedstead
stood
with
its
patchwork
quilt
the
young
count
paid
heed
them
but
breathing
hard
passed
with
resolute
strides
and
went
into
the
house
the
countess
who
heard
once
from
the
maids
what
had
happened
the
lodge
was
calmed
the
thought
that
now
their
affairs
would
certainly
improve
but
the
other
hand
felt
anxious
the
effect
this
excitement
might
have
her
son
she
went
several
times
his
door
tiptoe
and
listened
lighted
one
pipe
after
another
next
day
the
old
count
called
his
son
aside
and
with
embarrassed
smile
said
him
but
you
know
dear
boy
pity

got
excited
mitenka
has
told
all

thought
nicholas
that

that

they
were

dear
boy
the
count
too
felt
embarrassed

mismanaged
his
wife

and
was
blame
toward
his
children
but
did
not
know
how

but

page

all
said
himself
and
after
that
did
not
meddle
business
affairs
but
once
the
countess
called
her
son
and
informed
him
that
she
had
promissory
note
from
anna
mikhaylovna
for
two
thousand
rubles
and
asked
him
what
thought

answered
nicholas

our
friends

then
this
and
tore
the
note
and
doing
caused
the
old
countess
weep
tears
joy
after
that
young
rostov
took
further
part
any
business
affairs
but
devoted
himself
with
passionate
enthusiasm
what
was
him
new
pursuit
the
chase
for
which
his
father
kept
large
establishment

and

saturated
autumn
rains
the
verdure
had
thickened
and
its
bright
green
stood
out
sharply
against
the
brownish
strips
winter
rye
trodden
down
the
cattle
and
against
the
pale
yellow
stubble
the
spring
buckwheat
the
wooded
ravines
and
the

which
the

that
ardent
young
sportsman
rostov
had
not
merely
reached
hard
winter
condition
but
were
jaded
that
meeting
the
huntsmen
was
decided
give
them
three
days
rest
and
then
the
sixteenth
september
distant
expedition
starting
from
the
oak
grove
where
there
was
undisturbed
litter
wolf
cubs
all
that
day
the
hounds
remained
home
was
frosty
and
the
air
was
sharp
but
toward
evening
the
sky
became
overcast
and
began
thaw
the
fifteenth
when
young
rostov
his
dressing
gown
looked
out

window
saw

unsurpassable
morning
for
hunting
was
the

melting
and
sinking
the

without
any

the
only
motion
the
air
was
that
the
dripping
microscopic
particles
drizzling
mist
the
bare
twigs
the
garden
were
hung
with
transparent
drops
which
fell
the
freshly
fallen
leaves
the
earth
the
kitchen
garden
looked
wet
and
black
and
glistened
like
poppy
seed
and
short
distance
merged
into
the
dull
moist
veil
mist
nicholas
went
out
into
the
wet
and
muddy
porch
there
was
smell
decaying
leaves
and
dog

with
prominent
black

got
seeing
her

then
suddenly
jumped
and
licked
him
right

nose
and
mustache
another
borzoi
dog
catching
sight
his
master
from
the
garden
path
arched
his
back
and
rushing
headlong
toward
the
porch
with
lifted
tail
began
rubbing
himself
against
his
legs
hoy
came
that
moment
that
inimitable
huntsman
call
which
unites
the
deepest
bass
with
the
shrillest
tenor
and
round
the
corner
came
daniel

and
scorn
everything
that
only

was
not
offensive

timidly
conscious
the
sight

previous
resolutions

said
the
huntsman

and
two
flashing
black
eyes
gazed
from
under
his
brows

for
the
still

distinctly
caught
the
music
the
hunt
with
only
two
three
hounds
giving
tongue
bent
down
his
head
and
listened
shaking

his

they
are
the

whispered
straight
the
lyadov
uplands
the
count
forgetting
smooth
out
the
smile
his
face
looked
into
the
distance
straight
before
him
down
the
narrow
open
space
holding
the
snuffbox
his
hand
but
not
taking
any
after
the
cry
the
hounds
came
the
deep
tones
the
wolf
call
from
daniel
hunting
horn
the
pack
joined
the
first
three
hounds
and
they
could
heard
full
cry
with
that
peculiar
lift
the
note
that
indicates
that
they
are
after
wolf
the
whippers
longer
set
the
hounds
but
changed
the
cry
ulyulyu
and
above
the
others
rose
daniel
voice
now
deep
bass
now
piercingly
shrill
his
voice
seemed
fill
the
whole
wood
and
carried
far
beyond
out
into
the
open
field
after
listening
few
moments
silence
the
count
and
his
attendant
convinced
themselves
that
the
hounds
had
separated
into
two
packs
the
sound
the
larger
pack
eagerly
giving
tongue
began
die
away
the
distance
the
other
pack
rushed
the
wood
past
the
count
and
was
with
this
that
daniel
voice
was
heard
calling
ulyulyu
the
sounds
both
packs
mingled
and
broke
apart
again
but
both
were
becoming
more
distant
simon
sighed
and
stooped
straighten
the
leash
young
borzoi
had
entangled
the
count
too
sighed
and
noticing
the
snuffbox
his
hand
opened
and
took
pinch
back
cried
simon
borzoi
that
was
pushing
forward
out
the
wood
the
count
started
and
dropped
the
snuffbox
nastasya
ivanovna
dismounted
pick
the
count
and
simon
were
looking
him
then
unexpectedly
often
happens
the
sound
the
hunt
suddenly
approached
the
hounds
full
cry
and
daniel
ulyulyuing
were
just
front
them
the
count
turned
and
saw
his
right
mitka
staring
him
with
eyes
starting
out
his
head
raising
his
cap
and
pointing
before
him
the
other
side
look
out
shouted
voice
plainly
showing
that
had
long
fretted
utter
that
word
and
letting
the
borzois
slip
galloped
toward
the
count
the
count
and
simon
galloped
out
the
wood
and
saw
their
left
wolf
which
softly
swaying
from
side
side
was
coming
quiet
lope
farther
the
left
the
very
place
where
they
were
standing
the
angry
borzois
whined
and
getting
free
the
leash
rushed
past
the
horses
feet
the
wolf
the
wolf
paused
turned
its
heavy
forehead
toward
the
dogs
awkwardly
like
man
suffering
from
the
quinsy
and
still
slightly
swaying
from
side
side
gave
couple
leaps
and
with
swish
its
tail
disappeared
into
the
skirt
the
wood
the
same
instant
with
cry
like
wail
first
one
hound
then
another
and
then
another
sprang
helter
skelter
from
the
wood
opposite
and
the
whole
pack
rushed
across
the
field
toward
the
very
spot
where
the
wolf
had
disappeared
the
hazel
bushes
parted
behind
the
hounds
and
daniel
chestnut
horse
appeared
dark
with
sweat
its
long
back
sat
daniel
hunched
forward
capless
his
disheveled
gray
hair
hanging
over
his
flushed
perspiring
face
ulyulyulyu
ulyulyu
cried
when
caught
sight
the
count
his
eyes
flashed
lightning
blast
you
shouted
holding
his
whip
threateningly
the
count
you
let
the
wolf
what
sportsmen
and
scorning
say
more
the
frightened
and
shamefaced
count
lashed
the
heaving
flanks
his
sweating
chestnut
gelding
with
all
the
anger
the
count
had
aroused
and
flew
off
after
the
hounds
the
count
like
punished
schoolboy
looked
round
trying
smile
win
simon
sympathy
for
his
plight
but
simon
was
longer
there
was
galloping
round
the
bushes
while
the
field
was
coming
both
sides
all
trying
head
the
wolf
but
vanished
into
the
wood
before

could
chapter
nicholas
rostov
meanwhile
remained
his
post
waiting
for
the
wolf
the
way
the
hunt
approached
and
receded
the
cries
the
dogs
whose
notes
were
familiar
him
the
way
the
voices
the
huntsmen
approached
receded
and
rose
realized
what
was
happening
the
copse
knew
that
young
and
old
wolves
were
there
that
the
hounds
had
separated
into
two
packs
that
somewhere
wolf
was
being
chased
and
that
something
had
gone
wrong
expected
the
wolf
come
his
way
any
moment
made
thousands
different
conjectures
where
and
from
what
side
the
beast
would
come
and
how
would
set
upon
hope
alternated
with
despair
several
times
addressed
prayer
god
that
the

should
come
his

and

arising
from
trivial
causes
what
would
thee
this
for

know
thou

ask
this
thee
but
for
god
sake
let
the

come
way
and
let

spring

uncle
who
watching
from
over
there
and
seize
the

death
grip
thousand
times
during
that
half
hour
rostov
cast
eager
and
restless
glances
over
the
edge
the
wood
with
the
two
scraggy
oaks
rising
above
the
aspen
undergrowth
and
the
gully
with
its
water
worn
side
and

cap
just
visible
above
the

his

yet
what

everywhere
cards
and

always
unlucky
memories
austerlitz
and
dolokhov
flashed
rapidly
and
clearly
through
his

only
once
life
get
old

want
only
that
thought
straining
eyes
and
ears
and
looking
the
left
and
then
the
right
and
listening
the
slightest
variation
note
the
cries
the
dogs
again
looked
the
right
and
saw
something
running
toward
him
across
the
deserted
field
can
thought
rostov
taking
deep
breath
man
does
the
coming
something
long
hoped
for
the
height
happiness
was
reached
and
simply
without
warning
noise
display
that
rostov
could
not
believe
his
eyes
and
remained
doubt
for
over
second
the
wolf
ran
forward
and
jumped
heavily
over
gully
that
lay
her
path
she
was
old
animal
with
gray
back
and
big
reddish
belly
she
ran
without
hurry
evidently
feeling
sure
that
one
saw
her
rostov
holding
his
breath
looked
round
the
borzois
they
stood
lay
not
seeing
the
wolf
understanding
the
situation
old
karay
had
turned
his
head
and
was
angrily
searching
for
fleas
baring
his
yellow
teeth
and
snapping
his
hind
legs
ulyulyulyu
whispered
rostov
pouting
his
lips
the
borzois
jumped
jerking
the
rings
the
leashes
and
pricking
their
ears
karay
finished
scratching
his
hindquarters
and
cocking
his
ears
got
with
quivering
tail
from
which
tufts
matted
hair
hung
down
shall
loose
them
not
nicholas
asked
himself
the
wolf
approached
him
coming
from
the
copse
suddenly
the
wolf
whole
physiognomy
changed
she
shuddered
seeing
what
she
had
probably
never
seen
before
human
eyes
fixed
upon
her
and
turning
her
head
little
toward
rostov
she
paused
back
forward
matter
forward
the
wolf
seemed
say
herself
and
she
moved
forward
without
again
looking
round
and
with
quiet
long
easy
yet
resolute
lope
ulyulyu
cried
nicholas
voice
not
his
own
and
its
own
accord
his
good
horse
darted
headlong
downhill
leaping
over
gullies
head
off
the
wolf
and
the
borzois
passed
running
faster
still
nicholas
did
not
hear
his
own
cry
nor
feel
that
was
galloping
nor
see
the
borzois
nor
the
ground
over
which
went
saw
only
the
wolf
who
increasing
her
speed
bounded
the
same
direction
along
the
hollow
the
first
come
into
view
was
milka
with
her
black
markings
and
powerful
quarters
gaining
upon
the
wolf
nearer
and
nearer
now
she
was
ahead
but
the
wolf
turned
its
head
face
her
and
instead
putting
speed
she
usually
did
milka
suddenly
raised
her
tail
and
stiffened
her
forelegs
ulyulyulyulyu
shouted
nicholas
the
reddish
lyubim
rushed
forward
from
behind
milka
sprang
impetuously
the
wolf
and
seized
its
hindquarters
but
immediately
jumped
aside
terror
the
wolf
crouched
gnashed
her
teeth
and
again
rose
and
bounded
forward
followed
the
distance
couple
feet
all
the
borzois
who
did
not
get
any
closer
her
she
get
away
impossible
thought
nicholas
still
shouting
with
hoarse
voice
karay
ulyulyu
shouted
looking
round
for
the
old
borzoi
who
was
now
his
only
hope
karay
with
all
the
strength
age
had
left
him
stretched
himself
the
utmost
and
watching
the
wolf
galloped
heavily
aside
intercept
but
the
quickness
the
wolf
lope
and
the
borzoi
slower
pace
made
plain
that
karay
had
miscalculated
nicholas
could
already
see
not
far
front
him
the
wood
where
the
wolf
would
certainly
escape
should
she
reach
but
coming
toward
him
saw
hounds
and
huntsman
galloping
almost
straight
the
wolf
there
was
still
hope
long
yellowish
young
borzoi
one
nicholas
did
not
know
from
another
leash
rushed
impetuously
the
wolf
from
front
and
almost
knocked
her
over
but
the
wolf
jumped
more
quickly
than
anyone
could
have
expected
and
gnashing
her
teeth
flew
the
yellowish
borzoi
which
with
piercing
yelp
fell
with
its
head
the
ground
bleeding
from
gash
its
side
karay
old
fellow
wailed
nicholas
thanks
the
delay
caused
this
crossing
the
wolf
path
the
old
dog
with
its
felted
hair
hanging
from
its
thigh
was
within
five
paces
aware
her
danger
the
wolf
turned
her
eyes
karay
tucked
her
tail
yet
further
between
her
legs
and
increased
her
speed
but
here
nicholas
only
saw
that
something
happened
karay
the
borzoi
was
suddenly
the
wolf
and
they
rolled
together
down
into
gully
just
front
them
that
instant
when
nicholas
saw
the
wolf
struggling
the
gully
with
the
dogs
while
from
under
them
could
seen
her
gray
hair
and
outstretched
hind
leg
and
her
frightened
choking
head
with
her
ears
laid
back
karay
was
pinning
her
the
throat
was
the
happiest
moment
his
life
with
his
hand
his
saddlebow
was
ready
dismount
and
stab
the
wolf
when
she
suddenly
thrust
her
head
from
among
that
mass
dogs
and
then
her
forepaws
were
the
edge
the
gully
she
clicked
her
teeth
karay
longer
had
her
the
throat
leaped
with
movement
her
hind
legs
out
the
gully
and
having
disengaged
herself
from
the
dogs
with
tail
tucked
again
went
forward
karay
his
hair
bristling
and
probably
bruised
wounded
climbed
with
difficulty
out
the
gully
god
why
nicholas
cried
despair
uncle
huntsman
was
galloping
from
the
other
side
across
the
wolf
path
and
his
borzois
once
more
stopped
the
animal
advance
she
was
again
hemmed
nicholas
and
his
attendant
with
uncle
and
his
huntsman
were
all
riding
round
the
wolf
crying
ulyulyu
shouting
and
preparing
dismount
each
moment
that
the
wolf
crouched
back
and
starting
forward
again
every
time
she
shook
herself
and
moved
toward
the
wood
where
she
would
safe
already
the
beginning
this
chase
daniel
hearing
the
ulyulyuing
had
rushed
out
from
the
wood
saw
karay
seize
the
wolf
and
checked
his
horse
supposing
the
affair
over
but
when
saw
that
the
horsemen
did
not
dismount
and
that
the
wolf
shook
herself
and
ran
for
safety
daniel
set
his
chestnut
galloping
not
the
wolf
but
straight
toward
the
wood
just
karay
had
run
cut
the
animal
off
result
this
galloped
the
wolf
just
when
she
had
been
stopped
second
time
uncle
borzois
daniel
galloped
silently
holding
naked
dagger
his
left
hand
and
thrashing
the
laboring
sides
his
chestnut
horse
with
his
whip
were
flail
nicholas
neither
saw
nor
heard
daniel
until
the
chestnut
breathing
heavily
panted
past
him
and
heard
the
fall
body
and
saw
daniel
lying
the
wolf
back
among
the
dogs
trying
seize
her
the
ears
was
evident
the
dogs
the
hunters
and
the
wolf
herself
that
all
was
now
over
the
terrified
wolf
pressed
back
her
ears
and
tried
rise
but
the
borzois
stuck
her
daniel
rose
little
took
step
and
with
his
whole
weight
lying
down
rest
fell
the
wolf
seizing
her
the
ears
nicholas
was
about
stab
her
but
daniel
whispered
don
gag
her
and
changing
his
position
set
his
foot
the
wolf
neck
stick
was
thrust
between
her
jaws
and
she
was
fastened
with
leash

chapter
the
old

went
home
and
natasha
and
petya
promised

very
soon
but
was
still
early
the
hunt
went
farther
midday
they
put
the
hounds
into
ravine
thickly
overgrown
with
young
trees
nicholas
standing
fallow
field
could
see
all
his
whips
facing
him
lay
field
winter
rye
there
his
own
huntsman
stood
alone
hollow
behind
hazel
bush
the
hounds
had
scarcely
been
loosed
before
nicholas
heard
one
knew
voltorn
giving
tongue
intervals
other
hounds
joined
now
pausing
and
now
again
giving
tongue
moment
later
heard
cry
from
the
wooded
ravine
that
fox
had
been
found
and
the
whole
pack
joining
together
rushed
along
the
ravine
toward
the
ryefield
and
away
from
nicholas
saw
the
whips
their
red
caps
galloping
along
the
edge
the
ravine
even
saw
the
hounds
and
was
expecting
fox
show
itself
any
moment
the
ryefield
opposite
the
huntsman
standing
the
hollow
moved
and
loosed
his
borzois
and
nicholas
saw
queer
short
legged
red
fox
with
fine
brush
going
hard
across
the
field
the
borzois
bore
down
now
they
drew
close
the
fox
which
began
dodge
between
the
field
sharper
and
sharper
curves
trailing
its
brush
when
suddenly
strange
white
borzoi
dashed
followed
black
one
and
everything
was
confusion
the
borzois
formed
star
shaped
figure
scarcely
swaying
their
bodies
and
with
tails
turned
away
from
the
center
the
group
two
huntsmen
galloped
the
dogs
one
red

the
other
stranger
green

what
this
thought
nicholas
where
that
huntsman
from
not
uncle
man
the
huntsmen
got
the
fox
but
stayed
there
long
time
without
strapping
the
saddle
their
horses
bridled
and
with
high
saddles
stood
near
them
and
there
too
the
dogs
were
lying
the
huntsmen
waved
their
arms
and
did
something
the
fox
then
from
that
spot

with

near
the

waiting

how
the
matter
would
end
out
the
bushes
came
the
huntsman
who
had
been
fighting
and
rode
toward
his
young
master
with
the
fox
tied
his
crupper
while
still
distance
took
off
his
cap
and
tried
speak
respectfully
but
was
pale
and
breathless
and
his
face
was
angry

was
black
but
probably
was
not

the

asked
his

ilagin
lifted

that
the

and
turning
his

all

that
came
the
long
drawn
cry
one
the
borzoi
whippers
who
had
halted
stood
knoll
the
stubble
holding
his
whip
aloft
and
again
repeated
his
long
drawn

and
felt
the
agitation
the
two
elderly
men
and
her
brother
were
trying
conceal
and
was
herself
excited
the
huntsman
stood
halfway
the
knoll
holding
his
whip
and
the
gentlefolk
rode
him
footpace
the
hounds
that
were
far
off
the
horizon
turned
away
from
the
hare
and
the
whips
but
not
the
gentlefolk
also
moved
away
all
were
moving
slowly
and
sedately
how
pointing
asked
nicholas
riding
hundred
paces
toward
the
whip
who
had
sighted
the
hare
but
before
the
whip
could
reply
the
hare
scenting
the
frost
coming
next
morning
was
unable
rest
and
leaped
the
pack
leash
rushed
downhill
full
cry
after
the
hare
and
from
all
sides
the
borzois
that
were
not

darted
after
the
hounds
and
the
hare
all
the
hunt
who
had
been
moving
slowly
shouted
stop
calling
the
hounds
while
the
borzoi
whips
with
cry
galloped
across
the
field
setting
the
borzois
the
hare
the
tranquil
ilagin
nicholas
natasha
and
uncle
flew
reckless
where
and
how
they
went
seeing
only
the
borzois
and
the
hare
and
fearing
only
lose
sight
even
for
instant
the
chase
the
hare
they
had
started
was
strong
and
swift
one
when
jumped
did
not
run
once
but
pricked
his
ears
listening
the
shouting
and
trampling
that
resounded
from
all
sides
once
took
dozen
bounds
not
very
quickly
letting
the
borzois
gain
him
and
finally
having
chosen
his
direction
and
realized
his
danger
laid
back
his
ears
and
rushed
off
headlong
had
been
lying
the
stubble
but
front
him
was
the
autumn
sowing
where
the
ground
was
soft
the
two
borzois
the
huntsman
who
had
sighted
him
having
been
the
nearest
were
the
first
see
and
pursue
him
but
they
had
not
gone
far
before
ilagin
red
spotted
erza
passed
them
got
within
length
flew
the
hare
with
terrible
swiftness
aiming
his
scut
and
thinking
she
had
seized
him
rolled
over
like
ball
the
hare
arched
his
back
and
bounded
off
yet
more
swiftly
from
behind
erza
rushed
the
broad
haunched
black
spotted
milka
and
began
rapidly
gaining
the
hare
milashka
dear
rose
nicholas
triumphant
cry
looked
milka
would
immediately
pounce
the
hare
but
she
overtook
him
and
flew
past
the
hare
had
squatted
again
the
beautiful
erza
reached
him
but
when
close
the
hare
scut
paused
measuring
the
distance
not
make
mistake
this
time
but
seize
his
hind
leg
erza
darling
ilagin
wailed
voice
unlike
his
own
erza
did
not
hearken
his
appeal
the
very
moment
when
she
would
have
seized
her
prey
the
hare
moved
and
darted
along
the
balk
between
the
winter
rye
and
the
stubble
again
erza
and
milka
were
abreast
running
like
pair
carriage
horses
and
began
overtake
the
hare
but
was
easier
for
the
hare
run
the
balk
and
the
borzois
did
not
overtake
him
quickly
rugay
rugayushka
that
come
came
third
voice
just
then
and
uncle
red
borzoi
straining
and
curving
its
back
caught
with
the
two
foremost
borzois
pushed
ahead
them
regardless
the
terrible
strain
put
speed
close
the
hare
knocked
off
the
balk
onto
the
ryefield
again
put
speed
still
more
viciously
sinking
his
knees
the
muddy
field
and
all
one
could
see
was
how
muddying
his
back
rolled
over
with
the
hare
ring
borzois
surrounded
him
moment
later
everyone
had
drawn
round
the
crowd
dogs
only
the
delighted
uncle
dismounted
and
cut
off
pad
shaking
the
hare
for
the
blood
drip
off
and
anxiously
glancing
round
with
restless
eyes
while
his
arms
and
legs
twitched
spoke
without
himself
knowing
whom
what
about
that
come
that
dog
there
has
beaten
them
all
the
thousand
ruble
well
the
one
ruble
borzois
that
come
said
panting
and
looking
wrathfully
around
were
abusing
someone
they
were
all
his
enemies
and
had
insulted
him
and
only
now
had
last
succeeded
justifying
himself
there
are
your
thousand
ruble
ones
that
come
rugay
here
pad
for
you
said
throwing
down
the
hare
muddy
pad
you
deserved
that
come
she
tired
herself
out
she
run
down
three
times
herself
said
nicholas
also
not
listening
anyone
and
regardless
whether
were
heard
not
but
what
there
running
across
like
that
said
ilagin
groom
once
she
had
missed
and
turned
away
any
mongrel
could
take
ilagin
was
saying
the
same
time
breathless
from
his
gallop
and
his
excitement
the
same
moment
natasha
without
drawing
breath
screamed
joyously
ecstatically
and
piercingly
that
set
everyone
ear
tingling
that
shriek
she
expressed
what
the
others
expressed
all
talking
once
and
was
strange
that
she
must
herself
have
been
ashamed
wild
cry
and
everyone
else
would
have
been
amazed
any
other
time
uncle
himself
twisted
the
hare
threw
neatly
and
smartly
across
his
horse
back
that
gesture
meant
rebuke
everybody
and
with
air
not
wishing
speak
anyone
mounted
his
bay
and
rode
off
the
others
all
followed
dispirited
and
shamefaced
and
only
much
later
were
they
able
regain
their
former
affectation
indifference
for
long
time
they
continued
look
red
rugay
who
his
arched
back
spattered
with
mud
and
clanking
the
ring
his
leash
walked
along
just
behind
uncle
horse
with
the
serene
air
conqueror
well
like
any
other
dog
long
not
question
coursing
but
when
then
look
out
his
appearance
seemed
nicholas
saying
when
much
later
uncle
rode
nicholas
and
began
talking
him
felt
flattered
that
after
what
had
happened
uncle
deigned
speak
him

his

glowed

were
hungry
and
very
cheerful
they
looked
one

now
that
the

and
they
were

manly
superiority
over

for
after
while
uncle
came

and
small

and
natasha
felt
that
this
costume
the
very
one
she
had
regarded
with
surprise
and
amusement
otradnoe
was
just
the
right
thing
and
not

worse
than

too
was
high

and
far
from
being
offended
the
brother
and
sister

could
never
enter

that
they
might
laughing

that

and
with

fingers
taking
down
another

been

she
ridden
all
day
like

and
fresh
ever
soon
after
uncle
reappearance
the
door
was
opened
evidently
from
the
sound
barefooted
girl
and
stout
rosy
good
looking
woman
about
forty
with
double
chin
and
full
red
lips
entered
carrying
large
loaded
tray
with
hospitable
dignity
and
cordiality
her
glance
and
every
motion
she
looked
the
visitors
and
with
pleasant
smile
bowed
respectfully
spite
her
exceptional
stoutness
which
caused
her
protrude
her
chest
and
stomach
and
throw
back
her
head
this
woman
who
was
uncle
housekeeper
trod
very
lightly
she
went

down
the
tray
and
with
her
plump
white
hands
deftly
took
from
the
bottles
and
various
hors

and
dishes
and
arranged
them
the
table
when
she
had
finished
she
stepped
aside
and
stopped
the
door
with
smile
her
face
here
she
now
you
understand
uncle
her
expression
said
rostov
how
could
one
help
understanding
not
only
nicholas
but
even
natasha
understood
the
meaning
his
puckered
brow
and
the
happy
complacent
smile
that
slightly
puckered
his
lips
when
anisya

and
pleasant
smiles
take
this
little
lady
countess
she
kept
saying
she
offered

and
then
another

and
thought

anisya
fedorovna

after

over
their
cherry

rostov
and
uncle
talked
past
and
future
hunts
rugay
and
ilagin
dogs
while
natasha
sat
upright
the
sofa
and
listened
with
sparkling
eyes
she
tried
several
times
wake
petya
that
might
eat
something
but
only
muttered
incoherent
words
without
waking
natasha
felt
lighthearted
and
happy
these
novel
surroundings
that
she
only
feared
the
trap
would
come
for
her
too
soon
after
casual
pause
such
often
occurs
when
receiving
friends
for
the
first
time
one
own
house
uncle
answering
thought
that
was
his
visitors
mind
said
this
you
see
how
finishing
days
death
will
come
that
come
nothing
will
remain
then
why
harm
anyone
uncle
face
was
very
significant
and
even
handsome
said
this
involuntarily
rostov
recalled
all
the
good
had
heard
about
him
from
his
father
and
the
neighbors
throughout
the
whole
province
uncle
had
the
reputation
being
the
most
honorable
and
disinterested
cranks
they
called
him
decide
family
disputes
chose
him
executor
confided
secrets
him
elected
him
justice
and
other
posts
but
always
persistently
refused
public
appointments
passing
the
autumn
and
spring
the
fields
his
bay
gelding
sitting
home
winter
and
lying
his
overgrown
garden
summer
why
don
you
enter
the
service
uncle
did
once
but
gave
not
fit
for
that
come
can
make
head
tail
that
for
you
haven
brains
enough
now
hunting
another
matter
that
come
open
the
door
there
shouted
why
have
you
shut
the
door
the
end
the
passage
led
the
huntsmen
room
they
called
the
room
for
the
hunt
servants
there
was
rapid
patter
bare
feet
and
unseen
hand
opened
the
door
into
the
huntsmen
room
from
which
came
the
clear
sounds
balalayka
which
someone
who
was
evidently
master
the
art
was
playing
natasha
had
been
listening
those
strains
for
some
time
and
now
went
out
into
the
passage

mitka
coachman

said
uncle
was
the
custom
for
mitka
play
the
balalayka
the
huntsmen
room
when
uncle
returned
from
the
chase
uncle
was
fond
such
music
how
good
really
very
good
said
nicholas
with
some
unintentional
superciliousness
ashamed
confess
that
the
sounds
pleased
him
very
much
very
good
said
natasha
reproachfully
noticing
her
brother
tone
not
very
good
simply
delicious
just
uncle
pickled
mushrooms
honey
and
cherry
brandy
had
seemed
her
the
best
the
world
also
that
song
that
moment
seemed
her
the
acme
musical
delight
more
please
more
cried
natasha
the
door
soon
the
balalayka
ceased
mitka
tuned
afresh
and
recommenced
thrumming
the
balalayka
the
air
lady
with
trills
and
variations
uncle
sat
listening
slightly
smiling
with
his
head
one
side
the
air
was
repeated
hundred
times
the
balalayka
was
retuned
several
times
and
the
same
notes
were
thrummed
again
but
the
listeners
did
not
grow
weary
and
wished
hear
again
and
again
anisya
fedorovna
came
and
leaned
her
portly
person
against
the
doorpost
you
like
listening
she
said
natasha
with
smile
extremely
like
uncle
that
good
player
ours
she
added

said
uncle
suddenly
with
energetic
gesture
here

out

asked
natasha

did
not
answer

for
long
time
that

given
anisya
fedorovna
with
her
light
step
willingly
went
fulfill
her
errand
and
brought
back
the
guitar
without
looking
anyone
uncle
blew
the
dust
off
and
tapping
the
case
with
his
bony
fingers
tuned
the
guitar
and
settled
himself
his
armchair
took
the
guitar
little
above
the
fingerboard
arching
his
left
elbow
with
somewhat
theatrical
gesture
and
with
wink
anisya
fedorovna
struck
single
chord
pure
and
sonorous
and
then
quietly
smoothly
and
confidently
began
playing
very
slow
time
not
lady
but
the
well
known
song
came
maiden
down
the
street
the
tune
played
with
precision
and
exact
time
began
thrill
the
hearts
nicholas
and
natasha
arousing
them
the
same
kind
sober
mirth
radiated
from
anisya
fedorovna
whole
being
anisya
fedorovna
flushed
and
drawing
her
kerchief
over
her
face
went
laughing
out
the
room
uncle
continued
play
correctly
carefully
with
energetic
firmness
looking
with
changed
and
inspired
expression
the
spot
where
anisya
fedorovna
had
just
stood
something
seemed
laughing
little
one
side
his
face
under
his
gray
mustaches
especially
the
song
grew
brisker
and
the
time
quicker
and
when
here
and
there
ran
his
fingers
over
the
strings
something
seemed
snap
lovely

uncle
shouted
natasha
soon
had
finished
she
jumped
and
hugged
and
kissed
him
nicholas
nicholas
she
said
turning
her
brother
asking
him
what

too
was
greatly
pleased
uncle
playing
and
uncle
played
the
piece
over
again
anisya
fedorovna
smiling
face

the
doorway
and
behind
hers
other
faces
fetching
water
clear
and
sweet
stop
dear
maiden

played
uncle
once
more
running
his
fingers
skillfully
over
the
strings
and
then
stopped
short
and
jerked
his
shoulders
uncle
dear
natasha
wailed
imploring
tone
her
life
depended
uncle
rose
and
was
there
were
two
men
him
one
them
smiled
seriously
the
merry
fellow
while
the
merry
fellow
struck
naive
and
precise
attitude
preparatory
folk
dance
now
then
niece
exclaimed
waving
natasha
the
hand
that
had
just
struck
chord
natasha
threw
off
the
shawl
from
her
shoulders
ran
forward
face
uncle
and
setting
her
arms
akimbo
also
made
motion
with
her
shoulders
and
struck
attitude
where
how
and
when
had
this
young
countess
educated
emigree
french
governess
imbibed
from
the
russian
air
she
breathed
that
spirit
and
obtained
that
manner
which
the
pas
chale
would
one
would
have
supposed
long
ago
have
effaced
but
the
spirit
and
the
movements
were
those
inimitable
and
unteachable
russian
ones
that
uncle
had
expected
her
soon
she
had
struck
her
pose
and
smiled
triumphantly
proudly
and
with
sly
merriment
the
fear
that
had
first
seized
nicholas
and
the
others
that
she
might
not
the
right
thing
was
end
and
they
were
already
admiring
her
the
french
shawl
dance
she
did
the
right
thing
with
such
precision
such
complete
precision
that
anisya
fedorovna
who
had
once
handed
her
the
handkerchief
she
needed
for
the
dance
had
tears
her
eyes
though
she
laughed
she
watched
this
slim
graceful
countess
reared
silks
and
velvets
and
different
from
herself
who
yet
was
able
understand
all
that
was
anisya
and
anisya
father
and
mother
and
aunt
and
every
russian
man
and
woman
well
little
countess
that
come
cried
uncle
with
joyous
laugh
having
finished
the
dance
well
done
niece
now
fine
young
fellow
must
found
husband
for
you
that
come
chosen
already
said
nicholas
smiling
said
uncle
surprise
looking
inquiringly
natasha
who
nodded
her
head
with
happy
smile
and
such
one
she
said
but
soon
she
had
said
new
train
thoughts
and
feelings
arose
her
what
did
nicholas
smile
mean
when
said
chosen
already
glad
not
thought
bolkonski
would
not
approve
understand
our
gaiety
but
would
understand
all
where
now
she
thought
and
her
face
suddenly
became
serious
but
this
lasted
only
second
don
dare
think
about
she
said
herself
and
sat
down
again
smilingly
beside
uncle
begging
him
play
something
more
uncle
played
another
song
and
valse
then
after
pause
cleared
his
throat
and
sang
his
favorite
hunting
song
twas
growing
dark
last
night
fell
the
snow
soft
and
light
uncle
sang
peasants
sing
with
full
and
naive
conviction
that
the
whole
meaning
song
lies
the
words
and
that
the
tune
comes
itself
and
that
apart
from
the
words
there
tune
which
exists
only
give
measure
the
words
result
this
the
unconsidered
tune
like
the
song
bird
was
extraordinarily
good
natasha
was
ecstasies
over
uncle
singing
she
resolved
give
learning
the
harp
and
play
only
the
guitar
she
asked
uncle
for
his
guitar
and
once
found
the
chords
the
song
after
nine
clock
two
traps
and
three
mounted
men
who
had
been
sent
look
for
them
arrived
fetch
natasha
and
petya
the
count
and
countess
did
not
know
where
they
were
and
were
very
anxious
said
one
the
men
petya
was
carried
out
like
log
and
laid
the
larger
the
two
traps
natasha
and
nicholas
got
into
the
other
uncle
wrapped
natasha
warmly
and
took
leave
her
with
quite
new
tenderness
accompanied
them
foot
far
the
bridge
that
could
not
crossed
that
they
had
round
the
ford
and
sent
huntsmen
ride
front
with
lanterns
good
bye
dear
niece
his
voice
called
out
the
darkness
not
the
voice
natasha
had
known
previously
but
the
one
that
had
sung
twas
growing
dark
last
night
the
village
through
which
they
passed
there
were
red
lights
and
cheerful
smell
smoke
what
darling
uncle
said
natasha
when
they
had
come
out
onto
the
highroad
yes
returned
nicholas
you
not
cold
quite
quite
all
right
feel
comfortable
answered
natasha
almost
perplexed
her
feelings
they
remained
silent
long
while
the
night
was
dark
and
damp
they
could
not
see
the
horses
but
only
heard
them
splashing
through
the
unseen
mud
what
was
passing
that
receptive
childlike
soul
that
eagerly
caught
and
assimilated
all
the
diverse
impressions
life
how
did
they
all
find
place
her
but
she
was
very
happy
they
were
nearing
home
she
suddenly
struck
the
air
twas
growing
dark
last
night
the
tune
which
she
had
all
the
way
been
trying
get
and
had
last
caught
got
said
nicholas
what
were
you
thinking
about
just
now
nicholas
inquired
natasha
they
were
fond
asking
one
another
that
question
said
nicholas
trying
remember
well
you
see
first
thought
that
rugay
the
red
hound
was
like
uncle
and
that
were
man
would
always
keep
uncle
near
him
not
for
his
riding
then
for
his
manner
what
good
fellow
uncle
don
you
think
well
and
you
wait
bit
wait
yes
first
thought
that
are
driving
along
and
imagining
that
are
going
home
but
that
heaven
knows
where
are
really
going
the
darkness
and
that
shall
arrive
and
suddenly
find
that
are
not
otradnoe
but
fairyland
and
then
thought
nothing
else
know
expect
you
thought
him
said
nicholas
smiling
natasha
knew
the
sound
his
voice
said
natasha
though
she
had
reality
been
thinking
about
prince
andrew
the
same
time
the
rest
and
how
would
have
liked
uncle
and
then
was
saying
myself
all
the
way
how
well
anisya
carried
herself
how
well
and
nicholas
heard
her
spontaneous
happy
ringing
laughter
and
you
know
she
suddenly
said
know
that
shall
never
again
happy
and
tranquil
now
rubbish
nonsense
humbug
exclaimed
nicholas
and
thought
how
charming
this
natasha
mine
have
other
friend
like
her
and
never
shall
have
why
should
she
marry
might
always
drive
about
together
what
darling
this
nicholas
mine
thought
natasha
there
are
still
lights
the
drawing
room
she
said
pointing
the
windows
the
house
that
gleamed
invitingly
the
moist
velvety
darkness
the
night
chapter
viii
count
ilya
rostov
had
resigned
the
position
marshal
the
nobility
because
involved
him
too
much
expense
but
still
his
affairs
did
not
improve
natasha
and
nicholas
often
noticed
their
parents
conferring
together
anxiously
and
privately
and
heard
suggestions
selling
the
fine
ancestral
rostov
house
and
estate
near
moscow
was
not
necessary
entertain
freely
when
the
count
had
been
marshal
and
life
otradnoe
was
quieter
than
former
years
but
still
the
enormous
house
and
its
lodges
were
full
people
and
more
than
twenty
sat
down
table
every
day
these
were
all
their
own
people
who
had
settled
down
the
house
almost
members
the
family
persons
who
were
seemed
obliged
live
the
count
house
such
were
dimmler
the
musician
and
his
wife
vogel
the
dancing
master
and
his
family
belova
old
maiden
lady
inmate
the
house
and
many
others
such
petya
tutors
the
girls
former
governess
and
other
people
who
simply
found
preferable
and
more
advantageous
live
the
count
house
than
home
they
had
not
many
visitors
before
but
the
old
habits
life
without
which
the
count
and
countess
could
not
conceive
existence
remained
unchanged
there
was
still
the
hunting
establishment
which
nicholas
had
even
enlarged
the
same
fifty
horses
and
fifteen
grooms
the
stables
the
same
expensive
presents
and
dinner
parties
the
whole
district
name
days
there
were
still
the
count
games
whist
and
boston
which
spreading
out
his
cards
that
everybody
could
see
them
let
himself
plundered
hundreds
rubles
every
day
his
neighbors
who
looked
upon
opportunity
play
rubber
with
count
rostov
most
profitable
source
income
the
count
moved
his
affairs
huge
net
trying
not
believe
that
was
entangled
but
becoming
more
and
more
every
step
and
feeling
too
feeble
break
the
meshes
set
work
carefully
and
patiently
disentangle
them
the
countess
with
her
loving
heart
felt
that
her
children
were
being
ruined
that
was
not
the
count
fault
for
could
not
help
being
what
was
that
though
tried
hide
himself
suffered
from
the
consciousness
his
own
and
his
children
ruin
and
she
tried
find
means
remedying
the
position
from
her
feminine
point
view
she
could
see
only
one
solution
namely
for
nicholas
marry
rich
heiress
she
felt
this
their
last
hope
and
that
nicholas
refused
the
match
she
had
found
for
him
she
would
have
abandon
the
hope
ever
getting
matters
right
this
match
was
with
julie
karagina
the
daughter
excellent
and
virtuous
parents
girl
the
rostovs
had
known
from
childhood
and
who
had
now
become
wealthy
heiress
through
the
death
the
last
her
brothers
the
countess
had
written
direct
julie
mother
moscow
suggesting
marriage
between
their
children
and
had
received
favorable
answer
from
her
karagina
had
replied
that
for
her
part
she
was
agreeable
and
everything
depend
her
daughter
inclination
she
invited
nicholas
come
moscow
several
times
the
countess
with
tears
her
eyes
told
her
son
that
now
both
her
daughters
were
settled
her
only
wish
was
see
him
married
she
said
she
could
lie
down
her
grave
peacefully
that
were
accomplished
then
she
told
him
that
she
knew
splendid
girl
and
tried
discover
what
thought
about
marriage
other
times
she
praised
julie
him
and
advised
him
moscow
during
the
holidays
amuse
himself
nicholas
guessed
what
his
mother
remarks
were
leading
and
during
one
these
conversations
induced
her
speak
quite
frankly
she
told
him
that
her
only
hope
getting
their
affairs
disentangled
now
lay
his
marrying
julie
karagina
but
mamma
suppose
loved
girl
who
has
fortune
would
you
expect
sacrifice
feelings
and
honor
for
the
sake
money
asked
his
mother
not
realizing
the
cruelty
his
question
and
only
wishing
show
his
noble
mindedness
you
have
not
understood
said
his
mother
not
knowing
how
justify
herself
you
have
not
understood
nikolenka
your
happiness
wish
for
she
added
feeling
that
she
was
telling
untruth
and
was
becoming
entangled
she
began
cry
mamma
don
cry
only
tell
that
you
wish
and
you
know
will
give
life
anything
put
you
ease
said
nicholas
would
sacrifice
anything
for
you
even
feelings
but
the
countess
did
not
want
the
question
put
like
that
she
did
not
want
sacrifice
from
her
son
she
herself
wished
make
sacrifice
for
him
you
have
not
understood
don
let
talk
about
she
replied
wiping
away
her
tears
maybe
love
poor
girl
said
nicholas
himself
sacrifice
feelings
and
honor
for
money
wonder
how
mamma
could
speak
because
sonya
poor
must
not
love
her
thought
must
not
respond
her
faithful
devoted
love
yet
should
certainly
happier
with
her
than
with
some
doll
like
julie
can
always
sacrifice
feelings
for
family
welfare
said
himself
but
can
coerce
feelings
love
sonya
that
feeling
for
stronger
and
higher
than
all
else
nicholas
did
not
moscow
and
the
countess
did
not
renew
the
conversation
with
him
about
marriage
she
saw
with
sorrow
and
sometimes
with
exasperation
symptoms
growing
attachment
between
her
son
and
the
portionless
sonya
though
she
blamed
herself
for
she
could
not
refrain
from
grumbling
and
worrying
sonya
often
pulling
her
without
reason
addressing
her
stiffly
dear
and
using
the
formal
you
instead
the
intimate
thou
speaking
her
the
kindhearted
countess
was
the
more
vexed
with
sonya
because
that
poor
dark
eyed
niece
hers
was
meek
kind
devotedly
grateful
her
benefactors
and
faithfully
unchangingly
and
unselfishly
love
with
nicholas
that
there
were
grounds
for
finding
fault
with
her
nicholas
was
spending
the
last
his
leave
home
fourth

come
from

andrew
from

wrote
that

have
been

not
his
wound
unexpectedly
reopened
the
warm
climate
which
obliged
him
defer
his
return
till
the
beginning
the
new
year
natasha
was
still
much
love
with
her
betrothed
found
the
same
comfort
that
love
and
was
still
ready
throw
herself
into
all
the
pleasures
life
before
but
the
end
the
fourth
month
their
separation
she
began
have
fits
depression
which
she
could
not
master
she
felt
sorry
for
herself
sorry
that
she
was
being
wasted
all
this
time
and
use
anyone
while
she
felt
herself
capable
loving
and
being
loved

tapping
with

she
ran
quickly
upstairs

and
his
wife
who
lived
the
upper
story
two
governesses
were
sitting
with
the
vogels
table
which
were
plates
raisins
walnuts
and
almonds
the
governesses
were
discussing
whether

cheaper
live
moscow
odessa
natasha
sat
down
listened
their
talk
with
serious
and
thoughtful
air
and
then
got
again
the
island
madagascar
she
said
gas
car
she
repeated
articulating
each
syllable
distinctly
and
not
replying
madame
schoss
who
asked
her
what
she
was
saying
she
went
out
the
room
her
brother
petya

pranced
along
with
her
don
the
island
madagascar
she
said
and
jumping
off
his
back
she
went
downstairs
having
were
reviewed
her
kingdom
tested
her
power
and
made
sure
that
everyone
was
submissive
but
that
all
the
same
was
dull
natasha
betook
herself
the
ballroom
picked
her
guitar
sat
down
dark
corner
behind
bookcase
and
began
run
her
fingers
over
the
strings
the
bass
picking
out
passage
she
recalled
from
opera
she
had
heard
petersburg
with
prince
andrew
what
she
drew
from
the
guitar
would
have
had
meaning
for
other
listeners
but
her
imagination
whole
series
reminiscences
arose
from
those
sounds
she
sat
behind
the
bookcase
with
her
eyes
fixed
streak
light
escaping
from
the
pantry
door
and
listened
herself
and
pondered
she
was
mood
for
brooding
the
past
sonya
passed
the
pantry
with
glass
her
hand
natasha
glanced
her
and
the
crack
the
pantry
door
and
seemed
her
that
she
remembered
the
light
falling
through
that
crack
once
before
and
sonya
passing
with
glass
her
hand
yes
was
exactly
the
same
thought
natasha
sonya
what
this
she
cried
twanging
thick
string
you
are
there
said
sonya
with
start
and
came
near
and
listened
don
know
storm
she
ventured
timidly
afraid
being
wrong
there
that
just
how
she
started
and
just
how
she
came
smiling
timidly
when
all
this
happened
before
thought
natasha
and
just
the
same
way
thought
there
was
something
lacking
her
the
chorus
from
the
water
carrier
listen
and
natasha
sang
the
air
the
chorus
that
sonya
should
catch
where
were
you
going
she
asked
change
the
water
this
glass
just
finishing
the
design
you
always
find
something
but
can
said
natasha
and
where
nicholas
asleep
think
sonya
and
wake
him
said
natasha
tell
him
want
him
come
and
sing
she
sat
awhile
wondering
what
the
meaning
all
having
happened
before
could
and
without
solving
this
problem
all
regretting
not
having
done
she
again
passed
fancy
the
time
when
she
was
with
him
and
was
looking
her
with
lover
eyes
only
would
come
quicker
afraid
will
never
and
worst
all
growing
old
that
the
thing
there
won
then
what
there
now
but
perhaps
come
today
will
come
immediately
perhaps
has
come
and
sitting
the
drawing
room
perhaps
came
yesterday
and
have
forgotten
she
rose
put
down
the
guitar
and
went
the
drawing
room
all
the
domestic
circle
tutors
governesses
and
guests
were
already
the
tea
table
the
servants
stood
round
the
table
but
prince
andrew
was
not
there
and
life
was
going
before
here
she
said
the
old
count
when
saw
natasha
enter
well
sit
down
but
natasha
stayed
her
mother
and
glanced
round
looking
for
something
mamma
she
muttered
give
him
give
him
mamma
quickly
quickly
and
she
again
had
difficulty
repressing
her
sobs
she
sat
down
the
table
and
listened
the
conversation
between
the
elders
and
nicholas
who
had
also
come
the
table
god
god
the
same
faces
the
same
talk
papa
holding
his
cup
and
blowing
the
same
way
thought
natasha
feeling
with
horror
sense
repulsion
rising
her
for
the
whole
household
because
they
were
always
the
same
after
tea
nicholas
sonya
and
natasha
went
the
sitting
room
their
favorite
corner
where
their
most
intimate
talks
always
began
chapter
does
ever
happen
you
said
natasha
her
brother
when
they
settled
down
the
sitting
room
does
ever
happen
you
feel
there
were
nothing
more
come
nothing
that
everything
good
past
and
feel
not
exactly
dull
but
sad
should
think
replied
have
felt
like
that
when
everything
was
all
right
and
everyone
was
cheerful
the
thought
has
come
into
mind
that
was
already
tired
all
and
that
must
all
die
once
the
regiment
had
not
gone
some
merrymaking
where
there
was
music
and
suddenly
felt
depressed
yes
know
know
know
natasha
interrupted
him
when
was
quite
little
that
used
with
you
remember
when
was
punished
once
about
some
plums
you
were
all
dancing
and
sat
sobbing
the
schoolroom
shall
never
forget
felt
sad
and
sorry
for
everyone
for
myself
and
for
everyone
and
was
innocent
that
was
the
chief
thing
said
natasha
you
remember
remember
answered
nicholas
remember
that
came
you
afterwards
and
wanted
comfort
you
but
you
know
felt
ashamed
were
terribly
absurd
had
funny
doll
then
and
wanted
give
you
you
remember
and
you
remember
natasha
asked
with
pensive
smile
how
once
long
long
ago
when
were
quite
little
uncle
called
into
the
study
that
was
the
old
house
and
was
dark
went
and
suddenly
there
stood
negro
chimed
nicholas
with
smile
delight
course
remember
even
now
don
know
whether
there
really
was
negro
only
dreamed
were
told
about
him
was
gray
you
remember
and
had
white
teeth
and
stood
and
looked
sonya
you
remember
asked
nicholas
yes
yes
remember
something
too
sonya
answered
timidly
you
know
have
asked
papa
and
mamma
about
that
negro
said
natasha
and
they
say
there
was
negro
all
but
you
see
you
remember
course
remember
his
teeth
had
just
seen
them
how
strange
were
dream
like
that
and
you
remember
how
rolled
hard
boiled
eggs
the
ballroom
and
suddenly
two
old
women
began
spinning
round
the
carpet
was
that
real
not
you
remember
what
fun
was
yes
and
you
remember
how
papa
his
blue
overcoat
fired
gun
the
porch
they
went
through
their
memories
smiling
with
pleasure
not
the
sad
memories
old
age
but
poetic
youthful
ones
those
impressions
one
most
distant
past
which
dreams
and
realities
blend
and
they
laughed
with
quiet
enjoyment
sonya
always
did
not
quite
keep
pace
with
them
though
they
shared
the
same
reminiscences
much
that
they
remembered
had
slipped
from
her
mind
and
what
she
recalled
did
not
arouse
the
same
poetic
feeling
they
experienced
she
simply
enjoyed
their
pleasure
and
tried
fit
with
she
only
really
took
part
when
they
recalled
sonya
first
arrival
she
told
them
how
afraid
she
had
been
nicholas
because
had
corded
jacket
and
her
nurse
had
told
her
that
she
too
would
sewn
with
cords
and
remember
their
telling
that
you
had
been
born
under
cabbage
said
natasha
and
remember
that
dared
not
disbelieve
then
but
knew
that
was
not
true
and
felt
uncomfortable
while
they
were
talking
maid
thrust
her
head
the
other
door
the
sitting
room
they
have
brought
the
cock
miss
she
said
whisper

replied
natasha
the
middle
their
talk
the
sitting
room
dimmler
came
and
went
the
harp
that
stood
there
corner
took
off
its
cloth
covering
and
the
harp
gave
out
jarring
sound
dimmler
please
play
favorite
nocturne
field
came
the
old
countess
voice
from
the
drawing
room
dimmler
struck
chord
and
turning
natasha
nicholas
and
sonya
remarked
how
quiet
you
young
people
are
yes
philosophizing
said
natasha
glancing
round
for
moment
and
then
continuing
the
conversation
they
were
now
discussing
dreams
dimmler
began
play
natasha
went
tiptoe
noiselessly
the
table
took
candle
carried
out
and
returned
seating
herself
quietly
her
former
place
was
dark
the
room
especially
where
they
were
sitting
the
sofa
but
through
the
big
windows
the
silvery
light
the
full
moon
fell
the
floor
dimmler
had
finished
the
piece
but
still
sat
softly
running
his
fingers
over
the
strings
evidently
uncertain
whether
stop
play
something
else
you
know
said
natasha
whisper
moving
closer
nicholas
and
sonya
that
when
one
goes
and
recalling
memories
one
last
begins
remember
what
happened
before
one
was
the
world
that
metempsychosis
said
sonya
who
had
always
learned
well
and
remembered
everything
the
egyptians
believed
that
our
souls
have
lived
animals
and
will
back
into
animals
again
don
believe
ever
were
animals
said
natasha
still
whisper
though
the
music
had
ceased
but
certain
that
were
angels
somewhere
there
and
have
been
here
and
that
why
remember
may
join
you
said
dimmler
who
had
come
quietly
and
sat
down
them
have
been
angels
why
have
fallen
lower
said
nicholas
that
can
not
lower
who
said
were
lower
how
know
what
was
before
natasha
rejoined
with
conviction
the
soul
immortal
well
then
shall
always
live
must
have
lived
before
lived
for
whole
eternity
yes
but
hard
for
imagine
eternity
remarked
dimmler
who
had
joined
the
young
folk
with
mildly
condescending
smile
but
now
spoke
quietly
and
seriously
they
why
hard
imagine
eternity
said
natasha
now
today
and
will
tomorrow
and
always
and
there
was
yesterday
and
the
day
before
natasha
now
your
turn
sing
something
they
heard
the
countess
say
why
are
you
sitting
there
like
conspirators
mamma
don
all
want
replied
natasha
but
all
the
same
she
rose
none
them
not
even
the
middle
aged
dimmler
wanted
break
off
their
conversation
and
quit
that
corner
the
sitting
room
but
natasha
got
and
nicholas
sat
down
the
clavichord
standing
usual
the
middle
the
hall
and
choosing
the
place
where
the
resonance
was
best
natasha
began
sing
her
mother
favorite
song
she
had
said
she
did
not
want
sing
but
was
long
since
she
had
sung
and
long
before
she
again
sang
she
did
that
evening
the
count
from
his
study
where
was
talking
mitenka
heard
her
and
like
schoolboy
hurry
run
out
play
blundered
his
talk
while
giving
orders
the
steward
and
last
stopped
while
mitenka
stood
front
him
also
listening
and
smiling
nicholas
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
his
sister
and
drew
breath
time
with
her
sonya
she
listened
thought
the
immense
difference
there
was
between
herself
and
her
friend
and
how
impossible
was
for
her
anything
like
bewitching
her
cousin
the
old
countess
sat
with
blissful
yet
sad
smile
and
with
tears
her
eyes
occasionally
shaking
her
head
she
thought
natasha
and
her
own
youth
and
how
there
was
something
unnatural
and
dreadful
this
impending
marriage
natasha
and
prince
andrew
dimmler
who
had
seated
himself
beside
the
countess
listened
with
closed
eyes
countess
said
last
that
european
talent
she
has
nothing
learn
what
softness
tenderness
and
strength
how
afraid
for
her
how
afraid
said
the
countess
not
realizing
whom
she
was
speaking
her
maternal
instinct
told
her
that
natasha
had
too
much
something
and
that
because
this
she
would
not
happy
before
natasha
had
finished
singing
fourteen
year
old
petya
rushed
delightedly
say
that
some
mummers
had
arrived
natasha
stopped
abruptly
idiot
she
screamed
her
brother
and
running
chair
threw
herself
sobbing
violently
that
she
could
not
stop
for
long
time
nothing
mamma
really
nothing
only
petya
startled
she
said
trying
smile
but
her
tears
still
flowed
and
sobs
still
choked
her
the
mummers
some
the
house
serfs
dressed
bears
turks
innkeepers
and
ladies
frightening
and
funny
bringing
with
them
the
cold
from
outside
and
feeling
gaiety
crowded
first
timidly
into
the
anteroom
then
hiding
behind
one
another
they
pushed
into
the
ballroom
where
shyly
first
and
then
more
and
more
merrily
and
heartily
they
started
singing
dancing
and
playing
christmas
games
the
countess
when
she
had
identified
them
and
laughed
their
costumes
went
into
the
drawing
room
the
count
sat
the
ballroom
smiling
radiantly
and
applauding
the
players
the
young
people
had
disappeared
half
hour
later
there
appeared
among
the
other
mummers
the
ballroom
old

hooped

this
was
nicholas
turkish

was
petya
clown
was
dimmler
hussar
was
natasha
and
circassian
was
sonya
with
burnt
cork
mustache
and
eyebrows
after
the
condescending
surprise
nonrecognition
and
praise
from
those
who
were
not
themselves
dressed
the
young
people
decided
that
their
costumes
were
good
that
they
ought
shown
elsewhere
nicholas
who
the
roads
were
splendid
condition
wanted
take
them
all

proposed

mummers
and

said
the

thoroughly
aroused
dress

and
with
them
make
pashette
open
her
eyes
but
the
countess
would
not
agree
his
going
had
had
bad
leg
all
these
last
days
was
decided
that
the
count
must
not
but
that
louisa
ivanovna
madame
schoss
would
with
them
the
young
ladies
might
the
melyukovs

urgently

anyone
begging

ivanovna
not
refuse
sonya

the
best
all
her
mustache
and
eyebrows
were
extraordinarily
becoming
everyone
told
her
she
looked
very
handsome
and
she
was
spirited
and
energetic
mood
unusual
with
her
some
inner
voice
told
her
that
now
never
her
fate
would
decided
and
her
male
attire
she
seemed
quite
different
person
louisa
ivanovna
consented
and
half
hour
four
troyka

large

squeaking
and
whistling
over
the

passing

moved
noisily
their
runners
squeaking
first
they
drove
steady
trot
along
the
narrow
road
while
they
drove
past
the
garden
the
shadows
the
bare
trees
often
fell
across
the
road
and
hid
the
brilliant
moonlight
but
soon
they
were
past
the
fence
the
snowy
plain
bathed
moonlight
and
motionless
spread
out
before
them
glittering
like
diamonds
and
dappled
with
bluish
shadows
bang

went
the
first
sleigh
over
cradle
hole
the
snow
the
road
and
each
the
other
sleighs
jolted
the

way
and
rudely
breaking
the

the

began
speed
along

nicholas
glanced
round
sonya
and
bent
down
see
her
face
closer
quite
new
sweet
face
with
black
eyebrows
and
mustaches
peeped
him
from
her
sable
furs
close
and
yet
distant
the
moonlight
that
used
sonya
thought
and
looked
her
closer
and
smiled
what
nicholas
nothing
said
and
turned
again
the
horses
when
they
came
out
onto
the
beaten
highroad
polished
sleigh
runners
and
cut
rough
shod
hoofs
the
marks
which
were
visible
the
moonlight
the
horses
began
tug
the
reins
their
own
accord
and
increased
their
pace
the
near
side
horse
arching
his
head
and
breaking
into
short
canter
tugged
his
traces
the

swayed
from

his

ringing
farther
and
farther
off
the

could
clearly
seen
against
the
white
snow
from
that
sleigh
one
could
hear
the
shouts
laughter
and
voices
the
mummers
gee
darlings
shouted
nicholas
pulling
the
reins
one
side
and
flourishing
the
whip
was
only
the
keener
wind
that
met
them
and
the
jerks
given
the
side
horses
who
pulled
harder
ever
increasing
their
gallop
that
one
noticed
how
fast
the
troyka
was
flying
nicholas
looked
back
with
screams
squeals
and
waving
whips
that
caused
even
the
shaft
horses
gallop
the
other
sleighs
followed
the
shaft
horse
swung
steadily
beneath
the
bow
over
its
head
with
thought
slackening
pace
and
ready
put
speed
when
required
nicholas
overtook
the
first
sleigh
they
were
driving
downhill
and
coming
out
upon
broad
trodden
track
across
meadow
near

where
are
thought
the

suppose
but
this
something
new
never
seen
before
this
isn
the

meadow
nor
the

hill
and
heaven
only
knows
what
something
new
and
enchanted
well
whatever
may
and
shouting
his
horses
began
pass
the
first
sleigh
zakhar
held
back
his
horses
and
turned
his
face
which
was
already
covered
with
hoarfrost
his
eyebrows
nicholas
gave
the
horses
the
rein
and
zakhar
stretching
out
his
arms
clucked
his
tongue
and
let
his
horses
now
look
out

cried
faster
still
the
two
troykas
flew
side
side
and
faster
moved
the
feet
the
galloping

nicholas
began
draw
ahead

keeping
his

extended
raised
one
hand
with

shouted
nicholas
put
all
his
horses
gallop
and
passed
zakhar
the
horses
showered
the
fine
dry
snow
the
faces
those
the
sleigh
beside
them
sounded
quick
ringing
bells
and
they
caught
confused
glimpses
swiftly
moving
legs
and
the
shadows
the
troyka
they
were
passing
the
whistling
sound
the
runners
the
snow
and
the
voices
girls
shrieking
were
heard
from
different
sides
again
checking
his
horses
nicholas
looked
around
him
they
were
still
surrounded
the
magic
plain
bathed
moonlight
and
spangled
with
stars
zakhar
shouting
that
should
turn
the
left
but
why
the
left
thought
nicholas
are
getting
the
melyukovs
this
melyukovka
heaven
only
knows
where

going
and
heaven
knows
what

very
strange
and

the
strange
pretty
unfamiliar

asked
they
did
not
answer
but
began
laugh
dimmler
from
the
sleigh
behind
shouted
something
probably
something
funny
but
they
could
not
make
out
what
said
yes
yes
some
voices
answered
laughing
but
here
was
fairy

with
black
moving

and
glitter
diamonds
and
flight
marble
steps
and
the
silver

was
and
how
she
should
stand
and
listen
and
they
handed
her
fur
cloak
she
threw
this
over
her
head
and
shoulders
and
glanced
nicholas
what
darling
that
girl
thought
and
what
have
been
thinking
till
now
sonya
went
out
into
the
passage
the
barn
nicholas
went
hastily
the
front
porch
saying
felt
too
hot
the
crowd
people
really
had
made
the
house
stuffy
outside
there
was
the
same
cold
stillness
and
the
same
moon
but
even
brighter
than
before
the
light
was
strong
and
the
snow
sparkled
with
many
stars
that
one
did
not
wish
look
the
sky
and
the
real
stars
were
unnoticed
the
sky
was
black
and
dreary
while
the
earth
was
gay
fool
fool
what
have
been
waiting
for
thought
nicholas
and
running
out
from
the
porch
went
round
the
corner
the
house
and
along
the
path
that
led
the
back
porch
knew
sonya
would
pass
that
way
halfway
lay
some
snow
covered
piles
firewood
and
across
and
along
them
network
shadows
from
the
bare
old
lime
trees
fell
the
snow
and
the
path
this
path
led
the
barn
the
log
walls
the
barn
and
its
snow
covered
roof
that
looked
hewn
out
some
precious
stone
sparkled
the
moonlight
tree
the
garden
snapped
with
the
frost
and
then
all
was
again
perfectly
silent
his
bosom
seemed
inhale
not
air
but
the
strength
eternal
youth
and
gladness
from
the
back
porch
came
the
sound
feet
descending
the
steps
the
bottom
step
upon
which
snow
had
fallen
gave
ringing
creak
and
heard
the
voice
old
maidservant
saying
straight
straight
along
the
path
miss
only
don
look
back
not
afraid
answered
sonya
voice
and
along
the
path
toward
nicholas
came
the
crunching
whistling
sound
sonya
feet
her
thin
shoes
sonya
came
along
wrapped
her
cloak
she
was
only
couple
paces
away
when
she
saw
him
and
her
too
was
not
the
nicholas
she
had
known
and
always
slightly
feared
was

with
tousled
hair
and
happy
smile
new
sonya
she
ran
rapidly
toward
him
quite
different
and
yet
the
same
thought
nicholas
looking
her
face
all
lit
the
moonlight
slipped
his
arms
under
the
cloak
that
covered
her
head
embraced
her
pressed
her
him
and
kissed
her
the
lips
that
wore
mustache
and
had
smell
burnt
cork
sonya
kissed
him
full
the
lips
and
disengaging
her
little
hands
pressed
them
his
cheeks
sonya
nicholas
was
all
they
said
they
ran
the
barn
and
then
back
again
entering
the

the

chapter

when
they
all
drove

danilovna
natasha
who
always
saw
and
noticed
everything
arranged
that

and
madame

and
sonya
with
nicholas
and
the
maids
the
way
back
nicholas
drove
steady
pace
instead
racing
and
kept
peering
that
fantastic
all
transforming
light
into
sonya
face
and
searching
beneath
the
eyebrows
and
mustache
for
his
former
and
his
present
sonya
from
whom
had
resolved
never
parted
again
looked
and
recognizing
her
both
the
old
and
the
new
sonya
and
being
reminded
the
smell
burnt
cork
the
sensation
her
kiss
inhaled
the
frosty
air
with
full
breast
and
looking
the
ground
flying
beneath
him
and
the
sparkling
sky
felt
himself
again
fairyland
sonya
well
with
thee
asked
from
time
time
yes
she
replied
and
with
thee
when
halfway
home
nicholas
handed
the
reins
the
coachman
and
ran
for
moment
natasha
sleigh
and
stood
its
wing
natasha
whispered
french

made

about
sonya

asked
natasha
suddenly
beaming
all
over
with
joy

that
mustache
and
those
eyebrows
natasha
are
you
glad

natasha
now
glad

back

wait
bit
how
funny

cried
nicholas
peering
into
her
face
and
finding
his
sister
too
something
new
unusual
and
bewitchingly
tender
that
had
not
seen
her
before
natasha
magical
isn
yes
she
replied
you
have
done
splendidly
had
seen
her
before

now
thought
nicholas
should
long
ago
have
asked
her
what

have
done
whatever
she
told
and
all
would
have
been
well
you

nearly
stormed
mamma
will
never
let
anyone
say

her
then
all
right
said
nicholas
again
scrutinizing
the
expression
his
sister
face
see
she
was
earnest
then
jumped
down
and
his
boots
scrunching
the
snow
ran
back
his
sleigh
the
same
happy
smiling
circassian
with
mustache
and
beaming
eyes
looking
from
under
sable
hood
was
still
sitting
there
and
that
circassian
was
sonya
and
that
sonya
was
certainly
his
future
happy
and
loving
wife
when
they
reached
home
and
had
told
their
mother
how
they
had
spent
the
evening

melyukovs
the
girls
went

bedroom
when
they
had
undressed

without
washing
off

sat
long
time
talking
their

talked
how
they
would

held
into
the
right
position
opposite
the
other
her
face
assumed
serious
expression
and
she
sat
silent
she
sat

time
looking

expecting

suddenly
sonya
pushed
away

and
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hand
natasha
she
cried

natasha

natasha
seizing

sonya
could

but
why

something
others

besides
who

tell
whether

through

mind
yes

she
said
how
standing
lying

first
there

nothing
then
saw
him
lying
down

natasha
her
frightened
eyes
fixed
her
friend
the
contrary
the
contrary
his
face
was
cheerful
and
turned
and
when
saying
this
she
herself
fancied
she
had
really
seen
what
she
described
well
and
then
sonya
after
that
could
not
make
out
what
there
was
something
blue
and
red
sonya
when
will
come
back
when

him
god
how
afraid
for

and
for

and
about

natasha
began
and
without
replying
sonya
words
comfort
she
got
into
bed
and
long
after

motionless
gazing

frosty
windowpanes
chapter
xiii
soon
after
the
christmas
holidays
nicholas
told
his
mother
his
love
for
sonya
and
his
firm
resolve
marry
her
the
countess
who
had
long
noticed
what
was
going
between
them
and
was
expecting
this
declaration
listened
him
silence
and
then
told
her
son
that
might
marry
whom
pleased
but
that
neither
she
nor
his
father
would
give
their
blessing
such
marriage
nicholas
for
the
first
time
felt
that
his
mother
was
displeased
with
him
and
that
despite
her
love
for
him
she
would
not
give
way
coldly
without
looking
her
son
she
sent
for
her
husband
and
when
came
tried
briefly
and
coldly
inform
him
the
facts
her
son
presence
but
unable
restrain
herself
she
burst
into
tears
vexation
and
left
the
room
the
old
count
began
irresolutely
admonish
nicholas
and
beg
him
abandon
his
purpose
nicholas
replied
that
could
not
back
his
word
and
his
father
sighing
and
evidently
disconcerted
very
soon
became
silent
and
went
the
countess
all
his
encounters
with
his
son
the
count
was
always
conscious
his
own
guilt
toward
him
for
having
wasted
the
family
fortune
and
could
not
angry
with
him
for
refusing
marry
heiress
and
choosing
the
dowerless
sonya
this
occasion
was
only
more
vividly
conscious
the
fact
that
his
affairs
had
not
been
disorder
better
wife
for
nicholas
than
sonya
could
have
been
wished
for
and
that
one
but
himself
with
his
mitenka
and
his
uncomfortable
habits
was
blame
for
the
condition
the
family
finances
the
father
and
mother
did
not
speak
the
matter
their
son
again
but
few
days
later
the
countess
sent
for
sonya
and
with
cruelty
neither
them
expected
reproached
her
niece
for
trying
catch
nicholas
and
for
ingratitude
sonya
listened
silently
with
downcast
eyes
the
countess
cruel
words
without
understanding
what
was
required
her
she
was
ready
sacrifice
everything
for
her
benefactors
self
sacrifice
was
her
most
cherished
idea
but
this
case
she
could
not
see
what
she
ought
sacrifice
for
whom
she
could
not
help
loving
the
countess
and
the
whole
rostov
family
but
neither
could
she
help
loving
nicholas
and
knowing
that
his
happiness
depended
that
love
she
was
silent
and
sad
and
did
not
reply
nicholas
felt
the
situation
intolerable
and
went
have
explanation
with
his
mother
first
implored
her
forgive
him
and
sonya
and
consent
their
marriage
then
threatened
that
she
molested
sonya
would
once
marry
her
secretly
the
countess
with
coldness
her
son
had
never
seen
her
before
replied
that
was
age
that
prince
andrew
was
marrying
without
his
father
consent
and
could
the
same
but
that
she
would
never
receive
that
intriguer
her
daughter
exploding
the
word
intriguer
nicholas
raising
his
voice
told
his
mother
had
never
expected
her
try
force
him
sell
his
feelings
but
that
were
would
say
for
the
last
time
but
had
time
utter
the
decisive
word
which
the
expression
his
face
caused
his
mother
await
with
terror
and
which
would
perhaps
have
forever
remained
cruel
memory
them
both
had
not
time
say
for
natasha
with
pale
and
set
face
entered
the
room
from
the
door
which
she
had
been
listening
nicholas
you
are
talking
nonsense
quiet
quiet
quiet
tell
you
she
almost
screamed
drown
his
voice
mamma
darling
not
all
poor
sweet
darling
she
said
her
mother
who
conscious
that
they
had
been
the
brink
rupture
gazed
her
son
with
terror
but
the
obstinacy
and
excitement
the
conflict
could
not
and
would
not
give
way
nicholas
explain
you
away
listen
mamma
darling
said
natasha
her
words
were
incoherent
but
they
attained
the
purpose
which
she
was
aiming
the
countess
sobbing
heavily
hid
her
face
her
daughter
breast
while
nicholas
rose
clutching
his
head
and
left
the
room
natasha
set
work
effect
reconciliation
and
far
succeeded
that
nicholas
received
promise
from
his
mother
that
sonya
should
not
troubled
while
his
side
promised
not
undertake
anything
without
his
parents
knowledge
firmly
resolved
after
putting
his
affairs

from

his

after
nicholas
had
gone
things
the
rostov
household
were
more
depressing
than
ever
and
the
countess
fell
ill
from
mental
agitation
sonya
was
unhappy
the
separation
from
nicholas
and
still
more
account
the
hostile
tone
the
countess
could
not
help
adopting
toward
her
the
count
was
more
perturbed
than
ever
the
condition
his
affairs
which
called
for
some
decisive
action
their
town
house
and
estate
near
moscow
had
inevitably
sold
and
for
this
they
had
moscow
but
the

health
obliged
them
delay
their
departure
from

day
natasha
who
had
borne
the
first
period
separation
from
her
betrothed
lightly
and
even
cheerfully
now
grew
more
agitated
and
impatient
every
day
the
thought
that
her
best
days
which
she
would
have
employed
loving
him
were
being
vainly
wasted
with
advantage
anyone
tormented
her
incessantly
his
letters
for
the
most
part
irritated
her
hurt
her
think
that
while
she
lived
only
the
thought
him
was
living
real
life
seeing
new
places
and
new
people
that
interested
him
the
more
interesting
his
letters
were
the
more
vexed
she
felt
her
letters
him
far
from
giving
her
any
comfort
seemed
her
wearisome
and
artificial
obligation
she
could
not
write
because
she
could
not
conceive
the
possibility
expressing
sincerely
letter
even
thousandth
part
what
she
expressed
voice
smile
and
glance
she
wrote
him
formal
monotonous
and
dry
letters
which
she
attached
importance
herself
and
the
rough
copies

the

corrected

pierre
was
one
those
retired
gentlemen
waiting
whom
there
were
hundreds
good
humoredly
ending
their
days
moscow
how
horrified
would
have
been
seven
years
before
when
first
arrived
from
abroad
had
been
told
that
there
was
need
for
him
seek
plan
anything
that
his
rut
had
long
been
shaped
eternally
predetermined
and
that
wriggle
might
would
what
all
his

were
could
not
have

had
not

longed
with
all
his

establish
republic
russia
then
himself
napoleon
then
philosopher
and
then
strategist
and
the
conqueror
napoleon
had
not
seen
the

and
passionately
desired
the
regeneration

sinful
human
race
and
his
own
progress
the
highest
degree

not
established

liberated
his

instead
all
that
here
was
the

unfaithful

retired
gentleman

fond
eating

unbuttoned
his

abusing
the
government
bit
member
the
moscow
english
club
and
universal
favorite
moscow
society
for
long
time
could
not
reconcile
himself
the
idea
that
was
one
those
same
retired
moscow
gentlemen
waiting
had
despised
seven
years
before
sometimes
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
was
only
living
this
life
temporarily
but
then
was
shocked
the
thought
how
many
like
himself
had
entered
that
life
and
that
club
temporarily
with
all
their
teeth
and
hair
and
had
only
left
when
not
single
tooth
hair
remained
moments
pride
when
thought
his
position
seemed
him
that
was
quite
different
and
distinct
from
those
other
retired
gentlemen
waiting
had
formerly
despised
they
were
empty
stupid
contented
fellows
satisfied
with
their
position
while
still
discontented
and
want
something
for
mankind
but
perhaps
all
these
comrades
mine
struggled
just
like
and
sought
something
new
path
life
their
own
and
like
were
brought
force
circumstances
society
and
race
that
elemental
force
against
which
man
powerless
the
condition
said
himself
moments
humility
and
after
living
some
time
moscow
longer
despised
but
began
grow
fond
respect
and
pity
his
comrades
destiny
pitied
himself
pierre
longer
suffered
moments
despair
hypochondria
and
disgust
with
life
but
the
malady
that
had
formerly
found
expression
such
acute
attacks
was
driven
inwards
and
never
left
him
for
moment
what
for
why
what
going
the
world
would
ask
himself
perplexity
several
times
day
involuntarily
beginning
reflect
anew
the
meaning
the
phenomena
life
but
knowing
experience
that
there
were
answers
these
questions
made
haste
turn
away
from
them
and
took

hurried
off

how

tried
and
have
always
found
that
they
too
the
depths
their
souls
understand
and
only
try
not

appears
that
must
but
what
become
thought
had
the
unfortunate
capacity
many
men
especially
russians
have
seeing
and
believing
the
possibility
goodness
and
truth
but
seeing
the
evil
and
falsehood
life
too
clearly
able
take
serious

was
connected
his

with

whatever
tried
whatever
engaged
the

and

repulsed
him
and
blocked
every
path
activity
yet
had
live
and
find
occupation
was
too
dreadful
under
the
burden
these
insoluble
problems
abandoned
himself
any
distraction
order
forget
them
frequented
every
kind
society
drank
much
bought
pictures
engaged
building
and
above
all
read
read
and
read
everything
that
came
hand
coming
home
while
his
valets
were
still
taking
off
his
things
picked

and
began

gossip
drawing
rooms
the

from

carousals
and
women
from

back
gossip
reading
and
wine
drinking
became
more
and
more
physical
and
also
moral
necessity
though
the
doctors
warned
him
that
with
his
corpulence
wine
was
dangerous
for
him
drank
great
deal
was
only
quite
ease
when
having
poured
several
glasses
wine
mechanically
into
his
large
mouth
felt
pleasant
warmth
his
body
amiability
toward
all
his
fellows
and
readiness
respond
superficially
every
idea
without
probing
deeply
only
after
emptying
bottle
two
did
feel
dimly
that
the
terribly
tangled
skein
life
which
previously
had
terrified
him
was
not
dreadful
had
thought
was
always
conscious
some
aspect
that
skein
with
buzzing
his
head
after
dinner
supper
chatted
listened
conversation
read
but
under
the
influence
wine
said
himself
doesn
matter
get
unraveled
have
solution
ready
but
have
time
now
think
all
out
later
but
the
later
never
came
the
morning
empty
stomach
all
the
old
questions
appeared
insoluble
and
terrible
ever
and
pierre
hastily
picked
book
and
anyone
came
see
him
was
glad
sometimes
remembered
how
had
heard
that
soldiers
war
when
entrenched
under
the
enemy
fire
they
have
nothing
try
hard
find
some
occupation
the
more
easily
bear
the
danger
pierre
all
men
seemed
like
those
soldiers
seeking
refuge
from
life
some
ambition
some
cards
some
framing
laws
some
women
some
toys
some
horses
some
politics
some
sport
some
wine
and
some
governmental
affairs
nothing
trivial
and
nothing
important
all
the
same
only
save
oneself
from
best
one
can
thought
pierre
only
not
see
that
dreadful
chapter
the
beginning
winter
prince
nicholas
bolkonski
and
his
daughter
moved
moscow
that
time
enthusiasm
for
the
emperor
alexander
regime
had
weakened
and
patriotic
and
anti
french
tendency
prevailed
there
and
this
together
with
his
past
and
his
intellect
and
his
originality
once
made
prince
nicholas
bolkonski
object
particular
respect
the
moscovites
and
the
center
the
moscow
opposition
the
government
the
prince
had
aged
very
much
that
year
showed
marked
signs
senility
tendency
fall
asleep
forgetfulness
quite
recent
events
remembrance
remote
ones
and
the
childish
vanity
with
which
accepted
the
role
head
the
moscow
opposition
spite
this
the
old
man
inspired
all
his
visitors
alike
feeling
respectful
veneration
especially
evening
when
came
tea
his
old
fashioned
coat
and
powdered
wig
and
aroused
anyone
told
his
abrupt
stories
the
past
uttered
yet
more
abrupt
and
scathing
criticisms
the
present
for
them
all
that
old
fashioned
house
with
its
gigantic
mirrors
pre
revolution
furniture
powdered
footmen
and
the
stern
shrewd
old
man
himself
relic
the
past
century
with
his
gentle
daughter
and
the
pretty
frenchwoman
who
were
reverently
devoted
him
presented
majestic
and
agreeable
spectacle
but
the
visitors
did
not
reflect
that
besides
the
couple
hours
during
which
they
saw
their
host
there
were
also
twenty
two
hours
the
day
during
which
the
private
and
intimate
life
the
house
continued
latterly
that
private
life
had
become
very
trying
for
princess
mary
there
moscow
she
was
deprived
her
greatest
pleasures
talks
with
the
pilgrims
and
the
solitude
which
refreshed
her
bald
hills
and
she
had
none
the
advantages
and
pleasures
city
life
she
did
not
out
into
society
everyone
knew
that
her
father
would
not
let
her
anywhere
without
him
and
his
failing
health
prevented
his
going
out
himself
that
she
was
not
invited
dinners
and
evening
parties
she
had
quite
abandoned
the
hope
getting
married
she
saw
the
coldness
and
malevolence
with
which
the
old
prince
received
and
dismissed
the
young
men
possible
suitors
who
sometimes
appeared
their
house
she
had
friends
during
this
visit
moscow
she
had
been
disappointed
the
two
who
had
been
nearest
her
mademoiselle
bourienne
with
whom
she
had
never
been
able
quite
frank
had
now
become
unpleasant
her
and
for
various
reasons
princess
mary
avoided
her
julie
with
whom
she
had
corresponded
for
the
last
five
years
was
moscow
but
proved
quite
alien
her
when
they
met
just
then
julie
who
the
death
her
brothers
had
become
one
the
richest
heiresses
moscow
was
the
full
whirl
society
pleasures
she
was
surrounded
young
men
who
she
fancied
had
suddenly
learned
appreciate
her
worth
julie
was
that
stage
the
life
society
woman
when
she
feels
that
her
last
chance
marrying
has
come
and
that
her
fate
must
decided
now
never
thursdays
princess
mary
remembered
with
mournful
smile
that
she
now
had
one
write
since
julie
whose
presence
gave
her
pleasure
was
here
and
they
met
every
week
like
the
old
emigre
who
declined
marry
the
lady
with
whom
had
spent
his
evenings
for
years
she
regretted
julie
presence
and
having
one
write
moscow
princess
mary
had
one
talk
one
whom
confide
her
sorrow
and
much
sorrow
fell
her
lot
just
then
the
time
for
prince
andrew
return
and
marriage
was
approaching
but
his
request
her
prepare
his
father
for
had
not
been
carried
out
fact
seemed
matters
were
quite
hopeless
for
every
mention
the
young
countess
rostova
the
old
prince
who
apart
from
that
was
usually
bad
temper
lost
control
himself
another
lately
added
sorrow
arose
from
the
lessons
she
gave
her
six
year
old
nephew
her
consternation
she
detected
herself
relation
little
nicholas
some
symptoms
her
father
irritability
however
often
she
told
herself
that
she
must
not
get
irritable
when
teaching
her
nephew
almost
every
time
that
pointer
hand
she
sat
down
show
him
the
french
alphabet
she
longed
pour
her
own
knowledge
quickly
and
easily
into
the
child
who
was
already
afraid
that
auntie
might
any
moment
get
angry
that
his
slightest
inattention
she
trembled
became
flustered
and
heated
raised
her
voice
and
sometimes
pulled
him
the
arm
and
put
him
the
corner
having
put
him
the
corner
she
would
herself
begin
cry
over
her
cruel
evil
nature
and
little
nicholas
following
her
example
would
sob
and
without
permission
would
leave
his
corner
come
her
pull
her
wet
hands
from
her
face
and
comfort
her
but
what
distressed
the
princess
most
all
was
her
father
irritability
which
was
always
directed
against
her
and
had
late
amounted
cruelty
had
forced
her
prostrate
herself
the
ground
all
night
had
beaten
her
made
her
fetch
wood
water
would
never
have
entered
her
mind
think
her
position
hard
but
this
loving
despot
the
more
cruel
because
loved
her
and
for
that
reason
tormented
himself
and
her
knew
how
not
merely
hurt
and
humiliate
her
deliberately
but
show
her
that
she
was
always
blame
for
everything
late
had
exhibited
new
trait
that
tormented
princess
mary
more
than
anything
else
this
was
his
ever
increasing
intimacy
with
mademoiselle
bourienne
the
idea
that
the
first
moment
receiving
the
news
his
son
intentions
had
occurred
him
jest
that
andrew
got
married
himself
would
marry
bourienne
had
evidently
pleased
him
and
latterly
had
persistently
and
seemed
princess
mary
merely
offend
her
shown
special
endearments
the
companion
and
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
with
his
daughter
demonstrations

bourienne
one
day

she
thought
her
father
did
purposely
when
she
was
there
the
old
prince
kissed
mademoiselle
bourienne
hand
and
drawing
her
him
embraced
her
affectionately
princess
mary
flushed
and
ran
out
the
room
few
minutes
later
mademoiselle
bourienne
came
into
princess
mary
room
smiling
and
making
cheerful
remarks
her
agreeable
voice
princess
mary
hastily
wiped
away
her
tears
went
resolutely
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
evidently
unconscious
what
she
was
doing
began
shouting
angry
haste
the
frenchwoman
her
voice
breaking
horrible
vile
inhuman
take
advantage
the
weakness
she
did
not
finish
leave
room
she
exclaimed
and
burst
into
sobs
next
day
the
prince
did
not
say
word
his
daughter
but
she
noticed
that
dinner
gave
orders
that
mademoiselle
bourienne
should
served
first
after
dinner
when
the
footman
handed
coffee
and
from
habit
began
with
the
princess
the
prince
suddenly
grew
furious
threw
his
stick
philip
and
instantly
gave
instructions

him
conscripted
for
the
army

said
twice
and
doesn
obey
she
the
first
person

cried
the
prince
and

for
the
first
time

yourself
again
before
her
you
dared
yesterday

show
you
who

princess
mary
asked
mademoiselle
bourienne
pardon
and
also
her
father
pardon
for
herself
and
for
philip
the
footman
who
had
begged
for
her
intervention
such
moments
something
like
pride
sacrifice
gathered
her
soul
and
suddenly
that
father
whom
she
had
judged
would
look
for
his
spectacles
her
presence
fumbling
near
them
and
not
seeing
them
would
forget
something
that
had
just
occurred
take
false
step
with
his
failing
legs
and
turn
see
anyone
had
noticed
his
feebleness
worst
all
dinner
when
there
were
visitors

him
would
suddenly
fall
asleep
letting
his
napkin
drop
and
his
shaking
head
sink
over
his
plate
old
and
feeble
and
dare
condemn
him
she
thought
such
moments
with
feeling
revulsion
against
herself

was
flung
open
and
the
threshold
appeared
the
handsome
figure
the
terrified
metivier
with
his
shock
black
hair
and
the
prince
his
dressing
gown
and
fez
his
face
distorted
with
fury
and
the
pupils
his
eyes
rolled
downwards

the
prince
but
french
spy

buonaparte

metivier
shrugging
his
shoulders
went
mademoiselle

room
the
prince
not
very
well
bile
and
rush

tomorrow
said
metivier
and
putting
his
fingers
his
lips
hastened
away
through
the
study
door
came
the
sound
slippered
feet
and
the
cry
spies
traitors
traitors
everywhere
not
moment
peace
own
house
after
metivier
departure
the
old
prince
called
his
daughter
and
the
whole
weight
his
wrath
fell
her
she
was
blame
that
spy
had
been
admitted
had
not
told
her
yes
told
her
make
list
and
not
admit
anyone
who
was
not

list
then
why

and
could
not

said
and
left
the
room
then
afraid
she
might
find
some
means
consolation
returned
and
trying
appear
calm
added
and
don
imagine
have
said
this
moment

have
thought
over
and
will

out
must

find
some
place
for

but
could
not
restrain
himself
and
with
the
virulence
which
only
one
who
loves
capable
evidently
suffering
himself
shook
his
fists
her
and
screamed
only
some
fool
would
marry
her
then
slammed
the
door
sent
for
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
subsided
into
his
study
two
clock
the
six
chosen
guests
assembled
for
dinner
these
guests
the
famous
count
rostopchin
prince
lopukhin
with
his
nephew
general
chatrov
old
war
comrade
the
prince
and
the
younger
generation
pierre
and
boris
drubetskoy
awaited
the
prince
the
drawing
room
boris
who
had
come
moscow
leave
few
days
before
had
been
anxious
presented
prince
nicholas
bolkonski
and
had
contrived
ingratiate
himself
well
that
the
old
prince
his
case
made
exception
the
rule
not
receiving
bachelors
his
house
the
prince
house
did
not
belong
what
known
fashionable
society
but
his
little
circle
though
not
much
talked
about
town
was
one
was
more
flattering
received
than
any
other
boris
had
realized
this
the
week
before
when
the
commander
chief
his
presence
invited
rostopchin
dinner
nicholas
day
and
rostopchin
had
replied
that
could
not
come
that
day
always
pay
devotions
the
relics
prince
nicholas
bolkonski
yes
yes
replied
the
commander
chief
how
the
small
group
that
assembled
before
dinner
the
lofty
old
fashioned
drawing
room
with
its
old
furniture
resembled
the
solemn
gathering
court
justice
all
were
silent
talked
low
tones
prince
nicholas
came
serious
and
taciturn
princess
mary
seemed
even
quieter
and
more
diffident
than
usual
the
guests
were
reluctant
address
her
feeling
that
she
was
mood
for
their
conversation
count
rostopchin
alone
kept
the
conversation
going
now
relating
the
latest
town
news
and
now
the
latest
political
gossip
lopukhin
and
the
old
general
occasionally
took
part
the
conversation
prince
bolkonski
listened
presiding
judge
receives
report
only
now
and
then
silently
brief
word
showing
that
took
heed
what
was
being
reported
him
the
tone
the
conversation
was
such
indicated
that
one
approved
what
was
being
done
the
political
world
incidents
were
related
evidently
confirming
the
opinion
that
everything
was
going
from
bad
worse
but
whether
telling
story
giving
opinion
the
speaker
always
stopped
was
stopped
the
point
beyond
which
his
criticism
might
touch
the
sovereign
himself
dinner
the
talk
turned
the
latest
political
news
napoleon
seizure
the
duke
oldenburg
territory
and
the
russian
note
hostile
napoleon
which
had
been
sent
all
the
european
courts
bonaparte
treats
europe
pirate
does
captured
vessel
said
count
rostopchin
repeating
phrase
had
uttered
several
times
before
one
only
wonders
the
long
suffering
blindness
the
crowned
heads
now
the
pope
turn
has
come
and
bonaparte
doesn
scruple
depose
the
head
the
catholic
church
yet
all
keep
silent
our
sovereign
alone
has
protested
against
the
seizure
the
duke
oldenburg
territory
and
even
count
rostopchin
paused
feeling
that
had
reached
the
limit
beyond
which
censure
was
impossible
other
territories
have
been
offered
exchange
for
the
duchy
oldenburg
said
prince
bolkonski
shifts
the
dukes
about
might
move
serfs
from
bald
hills
bogucharovo
ryazan
estates
the
duke
oldenburg
bears
his
misfortunes
with
admirable
strength
character
and
resignation
remarked
boris
joining
respectfully
said
this
because
his
journey
from
petersburg
had
had
the
honor
being
presented
the
duke
prince
bolkonski
glanced
the
young
man
about
say
something
reply
but
changed
his
mind
evidently
considering
him
too
young
have
read
our
protests
about
the
oldenburg
affair
and
was
surprised
how
badly
the
note
was
worded
remarked
count
rostopchin
the
casual
tone
man
dealing
with
subject
quite
familiar
him
pierre
looked
rostopchin
with
naive
astonishment
not
understanding
why
should
disturbed
the
bad
composition
the
note
does
matter
count
how
the
note
worded
asked
long
its
substance
forcible
dear
fellow
with
our
five
hundred
thousand
troops
should
easy
have
good
style
returned
count
rostopchin
pierre
now
understood
the
count
dissatisfaction
with
the
wording
the
note
one
would
have
thought
quill
drivers
enough
had
sprung
remarked
the
old
prince
there
petersburg
they
are
always
writing
not
notes
only
but
even
new
laws
andrew
there
has
written
whole
volume
laws
for
russia
nowadays
they
are
always
writing
and
laughed
unnaturally
there
was
momentary
pause
the
conversation
the
old
general
cleared
his
throat
draw
attention
did
you
hear
the
last
event
the
review
petersburg
the
figure
cut
the
new
french
ambassador
yes
heard
something
said
something
awkward
his
majesty
presence
his
majesty
drew
attention
the
grenadier
division
and
the
march
past
continued
the
general
and
seems
the
ambassador
took
notice
and
allowed
himself
reply
that
france
pay
attention
such
trifles
the
emperor
did
not
condescend
reply
the
next
review
they
say
the
emperor
did
not
once
deign
address
him
all
were
silent
this
fact
relating
the
emperor
personally
was
impossible
pass
any
judgment
impudent
fellows
said
the
prince
you
know
metivier
turned
him
out
house
this
morning
was
here
they
admitted
him
spite
request
that
they
should
let
one
went
glancing
angrily
his
daughter
and
narrated
his
whole
conversation
with
the
french
doctor
and
the
reasons
that
convinced
him
that
metivier
was
spy
though
these
reasons
were
very
insufficient
and
obscure
one
made
any
rejoinder
after
the
roast
champagne
was
served
the
guests
rose
congratulate
the
old
prince
princess
mary
too
went
round
him
gave
her
cold
angry
look
and
offered
her
his
wrinkled
clean

cheek
kiss
the
whole
expression
his
face
told
her
that
had
not
forgotten
the
morning
talk
that
his
decision
remained
force
and
only
the
presence
visitors
hindered
his
speaking

now
when
they
went
into
the
drawing
room
where
coffee
was
served
the
old
men
sat
together
prince
nicholas
grew
more
animated
and
expressed
his
views

that
our
wars
with
bonaparte
would
disastrous
long
sought
alliances
with
the
germans
and
thrust
ourselves
into
european
affairs
into
which

been
drawn
the
peace
tilsit

our

and
regard
bonaparte
the
only
thing

and
firm
policy
and

the
case

and

pierre
gaiety
vanished
completely
anxiously
questioned
the
princess
asked
her

out
fully
and
confide
her
grief
him
but
she
only
repeated
that
she
begged
him

what
she
had
said
that
she
did
not
remember
what
she
had
said
and
that
she

time
said
princess
mary
tell

the
whole
truth

what

the
real
truth
because
you

andrew
risking
much

against
his
father
will
that

undefined
instinct
told
pierre
that
these
explanations
and
repeated
requests
told
the
whole
truth
expressed
ill
will
the
princess
part
toward
her
future
sister
law
and
wish
that
should
disapprove
andrew
choice
but
reply
said
what

rather
than

how
answer
your
question
said
blushing
without
knowing
why
really
don
know
what
sort
girl
she
can
analyze
her
all
she
enchanting
but
what
makes
her
don
know
that
all
one
can
say
about
her
princess
mary
sighed
and
the
expression
her
face
said
yes
that
what
expected
and
feared
she
clever
she
asked
pierre
considered
think
not
said
and
yet
yes
she
does
not
deign
clever
she
simply
enchanting
and
that
all
princess
mary
again
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
long
like
her
tell
her
you
see
her
before
hear
they
are
expected
very
soon
said
pierre
princess
mary
told
pierre
her
plan
become
intimate
with
her
future
sister
law
soon
the
rostovs
arrived
and
try
accustom
the
old
prince
her
chapter
boris
had
not
succeeded
making
wealthy
match
petersburg
with
the
same
object
view
came
moscow
there
wavered
between
the
two
richest
heiresses
julie
and
princess
mary
though
princess
mary
despite
her
plainness
seemed
him
more
attractive
than
julie
without
knowing
why
felt
awkward
about
paying
court
her
when
they
had
last
met
the
old
prince
name
day
she
had
answered
random
all
his
attempts
talk
sentimentally
evidently
not
listening
what
was
saying
julie
the
contrary
accepted
his
attentions
readily
though
manner
peculiar
herself
she
was
twenty
seven
after
the
death
her
brothers
she
had
become
very
wealthy
she
was
now
decidedly
plain
but
thought
herself
not
merely
good
looking
before
but
even
far
more
attractive
she
was
confirmed
this
delusion
the
fact
that
she
had
become
very
wealthy
heiress
and
also
the
fact
that
the
older
she
grew
the
less
dangerous
she
became
men
and
the
more
freely
they
could
associate
with
her
and
avail
themselves
her
suppers
soirees
and
the
animated
company
that
assembled
her
house
without
incurring
any
obligation
man
who
would
have
been
afraid
ten
years
before
going
every
day
the
house
when
there
was
girl
seventeen
there
for
fear
compromising
her
and
committing
himself
would
now
boldly
every
day
and
treat
her
not
marriageable
girl
but
sexless
acquaintance
that
winter
the
karagins
house
was
the
most
agreeable
and
hospitable
moscow
addition
the
formal
evening
and
dinner
parties
large
company
chiefly
men
gathered
there
every
day
supping
midnight
and
staying
till
three
the
morning
julie
never
missed
ball
promenade
play
her
dresses
were
always
the
latest
fashion
but
spite
that
she
seemed
disillusioned
about
everything
and
told
everyone
that
she
did
not
believe
either
friendship
love
any
the
joys
life
and
expected
peace
only
yonder
she
adopted
the
tone
one
who
has
suffered
great
disappointment
like
girl
who
has
either
lost
the
man
she
loved
been
cruelly
deceived
him
though
nothing
the
kind
had
happened
her
she
was
regarded
that
light
and
had
even
herself
come
believe
that
she
had
suffered
much
life
this
melancholy
which
did
not
prevent
her
amusing
herself
did
not
hinder
the
young
people
who
came
her
house
from
passing
the
time
pleasantly
every
visitor
who
came
the
house
paid
his
tribute
the
melancholy
mood
the
hostess
and
then
amused
himself
with
society
gossip
dancing
intellectual
games
and
bouts
rimes
which
were
vogue
the
karagins
only
few
these
young
men
among
them
boris
entered
more
deeply
into
julie
melancholy
and
with
these
she
had
prolonged
conversations
private
the
vanity
all
worldly
things
and
them
she
showed
her
albums
filled
with
mournful
sketches
maxims
and
verses
boris
julie
was
particularly
gracious
she
regretted
his
early
disillusionment
with
life
offered
him
such
consolation
friendship
she
who
had
herself
suffered
much
could
render
and
showed
him
her
album
boris
sketched
two
trees
the
album
and
wrote
rustic
trees
your
dark
branches
shed
gloom
and
melancholy
upon
another
page
drew

and
wrote

julie
played
most
doleful
nocturnes
her
harp
boris
read
poor
liza
aloud
her
and
more
than
once
interrupted
the
reading
because
the
emotions
that
choked
him
meeting
large
gatherings
julie
and
boris
looked
one
another
the
only
souls
who
understood
one
another
world
indifferent
people
anna
mikhaylovna
who
often
visited
the
karagins
while
playing
cards
with
the
mother
made
careful
inquiries
julie
dowry
she
was
have
two
estates
penza
and
the
nizhegorod
forests
anna
mikhaylovna
regarded
the
refined
sadness
that
united
her
son
the
wealthy
julie
with
emotion
and
resignation
the
divine
will
you
are
always
charming
and
melancholy
dear
julie
she
said
the
daughter
boris
says
his
soul
finds
repose
your
house
has
suffered
many
disappointments
and
sensitive
said
she
the
mother
dear
can
tell
you
how
fond
have
grown
julie
latterly
she
said
her
son
but
who
could
help
loving
her
she
angelic
being
boris
boris
she
paused
and
how
pity
her
mother
she
went
today
she
showed
her
accounts
and
letters
from
penza
they
have
enormous
estates
there
and
she
poor
thing
has
one
help
her
and
they
cheat
her
boris
smiled
almost
imperceptibly
while
listening
his
mother
laughed
blandly
her
naive
diplomacy
but
listened
what
she
had
say
and
sometimes
questioned
her
carefully
about
the
penza
and
nizhegorod
estates
julie
had
long
been
expecting
proposal
from
her
melancholy
adorer
and
was
ready
accept
but
some
secret
feeling
repulsion
for
her
for
her
passionate
desire
get
married
for
her
artificiality
and
feeling
horror
renouncing
the
possibility
real
love
still
restrained
boris
his
leave
was
expiring
spent
every
day
and
whole
days
the
karagins
and
every
day
thinking
the
matter
over
told
himself
that
would
propose
tomorrow
but
julie
presence
looking
her
red
face
and
chin
nearly
always
powdered
her
moist
eyes
and
her
expression
continual
readiness
pass
once
from
melancholy
unnatural
rapture
married
bliss
boris
could
not
utter
the
decisive
words
though
imagination
had
long
regarded
himself
the
possessor
those
penza
and
nizhegorod
estates
and
had
apportioned
the
use
the
income
from
them
julie
saw
boris
indecision
and
sometimes
the
thought
occurred
her
that
she
was
repulsive
him
but
her
feminine
self
deception
immediately
supplied
her
with
consolation
and
she
told
herself
that
was
only
shy
from
love
her
melancholy
however
began
turn
irritability
and
not
long
before
boris
departure
she
formed
definite
plan
action
just
boris
leave
absence
was
expiring
anatole
kuragin
made
his
appearance
moscow
and
course
the
karagins
drawing
room
and
julie
suddenly
abandoning
her
melancholy
became
cheerful
and
very
attentive
kuragin
dear
said
anna
mikhaylovna
her
son
know
from
reliable
source
that
prince
vasili
has
sent
his
son
moscow
get
him
married
julie
fond
julie
that
should
sorry
for
her
what
you
think
dear
the
idea
being
made
fool
and
having
thrown
away
that
whole
month
arduous
melancholy
service
julie
and
seeing
all
the
revenue
from
the
penza
estates
which
had
already
mentally
apportioned
and
put
proper
use
fall
into
the
hands
another
and
especially
into
the
hands
that
idiot
anatole
pained
boris
drove
the
karagins
with
the
firm
intention
proposing
julie
met
him
gay
careless
manner
spoke
casually
how
she
had
enjoyed
yesterday
ball
and
asked
when
was
leaving
though
boris
had
come
intentionally
speak
his
love
and
therefore
meant
tender
began
speaking
irritably
feminine
inconstancy
how
easily
women
can
turn
from
sadness
joy
and
how
their
moods
depend
solely
who
happens
paying
court
them
julie
was
offended
and
replied
that
was
true
that
woman
needs
variety
and
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
would
weary
anyone
then
should
advise
you
boris
began
wishing
sting
her
but
that
instant
the
galling
thought
occurred
him
that
might
have
leave
moscow
without
having
accomplished
his
aim
and
have
vainly
wasted
his
efforts
which
was
thing
never
allowed
happen
checked
himself
the
middle
the
sentence
lowered
his
eyes
avoid
seeing
her
unpleasantly
irritated
and
irresolute
face
and
said
did
not
come
here
all
quarrel
with
you
the
contrary
glanced
her
make
sure
that
might
her
irritability
had
suddenly
quite
vanished
and
her
anxious
imploring
eyes
were
fixed
him
with
greedy
expectation
can
always
arrange
not
see
her
often
thought
boris
the
affair
has
been
begun
and
must
finished
blushed
hotly
raised
his
eyes
hers
and
said
you
know
feelings
for
you
there
was
need
say
more
julie
face
shone
with
triumph
and
self
satisfaction
but
she
forced
boris
say
all
that
said
such
occasions
that
loved
her
and
had
never
loved
any
other
woman
more
than
her
she
knew
that
for
the
penza
estates
and
nizhegorod
forests
she
could
demand
this
and
she
received
what
she
demanded

because

advice
count
rostov
took
natasha
call
prince
nicholas
bolkonski
the
count
did
not
set
out
cheerfully
this
visit
heart
felt
afraid
well
remembered
the
last
interview
had
had
with
the
old
prince
the
time
the
enrollment
when
reply
invitation
dinner
had
had
listen
angry
reprimand
for
not
having
provided
his
full
quota
men
natasha
the
other
hand
having
put
her
best
gown
was
the
highest
spirits
they
can
help
liking
she
thought
everybody
always
has
liked
and
willing
anything
they
wish
ready
fond
him
for
being
his
father
and
her
for
being
his
sister
that
there
reason
for
them
not
like
they
drove
the
gloomy
old
house
the
vozdvizhenka
and
entered
the
vestibule
well
the
lord
have
mercy
said
the
count
half
jest
half
earnest
but
natasha
noticed
that
her
father
was
flurried
entering
the
anteroom
and
inquired
timidly
and
softly
whether
the
prince
and
princess
were
home
when
they
had
been
announced
perturbation
was
noticeable
among
the
servants
the
footman
who
had
gone
announce
them
was
stopped
another
the
large
hall
and
they
whispered
one
another
then
maidservant
ran
into
the
hall
and
hurriedly
said
something
mentioning
the
princess
last
old
cross
looking
footman
came
and
announced
the
rostovs
that
the
prince
was
not
receiving
but
that
the
princess
begged
them
walk
the
first
person
who
came
meet
the
visitors
was
mademoiselle
bourienne
she
greeted
the
father
and
daughter
with
special
politeness
and
showed
them
the
princess
room
the
princess
looking
excited
and
nervous
her
face
flushed
patches
ran
meet
the
visitors
treading
heavily
and
vainly
trying
appear
cordial
and
ease
from
the
first
glance
princess
mary
did
not
like
natasha
she
thought
her
too
fashionably
dressed
frivolously
gay
and
vain
she
did
not
all
realize
that
before
having
seen
her
future
sister
law
she
was
prejudiced
against
her
involuntary
envy
her
beauty
youth
and
happiness
well
jealousy
her
brother
love
for
her
apart
from
this
insuperable
antipathy
her
princess
mary
was
agitated
just
then
because
the
rostovs
being
announced
the
old
prince
had
shouted
that
did
not
wish
see
them
that
princess
mary
might
she
chose
but
they
were
not
admitted
him
she
had
decided
receive
them
but
feared
lest
the
prince
might
any
moment
indulge
some
freak
seemed
much
upset
the
rostovs
visit
there
dear
princess
brought
you
songstress
said
the
count
bowing
and
looking
round
uneasily
afraid
the
old
prince
might
appear
glad
you
should
get
know
one
another
very
sorry
the
prince
still
ailing
and
after
few
more
commonplace
remarks
rose
you
allow
leave
natasha
your
hands
for
quarter
hour
princess
drive
round
see
anna
semenovna
quite
near
the
dogs
square
and
then
come
back
for
her
the
count
had
devised
this
diplomatic
ruse
afterwards
told
his
daughter
give
the
future
sisters
law
opportunity
talk
one
another
freely
but
another
motive
was
avoid
the
danger
encountering
the
old
prince
whom
was
afraid
did
not
mention
this
his
daughter
but
natasha
noticed
her
father
nervousness
and
anxiety
and
felt
mortified
she
blushed
for
him
grew
still
angrier
having
blushed
and
looked
the
princess
with
bold
and
defiant
expression
which
said
that
she
was
not
afraid
anybody
the
princess
told
the
count
that
she
would
delighted
and
only
begged
him
stay
longer
anna
semenovna
and
departed
despite
the
uneasy
glances
thrown
her
princess
mary
who
wished
have
tête
tête
with
natasha
mademoiselle
bourienne
remained
the
room
and
persistently
talked
about
moscow
amusements
and
theaters
natasha
felt
offended
the
hesitation
she
had
noticed
the
anteroom
her
father
nervousness
and
the
unnatural
manner
the
princess
who
she
thought
was
making
favor
receiving
her
and
everything
displeased
her
she
did
not
like
princess
mary
whom
she
thought
very
plain
affected
and
dry
natasha
suddenly
shrank
into
herself
and
involuntarily
assumed
offhand
air
which
alienated
princess
mary
still
more
after
five
minutes
irksome
constrained
conversation
they
heard
the
sound
slippered
feet
rapidly
approaching
princess
mary
looked
frightened
the
door
opened
and
the
old
prince
dressing
gown
and
white
nightcap

repeated
stressing
the
word
god
unnaturally
and
unpleasantly
that
princess
mary
stood
with
downcast
eyes
not
daring
look
either
her
father
natasha
nor
did
the
latter
having
risen
and
curtsied
know
what
mademoiselle
bourienne
alone
smiled
agreeably
beg
you
excuse
excuse
god
witness
did
not
know
muttered
the
old
man
and
after
looking
natasha
over
from
head
foot
went
out
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
the
first
recover
herself
after
this
apparition
and
began
speaking
about
the
prince
indisposition
natasha
and
princess
mary
looked
one
another
silence
and
the
longer
they
did
without
saying
what
they
wanted
say
the
greater
grew
their
antipathy
one
another
when
the
count
returned
natasha
was
impolitely
pleased
and
hastened
get
away
that
moment
she
hated
the
stiff
elderly
princess
who
could
place
her
such
embarrassing
position
and
had
spent
half
hour
with
her
without
once
mentioning
prince
andrew
couldn
begin
talking
about
him
the
presence
that
frenchwoman
thought
natasha
the
same
thought
was
meanwhile
tormenting
princess
mary
she
knew
what
she
ought
have
said
natasha
but
she
had
been
unable
say
because
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
the
way
and
because
without
knowing
why
she
felt
very
difficult
speak
the
marriage
when
the
count
was
already
leaving
the
room
princess
mary
went
hurriedly
natasha
took
her
the
hand
and
said
with
deep
sigh
wait
must
natasha
glanced
her
ironically
without
knowing
why
dear
natalie
said
princess
mary
want
you
know
that
glad
brother
has
found
happiness
she
paused
feeling
that
she
was
not
telling
the
truth
natasha
noticed
this
and
guessed
its
reason
think
princess
not
convenient
speak
that
now
she
said
with
external
dignity
and
coldness
though
she
felt
the
tears
choking
her
what
have
said
and
what
have
done
thought
she
soon
she
was
out
the
room
they
waited
long
time
for
natasha
come
dinner
that
day
she
sat
her
room
crying
like
child
blowing
her
nose
and
sobbing
sonya
stood
beside
her
kissing
her
hair
natasha
what
about
she
asked
what
they
matter

natasha
but
you
only
knew
how

sonya
natasha

her

pressed
her
wet
face
against

and

resolutely
and
loudly

and
the
other

chapter
viii
that
evening
the
rostovs
went

opera
for
which
marya
dmitrievna
had
taken
box
natasha
did
not
want
but
could
not
refuse
marya
dmitrievna
kind
offer
which
was
intended
expressly
for
her
when
she
came
ready
dressed
into
the
ballroom
await
her
father
and
looking
the
large
mirror
there
saw
that
she
was
pretty
very
pretty
she
felt
even
more
sad
but
was
sweet
tender
sadness
god
were
here
now
would
not
behave
did
then
but
differently
would
not
silly
and
afraid
things
would
simply
embrace
him
cling
him
and
make
him
look
with
those
searching
inquiring
eyes
with
which
has
often
looked
and
then
would
make
him
laugh
used
laugh
and
his
eyes
how
see
those
eyes
thought
natasha
and
what
his
father
and
sister
matter
love
him
alone
him
him
with
that
face
and
those
eyes
with
his

childlike

him
but
forget
him
quite
forget
him
for
the
present

bear
this
waiting
and
shall
cry
minute
and
she
turned
away
from
the
glass
making
effort
not
cry
and
how
can
sonya
love
nicholas
calmly
and
quietly
and
wait
long
and
patiently
thought
she
looking
sonya
who
also
came
quite
ready
with
fan
her
hand
she
altogether
different
can
natasha
that
moment
felt
softened
and
tender
that
was
not
enough
for
her
love
and
know
she
was
beloved
she
wanted
now
once
embrace
the
man
she
loved
speak
and
hear
from
him
words
love
such
filled
her
heart
while
she
sat
the
carriage
beside
her
father
pensively
watching
the
lights
the
street
lamps
flickering
the
frozen
window
she
felt
still
sadder
and
more
love
and
forgot
where
she
was
going
and
with
whom
having
fallen
into
the
line
carriages
the
rostovs
carriage
drove
the
theater
its
wheels

the

and
through

natasha
smoothing
her

went
with
sonya
and
sat
down
scanning
the
brilliant
tiers
boxes
opposite
sensation
she
had
not
experienced
for
long
time
that
hundreds
eyes
looking
her
bare
arms
and
neck
suddenly
affected
her
both
agreeably
and
disagreeably
and
called
whole
crowd
memories
desires
and
emotions
associated
with
that
feeling
the
two
remarkably
pretty
girls
natasha
and
sonya
with
count
rostov
who
had
not
been
seen

for
long
time

general
attention

beauty
combined
with
her
indifference
everything
about
her
her
black
eyes
looked
the
crowd
without
seeking
anyone
and
her
delicate
arm
bare
above
the
elbow
lay
the
velvet
edge
the
box
while
evidently
unconsciously
she
opened
and
closed
her
hand

with
mass
plaited
hair
and
much
exposed
plump
white
shoulders
and
neck
round
which
she
wore
double
string
large
pearls
entered
the
adjoining
box
rustling
her
heavy
silk
dress
and
took
long
time
settling
into
her
place
natasha
involuntarily
gazed
that
neck
those
shoulders
and
pearls
and
coiffure
and
admired
the
beauty
the
shoulders
and
the
pearls
while
natasha
was
fixing
her
gaze
her
for
the
second
time
the
lady
looked
round
and
meeting
the
count
eyes
nodded
him
and
smiled
she
was
the
countess
bezukhova
pierre
wife
and
the
count
who

over
and

helene
and
glanced
attentively
natasha
count

resumed
his
seat
handsome
isn
she
whispered
natasha
wonderful
answered
natasha
she
woman
one
could
easily
fall
love
with
just
then
the
last
chords
the
overture
were
heard
and
the
conductor
tapped
with
his
stick
some
latecomers
took
their
seats
the
stalls
and
the
curtain
rose
soon
rose
everyone
the
boxes
and
stalls
became
silent
and
all
the
men
old
and
young
uniform
and
evening
dress
and
all
the
women
with
gems
their
bare
flesh
turned
their
whole
attention
with
eager
curiosity
the
stage
natasha
too
began
look
chapter
the
floor
the
stage
consisted
smooth
boards
the
sides
was
some
painted
cardboard
representing
trees
and
the
back
was
cloth
stretched
over
boards
the
center
the
stage
sat
some
girls
red
bodices
and
white
skirts
one
very
fat
girl
white
silk
dress
sat
apart
low
bench
the
back
which
piece
green
cardboard
was
glued
they
all
sang
something
when
they
had
finished
their
song
the
girl
white
went
the
prompter
box
and
man
with
tight
silk
trousers
over
his
stout
legs
and
holding
plume
and
dagger
went
her
and
began
singing
waving
his
arms
about
first
the
man
the
tight
trousers
sang
alone
then
she
sang
then
they
both
paused
while
the
orchestra
played
and
the
man
fingered
the
hand
the
girl
white
obviously
awaiting
the
beat
start
singing
with
her
they
sang
together
and
everyone
the
theater
began
clapping
and
shouting
while
the
man
and
woman
the
stage
who
represented
lovers
began
smiling
spreading
out
their
arms
and
bowing
after
her
life
the
country
and
her
present
serious
mood
all
this
seemed
grotesque
and
amazing
natasha
she
could
not
follow
the
opera
nor
even
listen
the
music
she
saw
only
the
painted
cardboard
and
the
queerly
dressed
men
and
women
who
moved
spoke
and
sang
strangely
that
brilliant
light
she
knew
what
was
all
meant
represent
but
was
pretentiously
false
and
unnatural
that
she
first
felt
ashamed
for
the
actors
and
then
amused
them
she
looked
the
faces
the
audience
seeking
them
the
same
sense
ridicule
and
perplexity
she
herself
experienced
but
they
all
seemed
attentive
what
was
happening
the
stage
and
expressed
delight
which
natasha
seemed
feigned
suppose
has
like
this
she
thought
she
kept
looking
round
turn
the
rows
pomaded
heads
the
stalls
and
then
the
seminude
women
the
boxes
especially
helene
the
next
box
who
apparently
quite
unclothed
sat
with
quiet
tranquil
smile
not
taking
her
eyes
off
the
stage
and
feeling
the
bright
light
that
flooded
the
whole
place
and
the
warm
air
heated
the
crowd
natasha
little
little
began
pass
into
state
intoxication
she
had
not
experienced
for
long
while
she
did
not
realize
who
and
where
she
was
nor
what
was
going
before
her
she
looked
and
thought
the
strangest
fancies
unexpectedly
and
disconnectedly
passed
through
her
mind
the
idea
occurred
her
jumping
onto
the
edge
the
box
and
singing
the
air
the
actress
was
singing
then
she
wished
touch
with
her
fan
old
gentleman
sitting
not
far
from
her
then
lean
over
helene
and
tickle
her
moment
when
all
was
quiet
before
the
commencement
song
door
leading
the
stalls
the
side
nearest
the
rostovs
box
creaked
and
the
steps
belated

were
heard
there
kuragin
whispered
shinshin
countess
bezukhova
turned
smiling
the
newcomer
and
natasha
following
the
direction
that
look
saw
exceptionally
handsome
adjutant
approaching
their
box
with
self
assured
yet
courteous
bearing
this
was
anatole
kuragin
whom
she
had
seen
and
noticed
long
ago
the
ball
petersburg
was
now
adjutant
uniform
with
one
epaulet
and
shoulder
knot
moved
with
restrained
swagger
which
would
have
been
ridiculous
had
not
been
good
looking
and
had
his
handsome
face
not
worn
such
expression
good
humored
complacency
and
gaiety
though
the
performance
was
proceeding
walked
deliberately
down
the
carpeted
gangway
his
sword
and
spurs
slightly
jingling
and
his
handsome
perfumed
head
held
high
having
looked
natasha
approached
his
sister
laid
his
well
gloved
hand
the
edge
her
box
nodded
her
and
leaning
forward
asked
question
with
motion
toward
natasha
mais
charmante
said
evidently
referring
natasha
who
did
not
exactly
hear
his
words
but
understood
them
from
the
movement
his
lips
then
took
his
place
the
first
row
the
stalls
and
sat
down
beside
dolokhov
nudging
with
his
elbow
friendly
and
offhand
way
that
dolokhov
whom
others
treated
fawningly
winked
him
gaily
smiled
and
rested
his
foot
against
the
orchestra
screen
how
like
the
brother
the
sister
remarked
the
count
and
how
handsome
they
both
are
shinshin
lowering
his
voice
began
tell
the
count
some
intrigue
kuragin
moscow
and
natasha
tried
overhear
just
because
had
said
she
was
charmante
the
first
act
was
over
the
stalls
everyone
began
moving
about
going
out
and
coming

their
congratulations
very
simply
and
raising
his
eyebrows
with
absent
minded
smile
conveyed
natasha
and
sonya
his
fiancee
invitation

wedding
and
went
away
natasha
with
gay
coquettish
smile
talked
him
and
congratulated
his
approaching
wedding

same
boris
with
whom
she
had
formerly
been

natasha
gave

similar
smile

filled
and
surrounded
from

the
most
distinguished
and
intellectual

wish
let
everyone
see
that

partition
looking

natasha
knew

talking
about
her
and
this
afforded
her
pleasure
she
even
turned
that
should
see
her
profile
what
she
thought
was
its
most
becoming
aspect
before
the
beginning
the
second
act

the
rostovs

not
seen
him
since
their
arrival

looked
sad

had
grown
still
stouter
since

saw
him
passed

noticing
anyone
anatole
went

and
began
speaking

animated
and
hastily
passing
between

such
enraptured
caressing

and
from
horns
and
contrabass
came
deep
notes
while
many
people
appeared
from
right
and
left
wearing
black
cloaks
and
holding
things
like
daggers
their
hands
they
began
waving
their
arms
then
some
other
people
ran
and
began
dragging
away
the
maiden
who
had
been
white
and
was
now
light
blue
they
did
not
drag
her
away
once
but
sang
with
her
for
long
time
and
then
last
dragged
her
off
and
behind
the
scenes
something
metallic
was
struck
three
times
and
everyone
knelt
down
and
sang
prayer
all
these
things
were
repeatedly
interrupted
the
enthusiastic
shouts
the
audience
during
this
act
every
time
natasha
looked
toward
the
stalls
she
saw
anatole
kuragin
with
arm
thrown
across
the
back
his
chair
staring
her
she
was
pleased
see
that
was
captivated
her
and
did
not
occur
her
that
there
was
anything
wrong
when
the
second
act
was
over

get
better
acquainted
she
asked
that
one
the
young
ladies
should
come
into
her
box
for
the
rest
the
performance
and
natasha
moved
over
the
scene
the
third

represented
palace
which
many
candles
were
burning
and
pictures
knights
with
short
beards
hung
the
walls
the
middle
stood
what
were
probably
king
and
queen
the
king
waved
his
right
arm
and
evidently
nervous
sang
something
badly
and
sat
down
crimson
throne
the
maiden
who
had
been
first
white
and
then
light
blue
now
wore
only
smock
and
stood
beside
the
throne
with
her
hair
down
she
sang
something
mournfully
addressing
the
queen
but
the
king
waved
his
arm
severely
and
men
and
women
with
bare
legs
came
from
both
sides
and
began
dancing
all
together
then
the
violins
played
very
shrilly
and
merrily
and
one
the
women
with
thick
bare
legs
and
thin
arms
separating
from
the
others
went
behind
the
wings
adjusted
her
bodice
returned
the
middle
the
stage
and
began
jumping
and
striking
one
foot
rapidly
against
the
other
the
stalls
everyone
clapped
and
shouted
bravo
then
one
the
men
went
into
corner
the
stage
the
cymbals
and
horns
the
orchestra
struck
more
loudly
and
this
man
with
bare
legs
jumped
very
high
and
waved
his
feet
about
very
rapidly
was
duport
who
received
sixty
thousand
rubles
year
for
this
art
everybody
the
stalls
boxes
and
galleries
began
clapping
and
shouting
with
all
their
might
and
the
man
stopped
and
began
smiling
and
bowing
all
sides
then
other
men
and
women
danced
with
bare
legs
then
the
king
again
shouted
the
sound
music
and
they
all
began
singing
but
suddenly
storm
came
chromatic
scales
and
diminished
sevenths
were
heard
the
orchestra
everyone
ran
off
again
dragging
one
their
number
away
and
the
curtain
dropped
once
more
there
was
terrible
noise
and
clatter
among
the
audience
and
with
rapturous
faces
everyone
began
shouting
duport
duport
duport
natasha
longer
thought
this
strange
she
looked
about
with
pleasure
smiling
joyfully
isn
duport
delightful
helene
asked
her
yes
replied
natasha
chapter
during
the
entr
acte
whiff
cold
air
came
into
helene
box
the
door
opened
and
anatole
entered
stooping
and
trying
not
brush
against
anyone
let
introduce
brother
you
said
helene
her
eyes
shifting
uneasily
from
natasha
anatole
natasha
turned
her
pretty
little
head
toward
the
elegant
young
officer
and
smiled
him
over
her
bare
shoulder
anatole
who
was
handsome
close
quarters
distance
sat
down
beside
her
and
told
her
had
long
wished
have
this
happiness
ever
since
the
naryshkins
ball
fact
which
had
had
the
well
remembered
pleasure
seeing
her
kuragin
was
much
more
sensible
and
simple
with
women
than
among
men
talked
boldly
and
naturally
and
natasha
was
strangely
and
agreeably
struck
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
formidable
this
man
about
whom
there
was
much
talk
but
that
the
contrary
his
smile
was
most
naive
cheerful
and
good
natured
kuragin
asked
her
opinion
the
performance
and
told
her
how
previous
performance
semenova
had
fallen
down
the
stage
and
you
know
countess
said
suddenly
addressing
her
old
familiar
acquaintance
are
getting
costume
tournament
you
ought
take
part
will
great
fun
shall
all
meet
the
karagins
please
come
really
said
while
saying
this
never
removed
his
smiling
eyes
from
her
face
her
neck
and
her
bare
arms
natasha
knew
for
certain
that
was
enraptured
her
this
pleased
her
yet
his
presence
made
her
feel
constrained
and
oppressed
when
she
was
not
looking
him
she
felt
that
was
looking
her
shoulders
and
she
involuntarily
caught
his
eye
that
should
look
into
hers
rather
than
this
but
looking
into
his
eyes
she
was
frightened
realizing
that
there
was
not
that
barrier
modesty
she
had
always
felt
between
herself
and
other
men
she
did
not
know
how
was
that
within
five
minutes
she
had
come
feel
herself
terribly
near
this
man
when
she
turned
away
she
feared
might
seize
her
from
behind
her
bare
arm
and
kiss
her
the
neck
they
spoke
most
ordinary
things
yet
she
felt
that
they
were
closer
one
another
than
she
had
ever
been
any
man
natasha
kept
turning
helene
and
her
father
asking
what
all
meant
but
helene
was
engaged
conversation
with
general
and
did
not
answer
her
look
and
her
father
eyes
said
nothing
but
what
they
always
said
having
good
time
well
glad
during
one
these
moments
awkward
silence
when
anatole
prominent
eyes
were
gazing
calmly
and
fixedly
her
natasha
break
the
silence
asked
him
how
liked
moscow
she
asked
the
question
and
blushed
she
felt
all
the
time
that
talking
him
she
was
doing
something
improper
anatole
smiled
though
encourage
her
first
did
not
like
much
because
what
makes
town
pleasant
sont
les
jolies
femmes
isn
that
but
now
like
very
much
indeed
said
looking
her
significantly
you
come
the
costume
tournament
countess
come
and
putting
out
his
hand
her
bouquet
and
dropping
his
voice
added
you
will
the
prettiest
there
come
dear
countess
and
give
this
flower
pledge
are
the
pretty
women
natasha
did
not
understand
what
was
saying
any
more
than
did
himself
but
she
felt
that
his
incomprehensible
words
had
improper
intention
she
did
not
know
what
say
and
turned
away
she
had
not
heard
his
remark
but
soon
she
had
turned
away
she
felt
that
was
there
behind
close
behind
her
how
now
confused
angry
ought
put
right
she
asked
herself
and
she
could
not
refrain
from
turning
round
she
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
and
his
nearness
self
assurance
and
the
good
natured
tenderness
his
smile
vanquished
her
she
smiled
just
was
doing
gazing
straight
into
his
eyes
and
again
she
felt
with
horror
that
barrier
lay
between
him
and
her
the
curtain
rose
again
anatole
left
the
box
serene
and
gay
natasha
went
back
her
father
the
other
box
now
quite
submissive
the
world
she
found
herself
all
that
was
going
before
her
now
seemed
quite
natural
but
the
other
hand
all
her
previous
thoughts
her
betrothed
princess
mary
life
the
country
did
not
once
recur
her
mind
and
were
belonging
remote
past
the
fourth
act
there
was
some
sort
devil
who
sang
waving
his
arm
about
till
the
boards
were
withdrawn
from
under
him
and
disappeared
down
below
that
was
the
only
part
the
fourth
act
that
natasha
saw
she
felt
agitated
and
tormented
and
the
cause
this
was
kuragin
whom
she
could
not
help
watching
they
were
leaving
the
theater
anatole
came
them
called
their
carriage
and
helped
them
was
putting
natasha
pressed
her
arm
above
the
elbow
agitated
and
flushed
she
turned
round
was
looking
her
with
glittering
eyes
smiling
tenderly
only
after
she
had
reached
home
was
natasha
able
clearly
think
over
what
had
happened
her
and
suddenly
remembering
prince
andrew
she
was
horrified
and
tea
which
all
had
sat
down
after
the
opera
she
gave
loud
exclamation
flushed
and
ran
out
the
room
god
lost
she
said
herself
how
could
let
him
she
sat
for
long
time
hiding
her
flushed
face
her
hands
trying
realize
what
had
happened
her
but
was
unable
either
understand
what
had
happened
what
she
felt
everything
seemed
dark
obscure
and
terrible
there
that
enormous
illuminated
theater
where
the
bare
legged
duport
tinsel
decorated
jacket
jumped
about
the
music
wet
boards
and
young
girls
and
old
men
and
the
nearly
naked
helene
with
her
proud
calm
smile
rapturously
cried
bravo
there
the
presence
that
helene
had
all
seemed
clear
and
simple
but
now
alone
herself
was
incomprehensible
what
what
was
that
terror
felt
him
what
this
gnawing
conscience
feeling
now
she
thought
only
the
old
countess
night
bed
could
natasha
have
told
all
she
was
feeling
she
knew
that
sonya
with
her
severe
and
simple
views
would
either
not
understand
all
would
horrified
such
confession
natasha
tried
solve
what
was
torturing
her
herself
spoiled
for
andrew
love
not
she
asked
herself
and
with
soothing
irony
replied
what
fool
ask
that
what
did
happen
nothing
have
done
nothing
didn
lead
him
all
nobody
will
know
and
shall
never
see
him
again
she
told
herself
plain
that
nothing
has
happened
and
there
nothing
repent
and
andrew
can
love
still
but
why
still
god
why
isn
here
natasha
quieted
herself
for
moment
but
again
some
instinct
told
her
that
though
all
this
was
true
and
though
nothing
had
happened
yet
the
former
purity
her
love
for
prince
andrew
had
perished
and
again
imagination
she
went
over
her
whole
conversation
with
kuragin
and
again
saw
the
face
gestures
and
tender
smile
that
bold
handsome
man
when
pressed
her
arm
chapter
anatole
kuragin
was
staying

from
the
time

chapter
xii
the
day
after
the
opera
the
rostovs
went
nowhere
and
nobody
came
see
them
marya
dmitrievna
talked
the
count
about
something
which
they
concealed
from
natasha
natasha
guessed
they
were
talking
about
the
old
prince
and
planning
something
and
this
disquieted
and
offended
her
she
was
expecting
prince
andrew
any
moment
and
twice
that
day
sent
manservant
the
vozdvizhenka
ascertain
whether
had
come
had
not
arrived
she
suffered
more
now
than
during
her
first
days
moscow
her
impatience
and
pining
for
him
were
now
added
the
unpleasant
recollection
her
interview
with
princess
mary
and
the
old
prince
and
fear
and
anxiety
which
she
did
not
understand
the
cause
she
continually
fancied
that
either
would
never
come
that
something
would
happen
her
before
came
she
could
longer
think
him
herself
calmly
and
continuously
she
had
done
before
soon
she
began
think
him
the
recollection
the
old
prince
princess
mary
the
theater
and
kuragin
mingled
with
her
thoughts
the
question
again
presented
itself
whether
she
was
not
guilty
whether
she
had
not
already
broken

herself
recalling
the

man
who
had
been
able

her
such
incomprehensible
and
terrifying
feeling
the

natasha
seemed
livelier

she
nodded
the
dressmaker
whom
she
knew
and
who
had
curtsied
respectfully
her
and
seated
herself
armchair
beside
the
looking
glass
draping
the
folds
her
velvet
dress
picturesquely
she
did
not
cease
chattering
good
naturedly
and
gaily
continually
praising
natasha
beauty
she
looked
natasha
dresses
and
praised
them
well
new
dress
her

made
metallic
gauze
which
she
had

felt
happy
and
she
were
blossoming
under
the
praise
this
dear
countess
bezukhova
who
had
formerly
seemed
her
unapproachable
and
important
and
was
now
kind
her
natasha
brightened
and
felt
almost
love
with
this
woman
who
was
beautiful
and
kind
helene
for
her
part
was
sincerely
delighted
with
natasha
and
wished
give
her
good
time
anatole
had
asked
her
bring
him
and
natasha
together
and
she
was
calling
the
rostovs
for
that
purpose
the
idea
throwing
her
brother
and
natasha
together
amused
her
though
one
time
petersburg
she
had
been
annoyed
with
natasha
for
drawing
boris
away
she
did
not
think
that
now
and
her
own
way
heartily
wished
natasha
well

was
leaving

scarlet
when
she
heard

how
she
blushes

pretty
said
helene
you

and
she
and
her
husband
pierre
that
good
pierre
have
talked
and
laughed
about
this
all
right
and
again
under
helene
influence
what
had
seemed
terrible
now
seemed
simple
and
natural
and
she
such
grande
dame
kind
and
evidently
likes
much
and
why
not
enjoy
myself
thought
natasha
gazing
helene
with
wide
open
wondering
eyes
marya
dmitrievna
came
back
dinner
taciturn
and
serious
having
evidently
suffered
defeat
the
old
prince
she
was
still
too
agitated
the
encounter
able
talk
the
affair
calmly
answer
the
count
inquiries
she
replied
that
things
were
all
right
and
that
she
would
tell

the
invitation

she
saw

was
seized
the

her
bare
fat
dimpled
arms
and
red

draped
over

into
the
space
left
vacant
for
her
and
assumed
unnatural
pose
enthusiastic
whispering
was
audible
mademoiselle
george
looked
sternly
and
gloomily
the
audience
and
began
reciting
some
french
verses
describing
her
guilty
love
for
her
son
some
places
she
raised
her
voice

she
whispered

sometimes
she
paused
and
uttered
hoarse

from
every
side
natasha
looked
the
fat
actress
but
neither
saw
nor
heard
nor
understood
anything
what
went
before
her
she
only
felt
herself
again
completely
borne
away
into
this
strange
senseless
world
remote
from
her
old
world
world
which
was
impossible
know
what
was
good
bad
reasonable
senseless
behind
her
sat
anatole
and
conscious
his
proximity
she
experienced
frightened
sense
expectancy
after
the
first
monologue
the
whole
company
rose
and
surrounded
mademoiselle
george
expressing
their
enthusiasm
how
beautiful
she
natasha
remarked
her
father
who
had
also
risen
and
was
moving
through
the
crowd
toward
the
actress

natasha
said
the
count
turned
back
for
his
daughter
how
beautiful
she
natasha
without
saying
anything
stepped
her
father
and
looked
him
with
surprised
inquiring
eyes
after
giving
several
recitations
mademoiselle
george
left
and
countess
bezukhova
asked
her
visitors
into
the
ballroom
the
count
wished
home
but
helene
entreated
him
not
spoil
her
improvised
ball
and
the
rostovs
stayed
anatole
asked
natasha
for
valse
and
they
danced
pressed
her
waist
and
hand
and
told
her
she
was
bewitching
and
that
loved
her
during
the
ecossaise
which
she
also
danced
with
him
anatole
said
nothing
when
they
happened
themselves
but
merely
gazed
her
natasha
lifted
her
frightened
eyes
him
but
there
was
such
confident
tenderness
his
affectionate
look
and
smile
that
she
could
not
whilst
looking
him
say
what
she
had
say
she
lowered
her
eyes
don
say
such
things
betrothed
and
love
another
she
said
rapidly
she
glanced

not
upset
pained
what
she
had
said

our
turn
begin
natasha
animated
and
excited
looked
about
her
with
wide
open
frightened
eyes
and
seemed
merrier
than
usual
she
understood
hardly
anything
that
went
that
evening
they
danced
the
ecossaise
and
the
grossvater
her
father
asked
her
come
home
but
she
begged
remain
wherever
she
went
and
whomever
she
was
speaking
she
felt
his
eyes
upon
her
later
she
recalled
how
she
had
asked
her
father
let
her
the
dressing
room
rearrange
her
dress
that
helene
had
followed
her
and
spoken
laughingly
her
brother
love
and
that
she
again
met
anatole
the
little
sitting
room
helene
had
disappeared
leaving
them
alone
and
anatole
had
taken
her
hand
and
said
tender
voice
cannot
come
visit
you
but
possible
that
shall
never
see
you
love
you
madly
can
never
and
blocking
her
path
brought
his
face
close
hers
his
large
glittering
masculine
eyes
were
close
hers
that
she
saw
nothing
but
them
natalie
whispered
inquiringly
while
she
felt
her
hands
being
painfully
pressed
natalie
don
understand
have
nothing
say
her
eyes
replied
burning
lips
were
pressed
hers
and
the
same
instant
she
felt
herself
released
and
helene
footsteps
and
the
rustle
her
dress
were
heard
the
room
natasha
looked
round
her
and
then
red
and
trembling
threw
frightened
look
inquiry
anatole
and
moved
toward
the
door
one
word
just
one
for
god
sake
cried
anatole
she
paused
she
wanted
word
from
him
that
would
explain
her
what
had
happened
and
which
she
could
find
answer
natalie
just
word
only
one
kept
repeating
evidently
not
knowing
what
say
and
repeated
till
helene
came
them
helene
returned
with
natasha
the
drawing
room
the
rostovs
went
away
without
staying
for
supper
after
reaching
home
natasha
did
not
sleep
all
night
she
was
tormented
the
insoluble
question
whether
she
loved
anatole
prince
andrew
she
loved
prince
andrew
she
remembered
distinctly
how
deeply
she
loved
him
but
she
also
loved
anatole
that
there
was
doubt
else
how
could
all
this
have
happened
thought
she
after
that
could
return
his
smile
when
saying
good
was
able
let
come
that
means
that
loved
him
from
the
first
means
that
kind
noble
and
splendid
and
could
not
help
loving
him
what
love
him
and
the
other
one
too
she
asked
herself
unable
find
answer
these
terrible
questions

sat
down

writing
table
answer

mechanically

she
write
after
all
that

the
evening
before
yes

all
that

natasha
went

and
again
took
princess

letter
can
that
all
over
she

that
all

quickly
and
has
destroyed
all
that
went
before
she
recalled
her
love
for
prince
andrew
all
its
former
strength
and
the
same
time
felt
that
she
loved
kuragin
she
vividly
pictured
herself
prince
andrew
wife
and
the
scenes
happiness
with
him
she
had
often
repeated
her
imagination
and
the
same
time
aglow
with
excitement
recalled
every
detail
yesterday
interview
with
anatole
why
could
that
not
well
she
sometimes
asked
herself
complete
bewilderment
only
could
completely
happy
but
now
have
choose
and
can
happy
without
either
them
only
she
thought
tell
prince
andrew
what
has
happened
hide
from
him
are
both
equally
impossible
but
with
that
one
nothing
spoiled
but
really
abandon
forever
the
joy

whispered
maid
entering
the
room
with
mysterious
air
man
told
give
you
this
and
she
handed
natasha
letter
only
for
christ
sake
the
girl
went
natasha
without
thinking
mechanically
broke
the
seal
and
read
love
letter
from
anatole
which
without
taking
word
she
understood
only
that
was
letter
from
him
from
the
man
she
loved
yes
she
loved
him
else
how
could
that
have
happened
which
had
happened
and
how
could
she
have
love
letter
from
him
her
hand
with
trembling
hands
natasha
held
that
passionate
love
letter
which
dolokhov
had
composed
for
anatole
and
she
read
she
found
echo
all
that
she
herself
imagined
she
was
feeling
since
yesterday
evening
fate
has
been
sealed
loved
you
die
there
other
way
for
the
letter
began
then

reveal
only
her
but
that
she
loved
him
she
need
only
say
the
word
yes
and
human
power
could
hinder
their
bliss

conquer
all

steal
her
away
and
carry
her
off
the
ends
the
earth
yes
yes

him
thought
natasha
reading
the
letter
for
the
twentieth
time
and
finding
some
peculiarly
deep
meaning
each
word
that
evening
marya
dmitrievna

proposed
take
the

keep
herself
from

sonya
pale

and
agitation
sat
down

burst
into

nothing
how

thought
sonya
but
can
that
she
loves
him
she
probably
opened
the
letter
without
knowing
who

offended
she

not
such
thing
sonya
wiped
away
her
tears
and
went

scanning
her
face
natasha

without

reflection
wrote

she
had
been

that
all
through

she
was
more
agitated
than
ever
when
they
got

everybody
but
what
sonya
did
not
succumb
the
tender
tone
natasha
used
toward
her
the
more
emotional
and
ingratiating
the
expression
natasha
face
became
the
more
serious
and
stern
grew
sonya
natasha
said
she
you
asked

and
haven
spoken
but
now
you
yourself
have
begun

natasha
why
this

again
again
interrupted
natasha
natasha
afraid
for

said
sonya
resolutely
and
was

and
natasha
ran
out
the
room
natasha
did
not
speak
sonya
again
and
avoided
her
with
the
same
expression
agitated
surprise
and
guilt
she
went
about
the
house
taking
now
one
occupation
now
another
and
once
abandoning
them
hard
was
for
sonya
she
watched
her
friend
and
did
not
let
her
out
her
sight
the
day
before
the

that
she
made

who
drove
past
whom
sonya
took
anatole
sonya
began
watching
her
friend
still
more
attentively
and
noticed
that
dinner
and
all
that
evening
natasha
was
strange
and
unnatural
state
she
answered
questions
random
began
sentences
she
did
not

and
laughed
everything
after

sonya
noticed
housemaid

timidly
waiting
let
her
pass
she
let
the
girl
and
then
listening
the
door
learned
that
another
letter

suddenly
became
clear
sonya
that

had
some
dreadful
plan
for
that
evening

knocked
her
door
natasha
did
not
let
her

some
time
enjoining
her
that

assuring
her
that
nobody
would
know
anything
about

natasha
herself
would
undertake
forget
all
and
not
let
anyone
see
that
something
had
happened
natasha
did
not
reply
nor
did
she
sob
any
longer
but
she
grew
cold
and
had
shivering
fit
marya
dmitrievna
put
pillow
under
her
head
covered
her
with
two
quilts
and
herself
brought
her
some
lime
flower
water
but
natasha
did
not
respond
her
well
let
her
sleep
said
marya
dmitrievna

went
out

natasha
was
not
asleep

him
and
told
him
that
natasha
had
been
very
unwell
the
day
before
and
that
they
had
sent
for
the
doctor
but
that
she
was
better
now
natasha
had
not
left
her
room
that
morning
with
compressed
and
parched
lips
and
dry
fixed
eyes
she
sat
the
window
uneasily
watching
the
people
who
drove
past
and
hurriedly
glancing
round
anyone
who
entered
the
room
she
was
evidently
expecting
news
him
and
that

come

assured
him
that
nothing

and
asked
him
not

marya

from
the

sonya
and
marya
dmitrievna
the

saw
clearly
that
something
had
gone
wrong
during
his
absence
but
was
terrible
for
him
think
that
anything
disgraceful
had
happened
his
beloved
daughter
and
prized
his
own
cheerful
tranquillity
that
avoided
inquiries
and
tried
assure
himself
that
nothing
particularly
had
happened
and
was
only
dissatisfied

glanced
round
him
frowned
and
left
the
room
with
expression
cold
dignity
what
has
happened
asked
pierre
entering
marya
dmitrievna
room
fine
doings
answered
dmitrievna
for
fifty
eight
years
have
lived
this
world
and
never
known
anything
disgraceful
and
having
put
him
his
honor
not
repeat
anything
she
told
him
marya
dmitrievna
informed
him
that
natasha
had
refused
prince
andrew
without
her
parents
knowledge
and
that
the
cause
this
was
anatole
kuragin
into
whose
society
pierre
wife
had
thrown
her
and
with
whom
natasha
had
tried
elope
during
her
father
absence
order
married
secretly
pierre
raised
his
shoulders
and
listened
open
mouthed
what
was
told
him
scarcely
able
believe
his
own
ears
that
prince
andrew
deeply
loved
affianced
wife
the
same
natasha
rostova
who
used
charming
should
give
bolkonski
for
that
fool
anatole
who
was
already
secretly
married
pierre
knew
and
should
love
with
him
agree
run
away
with
him
was
something
pierre
could
not
conceive
and
could
not
imagine
could
not
reconcile
the
charming
impression
had
natasha
whom
had
known
from
child
with
this
new
conception
her
baseness
folly
and
cruelty
thought
his
wife
they
are
all
alike
said
himself
reflecting
that
was
not
the
only
man
unfortunate
enough
tied
bad
woman
but
still
pitied
prince
andrew
the
point
tears
and
sympathized
with
his
wounded
pride
and
the
more
pitied
his
friend
the
more
did
think
with
contempt
and
even
with
disgust
that
natasha
who
had
just
passed
him
the
ballroom
with
such
look
cold
dignity
did
not
know
that
natasha
soul
was
overflowing
with
despair
shame
and
humiliation
and
that
was
not
her
fault
that
her
face
happened
assume
expression
calm
dignity
and
severity
but
how
get
married
said
pierre
answer
marya
dmitrievna
could
not
marry
married
things
get
worse
from
hour
hour
ejaculated
marya
dmitrievna
nice
youth
what
scoundrel
and
she
expecting
him
expecting
him
since
yesterday
she
must
told
then
least
she
won
expecting
him
after
hearing
the
details
anatole
marriage
from
pierre
and
giving
vent
her
anger
against
anatole
words
abuse
marya
dmitrievna
told
pierre
why
she
had
sent
for
him
she
was
afraid
that
the
count
bolkonski
who
might
arrive
any
moment
they
knew
this
affair
which
she
hoped
hide
from
them
might
challenge
anatole
duel
and
she
therefore
asked
pierre
tell
his
brother
law
her
name
leave
moscow
and
not
dare
let
her
set
eyes
him
again
pierre
only
now
realizing
the
danger
the
old
count
nicholas
and
prince
andrew
promised
she
wished
having
briefly
and
exactly
explained
her
wishes
him
she
let
him
the
drawing
room
mind
the
count
knows
nothing
behave

know
nothing
either
she
said
and
will
and
tell
her
use
expecting
him
and
stay

you
care
she
called
after
pierre
pierre
met
the
old
count
who
seemed
nervous
and
upset
that
morning
natasha
had
told
him
that
she
had
rejected
bolkonski
troubles

pierre

frank

broken
off
her
engagement
without
consulting
anybody
true
this
engagement
never
was
much
liking
course
excellent
man
but
still
with
his
father
disapproval
they
wouldn
have
been
happy
and
natasha
won
lack
suitors
still
has
been
going
long
and
take
such
step
without
father
mother
consent
and
now
she
ill
and
god

hard
count

manage
daughters
their
mother
absence
pierre
saw
that
the
count
was
much
upset
and
tried
change
the
subject
but
the
count
returned
his
troubles
sonya
entered
the
room
with
agitated
face
natasha
not
quite
well
she
her
room
and
would
like
see
you
marya
dmitrievna
with
her
and
she
too
asks

great
friend
bolkonski
doubt
she
wants
send
him
message
said
the
count
dear
dear
how
happy
all
was
and
clutching
the
spare
gray
locks
his
temples
the
count
left
the
room
when
marya
dmitrievna
told
natasha
that
anatole
was
married
natasha
did
not
wish
believe
and
insisted
having
confirmed
pierre
himself
sonya
told
pierre
this
she
led
him
along
the
corridor
natasha
room
natasha
pale
and
stern
was
sitting
beside
marya
dmitrievna
and
her
eyes
glittering
feverishly
met
pierre
with
questioning
look
the
moment
entered
she
did
not
smile
nod
but
only
gazed
fixedly
him
and
her
look
asked
only
one
thing
was
friend
like
the
others
enemy
regard
anatole
for
pierre
evidently
did
not
exist
for
her

all
about
said
marya
dmitrievna
pointing
pierre
and
addressing
natasha
let
him
tell
you
whether

told
the
truth
natasha
looked
from
one
the
other
hunted
and
wounded
animal
looks
the
approaching
dogs
and
sportsmen
natalya
ilynichna
pierre
began
dropping
his
eyes
with
feeling
pity
for
her
and
loathing
for
the
thing
had
whether
true
not
should
make
difference
you
because
then
not
true
that
married
yes
true
has
been
married
long
she
asked
your
honor
pierre
gave
his
word
honor
still
here
she
asked
quickly
yes
have
just
seen
him
she
was
evidently
unable
speak
and
made
sign
with
her
hands
that
they
should
leave
her
alone
chapter
pierre
did
not
stay
for
dinner
but
left
the
room
and
went
away
once
drove
through
the
town
seeking
anatole
kuragin
the
thought
whom
now
the
blood
rushed
his
heart
and
felt
difficulty
breathing
was
not
the
ice
hills
nor
the
gypsies
nor
komoneno
pierre
drove
the
club
the
club
all
was
going
usual
the
members
who
were
assembling
for
dinner
were
sitting
about
groups
they
greeted
pierre
and
spoke
the
town
news
the
footman
having
greeted
him
knowing
his
habits
and
his
acquaintances
told
him
there
was
place
left
for
him

small
dining
room
and
that
prince
michael
zakharych
was

heard
kuragin
abduction
rostova
which
was
talked

and
was
true
pierre
laughed
and
said

nonsense
for
had
just
come
from
the
rostovs
asked
everyone
about
anatole
one
man
told
him
had
not
come
yet
and
another
that

pierre
felt
strange
see
this
calm
indifferent
crowd
people
unaware
what
was
going
his
soul
paced
through
the
ballroom
waited
till
everyone
had
come
and
anatole
had
not
turned
did
not
stay
for
dinner
but
drove
home
anatole
for
whom
pierre
was
looking
dined
that
day
with
dolokhov
consulting
him
how
remedy
this
unfortunate
affair
seemed
him
essential
see
natasha
the
evening
drove
his
sister
discuss
with
her
how
arrange
meeting
when
pierre
returned
home
after
vainly
hunting
all
over
moscow
his
valet
informed
him
that
prince
anatole
was
with
the
countess
the
countess
drawing
room
was
full
guests
pierre
without
greeting
his
wife
whom
had
not
seen
since
his
return
that
moment
she
was
more
repulsive
him
than
ever
entered
the
drawing
room
and
seeing
anatole
went
him
pierre
said
the
countess
going
her
husband
you
don
know
what
plight
our
anatole
she
stopped
seeing
the
forward
thrust
her
husband
head
his
glowing
eyes
and
his
resolute
gait
the
terrible
indications
that
rage
and
strength
which
she
knew
and
had
herself
experienced
after
his
duel
with
dolokhov
where
you
are
there
vice
and
evil
said
pierre
his
wife
anatole
come
with
must
speak
you
added
french
anatole
glanced
round
his
sister
and
rose
submissively
ready
follow
pierre
pierre
taking
him
the
arm
pulled
him
toward
himself
and
was
leading
him
from
the
room
you
allow
yourself
drawing
room
whispered
helene
but
pierre
did
not
reply
and
went
out
the
room
anatole
followed
him
with
his
usual
jaunty
step
but
his
face
betrayed
anxiety
having
entered
his
study
pierre
closed
the
door
and
addressed
anatole
without
looking
him
you
promised
countess
rostova
marry
her
and
were
about
elope
with
her
that
mon
cher
answered
anatole
their
whole
conversation
was
french
don
consider
myself
bound
answer
questions
put
that
tone
pierre
face
already
pale
became
distorted
fury
seized
anatole
the
collar
his
uniform
with
his
big
hand
and
shook
him
from
side
side
till
anatole
face
showed
sufficient
degree
terror
when
tell
you
that
must
talk
you
repeated
pierre
come
now
this
stupid
what
said
anatole
fingering
button
his
collar
that
had
been
wrenched
loose
with
bit
the
cloth
you
scoundrel
and
blackguard
and
don
know
what
deprives
from
the
pleasure
smashing
your
head
with
this
said
pierre
expressing
himself
artificially
because
was
talking
french
took
heavy
paperweight
and
lifted
threateningly
but
once
put
back
its
place
did
you
promise
marry
her
didn
think
never
promised
because
pierre
interrupted
him
have
you
any
letters
hers
any
letters
said
moving
toward
anatole
anatole
glanced
him
and
immediately
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
drew
out
his
pocketbook
pierre
took
the
letter
anatole
handed
him
and
pushing
aside
table
that
stood
his
way
threw
himself
the
sofa
shan
violent
don
afraid
said
pierre
answer
frightened
gesture
anatole
first
the
letters
said
repeating
lesson
himself
secondly
continued
after
short
pause
again
rising
and
again
pacing
the
room
tomorrow
you
must
get
out
moscow
but
how
can
thirdly
pierre
continued
without
listening
him
you
must
never
breathe
word
what
has
passed
between
you
and
countess
rostova
know
can
prevent
your
doing
but
you
have
spark
conscience
pierre
paced
the
room
several
times
silence
anatole
sat
table
frowning
and
biting
his
lips
after
all
you
must
understand
that
besides
your
pleasure
there
such
thing
other
people
happiness
and
peace
and
that
you
are
ruining
whole
life
for
the
sake
amusing
yourself
amuse
yourself
with
women
like

with
them
you
are
within
your
rights
for

pierre
paused
and
looked
anatole
longer
with
angry
but
with
questioning
look
don
know
about
that
said
anatole
growing
more
confident
pierre
mastered
his
wrath
don
know
that
and
don
want
said
not
looking
pierre
and
with
slight
tremor
his
lower
jaw
but
you
have
used
such
words
mean
and
which
man
honor
can
allow
anyone
use
pierre
glanced
him
with
amazement
unable
understand
what
wanted
though
was
tête
tête
anatole
continued
still
can
satisfaction

said
pierre
ironically
you
could
least
take
back
your
words
what
you
want

wish
take
them
back
take
them
back
said
pierre
and
ask
you
forgive
pierre
involuntarily
glanced
the
loose
button
and
you
require
money
for
your
journey
anatole
smiled
the
expression
that
base
and
cringing
smile
which
pierre
knew
well
his
wife
revolted
him
vile
and
heartless
brood
exclaimed
and
left
the
room

resolutely
denied
these
rumors
assuring
everyone
that
nothing
had
happened
except
that
his
brother

proposed

and
been
refused

pierre
that
was
his
duty

the
whole

and
establish

and

and
awaited
his

with
great
impatience
some
days
after

pierre
received

from

informing

asking

evening
and
pierre
came
see
him
next
morning
pierre
expected

almost
the
same
state
natasha
and
was
therefore
surprised
entering
the
drawing
room
hear
him
the
study
talking
loud
animated
voice
about
some
intrigue
going
petersburg
the
old
prince
voice
and
another
now
and
then
interrupted
him
princess
mary
came
out
meet
pierre
she
sighed
looking
toward
the
door
the
room
where
prince
andrew
was
evidently
intending
express
her
sympathy
with
his
sorrow
but
pierre
saw
her
face
that
she
was
glad
both
what
had
happened
and
the
way
her
brother
had
taken
the
news
natasha
faithlessness
says
expected
she
remarked
know
his
pride
will
not
let
him
express
his
feelings
but
still
has
taken
better
far
better
than
expected
evidently
had
but
possible
that
all
really
ended
asked
pierre
princess
mary
looked
him
with
astonishment
she
did
not
understand
how
could
ask
such
question
pierre
went
into
the
study
prince
andrew
greatly
changed
and
plainly
better
health
but
with
fresh
horizontal
wrinkle
between
his
brows
stood
civilian
dress
facing
his
father
and
prince
meshcherski
warmly
disputing
and
vigorously
gesticulating
the
conversation
was
about
speranski
the
news
whose
sudden
exile
and
alleged
treachery
had
just
reached
moscow
now
censured
and
accused
all
who
were
enthusiastic
about
him
month
ago
prince
andrew
was
saying
and
those
who
were
unable
understand
his
aims
judge
man
who
disfavor
and
throw
him
all
the
blame
other
men
mistakes
very
easy
but
maintain
that
anything
good
has
been
accomplished
this
reign
was
done
him
him
alone
paused
the
sight
pierre
his
face
quivered
and
immediately
assumed
vindictive
expression
posterity
will
him
justice
concluded
and
once
turned
pierre
well
how
are
you
still
getting
stouter
said
with
animation
but
the
new
wrinkle
his
forehead
deepened
yes
well
said
answer
pierre
question
and
smiled
pierre
that
smile
said
plainly
well
but
health
now
use
anyone
after
few
words
pierre
about
the
awful
roads
from
the
polish
frontier
about
people
had
met
switzerland
who
knew
pierre
and
about
dessalles
whom
had
brought
from
abroad
his
son
tutor
prince
andrew
again
joined
warmly
the
conversation
about
speranski
which
was
still
going
between
the
two
old
men
there
were
treason
proofs
secret
relations
with
napoleon
they
would
have
been
made
public
said
with
warmth
and
haste
not
and
never
did
like
speranski
personally
but
like
justice
pierre
now
recognized
his
friend
need
with
which
was
only
too
familiar
get
excited
and
have
arguments
about
extraneous
matters
order
stifle
thoughts
that
were
too
oppressive
and
too
intimate
when
prince
meshcherski
had
left
prince
andrew
took
pierre
arm
and
asked
him
into
the
room
that
had
been
assigned
him
bed
had
been
made
there
and
some
open
portmanteaus
and
trunks
stood
about
prince
andrew
went
one
and
took
out
small
casket
from
which
drew
packet
wrapped
paper
did
all
silently
and
very
quickly
stood
and
coughed
his
face
was
gloomy
and
his
lips
compressed
forgive
for
troubling
you
pierre
saw
that
prince
andrew
was
going
speak
natasha
and
his
broad
face
expressed
pity
and
sympathy
this
expression
irritated
prince
andrew
and
determined
ringing
and
unpleasant
tone
continued
have
received
refusal
from
countess
rostova
and
have
heard
reports
your
brother
law
having
sought
her
hand
something
that
kind
that
true
both
true
and
untrue
pierre
began
but
prince
andrew
interrupted
him
here
are
her
letters
and
her
portrait
said
took
the
packet
from
the
table
and
handed
pierre
give
this
the
countess

her
she
very
ill
said
pierre
then
she
here

coldly
maliciously
and
unpleasantly
monsieur

has
not

said
prince
andrew
and
snorted

times

laughed
disagreeably

reminding

pierre
took
the
packet
prince
andrew
trying
remember
whether
had
something
more
say
waiting
see
pierre
would
say
anything
looked
fixedly
him
say

our
discussion

about

said
pierre
prince

interrupted
him
and
cried
sharply
yes

magnanimous
and
yes

noble

unable

pierre
left
the
room
and
went
the
old
prince
and
princess
mary
the
old
man
seemed
livelier
than
usual
princess
mary
was
the
same
always
but
beneath
her
sympathy
for
her
brother
pierre
noticed
her
satisfaction
that
the
engagement
had
been
broken
off
looking
them
pierre
realized
what
contempt
and
animosity
they
all
felt
for
the
rostovs
and
that
was
impossible
their
presence
even
mention
the
name
her
who
could
give
prince
andrew
for
anyone
else
dinner
the
talk
turned
the
war
the
approach
which
was
becoming
evident
prince
andrew
talked
incessantly
arguing
now
with
his
father
now
with
the
swiss
tutor
dessalles
and
showing
unnatural
animation
the
cause
which
pierre
well
understood
chapter
xxii
that
same
evening
pierre
went
the
rostovs
fulfill
the
commission
entrusted
him
natasha
was
bed
the
count
the
club
and
pierre
after
giving
the
letters
sonya
went
marya
dmitrievna
who
was
interested
know
how
prince
andrew
had
taken
the
news
ten
minutes
later
sonya
came

she
but
how

into
the
drawing

sonya

only
shrugged
her
shoulders
when
will
her

has
worried

everything
said
she
pierre
one

she
much
pitied
much
pitied
natasha
was
standing
the
middle
the
drawing
room
emaciated
with
pale
set
face
but
not
all
shamefaced
pierre
expected
find
her
when
appeared
the
door
she
grew
flurried
evidently
undecided
whether
meet
him
wait
till
came
pierre
hastened
her
thought
she
would
give
him
her
hand
usual
but
she
stepping
him
stopped
breathing
heavily
her
arms
hanging
lifelessly
just
the
pose
she
used
stand
when
she
went
the
middle
the
ballroom
sing
but
with
quite
different
expression
face
peter
kirilovich
she
began
rapidly
prince
bolkonski
was
your
friend
your
friend
she
corrected
herself
seemed
her
that
everything
that
had
once
been
must
now
different
told
once
apply
you
pierre
sniffed
looked
her
but
did
not
speak
till
then
had
reproached
her
his
heart
and
tried
despise
her
but
now
felt
sorry
for
her
that
there
was
room
his
soul
for
reproach
here
now
tell
him
for
forgive
she
stopped
and
breathed
still
more
quickly
but
did
not
shed
tears
yes
will
tell
him
answered
pierre
but
did
not
know
what
say
natasha
was
evidently
dismayed
the
thought
what
might
think
she
had
meant
know
all
over
she
said
hurriedly
that
can
never
only
tormented
the
wrong
have
done
him
tell
him
only
that
beg
him
forgive
forgive
forgive
for
everything
she
trembled
all
over
and
sat
down
chair
sense
pity
had
never
before
known
overflowed
pierre
heart
will
tell
him
will
tell
him
everything
once
more
said
pierre
but
should
like
know
one
thing
know
what
natasha
eyes
asked
should
like
know
did
you
love
pierre
did
not
know
how
refer
anatole
and
flushed
the
thought
him
did
you
love
that
bad
man
don
call
him
bad
said
natasha
but
don
know
don
know
all
she
began
cry
and
still
greater
sense
pity
tenderness
and
love
welled
pierre
felt
the
tears
trickle
under
his
spectacles
and
hoped
they
would
not
noticed
won
speak
any
more
dear
said
pierre
and
his
gentle
cordial
tone
suddenly
seemed
very
strange
natasha
won
speak
dear
tell
him
everything
but
one
thing
beg
you
consider
your
friend
and
you
want
help
advice
simply
open
your
heart
someone
not
now
but
when
your
mind
clearer
think
took
her
hand
and
kissed
shall
happy
power
pierre
grew
confused
don
speak
like
that
not
worth
exclaimed
natasha
and
turned
leave
the
room
but
pierre
held
her
hand
knew
had
something
more
say
her
but
when
said
was
amazed
his
own
words
stop
stop
you
have
your
whole
life
before
you
said
her
before
all
over
for
she
replied
with
shame
and
self
abasement
all
over
repeated
were
not
myself
but
the
handsomest
cleverest
and
best
man
the
world
and
were
free
would
this
moment
ask
knees
for
your
hand
and
your
love
for
the
first
time
for
many
days
natasha
wept
tears
gratitude
and
tenderness
and
glancing
pierre
she
went
out
the
room
pierre
too
when
she
had
gone
almost
ran
into
the
anteroom
restraining
tears
tenderness
and
joy
that
choked
him
and
without
finding
the
sleeves
his
fur
cloak
threw
and
got
into
his
sleigh
where
now
your
excellency
asked
the
coachman
where
pierre
asked
himself
where
can
now
surely
not
the
club
pay
calls
all
men
seemed
pitiful
poor
comparison
with
this
feeling
tenderness
and
love
experienced
comparison
with
that
softened
grateful
last
look
she
had
given
him
through
her
tears
home
said
pierre
and
despite
twenty
two
degrees
frost
fahrenheit
threw
open
the
bearskin
cloak
from
his
broad
chest
and
inhaled
the
air
with
joy
was
clear
and
frosty
above
the
dirty
ill
lit
streets
above
the
black
roofs
stretched
the
dark
starry
sky
only
looking
the
sky
did
pierre
cease
feel
how
sordid
and
humiliating
were
all
mundane
things
compared
with
the
heights
which
his
soul
had
just
been
raised
the
entrance
the
arbat
square
immense
expanse
dark
starry
sky
presented
itself
his
eyes
almost
the
center
above
the
prechistenka
boulevard
surrounded
and
sprinkled
all
sides
stars
but
distinguished
from
them
all
its
nearness
the
earth
its
white
light
and
its
long
uplifted
tail
shone
the
enormous
and
brilliant
comet
the
comet
which
was
said
portend
all
kinds
woes
and
the
end
the
world
pierre
however
that
comet
with
its
long
luminous
tail
aroused
feeling
fear
the
contrary
gazed
joyfully
his
eyes
moist
with
tears
this
bright
comet
which
having
traveled
its
orbit
with
inconceivable
velocity
through
immeasurable
space
seemed
suddenly
like
arrow
piercing
the
earth
remain
fixed
chosen
spot
vigorously
holding
its
tail
erect
shining
and
displaying
its
white
light
amid
countless
other
scintillating
stars
seemed
pierre
that
this
comet
fully
responded
what
was
passing

own
softened
and
uplifted

what
produced

what

tell
with

were
the

inflicted
the

the

the

the

and
there

can
understand
that
the
matter
seemed
like
that
contemporaries
naturally
seemed
napoleon
that
the
war
was
caused
england
intrigues
fact
said
the
island
helena
naturally
seemed
members
the
english
parliament
that
the
cause
the
war
was
napoleon
ambition
the
duke
oldenburg
that
the
cause
the
war
was
the
violence
done
him
businessmen
that
the
cause
the
war
was
the
continental
system
which
was
ruining
europe
the
generals
and
old
soldiers
that
the
chief
reason
for
the
war
was
the
necessity
giving
them
employment
the
legitimists
that
day
that
was
the
need
establishing
les
bons
principes
and
the
diplomatists
that
time
that
all
resulted
from
the
fact
that
the
alliance
between
russia
and
austria
had
not
been
sufficiently
well
concealed
from
napoleon
and
from
the
awkward
wording
memorandum
natural
that
these
and
countless
and
infinite
quantity
other
reasons
the
number
depending
the
endless
diversity
points

presented
themselves
the
men
that
day
but
posterity
who
view
the
thing
that
happened
all
its
magnitude
and
perceive
its
plain
and
terrible
meaning
these
causes
seem
insufficient
incomprehensible
that
millions
christian
men
killed
and
tortured
each
other
either
because
napoleon
was
ambitious
alexander
was
firm
because
england
policy
was
astute
the
duke
oldenburg
wronged
cannot
grasp
what
connection
such
circumstances
have
with
the
actual
fact
slaughter
and
violence
why
because
the
duke
was
wronged
thousands
men
from
the
other
side
europe
killed
and
ruined
the

and
moscow
and

therefore

with
unclouded

these

the
more

each

whole

appears
equally
valid
itself
and
equally
false

and
its
impotence
apart
from
the

all
the
other
coincident
causes

the

the
wish
objection
this
that
french
corporal

appears
much
cause
napoleon
refusal
withdraw
his
troops
beyond
the
vistula
and
restore
the
duchy
oldenburg
for
had
not
wished
serve
and
had
second
third
and

corporal
and
private
also
refused
there
would
have
been
many
less
men
napoleon

and
the
war
could
not
have
occurred
had
napoleon
not
taken
offense
the
demand
that
should
withdraw
beyond
the
vistula
and
not
ordered
his
troops
advance
there
would
have
been
war
but
had
all
his
sergeants
objected
serving
second
term
then
also
there
could
have
been
war
nor
could
there
have
been
war
had
there
been
english
intrigues
and
duke
oldenburg
and
had
alexander
not
felt
insulted
and
had
there
not
been
autocratic
government
russia
revolution
france
and
subsequent
dictatorship
and
empire
all
the
things
that
produced
the
french

and
without
each
these
causes
nothing
could
have
happened
all
these
causes
myriads
causes

bring
about
and
there
was
one
cause
for
that
occurrence
but
had
occur
because
had
millions
men
renouncing
their
human

had
from

just
some

without

acclamations
which
evidently
endured
only
because
was
impossible

the

him
such
shouting
but
the
shouting
which
accompanied

asked
the

soon
the

had
said
this
the
old
mustached
officer
with
happy
face
and
sparkling
eyes
raised
his
saber
shouted
vivat
and
commanding
the
uhlans
follow
him
spurred
his
horse
and
galloped
into
the
river
gave
angry
thrust
his
horse
which
had
grown
restive
under
him
and
plunged
into
the
water
heading
for
the
deepest
part
where
the
current
was
swift
hundreds
uhlans
galloped
after
him
was
cold
and
uncanny
the

the

and
the
uhlans
caught

one
another
they
fell
off
their
horses
some
the

were

they
tried

though
there
was

away
were
proud
that
they
were
swimming
and
drowning
this
river
under

the
man
who
sat
the

and
was
not
even
looking
what
they
were
doing

ventured

the

person
the
little
man
the
gray
overcoat
got
and
having
summoned
berthier
began
pacing
and
down
the
bank
with
him
giving
him
instructions
and
occasionally
glancing
disapprovingly
the
drowning
uhlans
who
distracted
his
attention
for
him
was
new
conviction
that

alike
was

for

and
rode
his
quarters
some
forty
uhlans
were
drowned
the

though
boats
were
sent
their
assistance
the
majority
struggled
back
the
bank
from
which
they
had
started
the
colonel
and
some
his
men
got
across
and
with
difficulty
clambered
out
the
further
bank
and
soon
they
had
got
out
their
soaked
and
streaming
clothes
they
shouted
vivat
and
looked
ecstatically
the
spot
where
napoleon
had
been
but
where
longer
was
and
that
moment
considered
themselves
happy
that
evening
between

each
the
three

had
its

but
there
was
supreme

the

did
not
assume
that
responsibility

the
less
did
everybody
tired
waiting
prepare
for
the

all
the

also
there
and
though
not

had
subscribed
large
sum
toward
the
expenses
boris
was
now
rich
man
who
had
risen
high
honors
and
longer
sought
patronage
but
stood
equal
footing
with
the
highest
those
his
own
age
was
meeting
helene
vilna
after
not
having
seen
her
for
long
time
and
did
not
recall
the
past
but
helene
was
enjoying
the
favors
very
important
personage
and
boris
had
only
recently
married
they
met
good
friends
long
standing
midnight

still
going

not
having

offered
dance
the
mazurka
with
boris
they
were
the
third
couple
boris
coolly
looking
helene
dazzling
bare
shoulders
which
emerged
from
dark
gold
embroidered
gauze
gown
talked
her
old
acquaintances
and
the
same
time
unaware
himself
and
unnoticed
others
never
for
instant
ceased
observe
the
emperor
who
was
the
same
room
the
emperor
was
not
dancing
stood
the
doorway
stopping
now
one
pair
and
now
another
with
gracious
words
which
alone
knew
how
utter
the
mazurka
began
boris
saw
that
adjutant
general
balashev
one
those
closest

the
emperor
went
him
and
contrary
court
etiquette
stood
near
him
while
was
talking
polish
lady
having
finished
speaking
her
the
emperor
looked
inquiringly
balashev
and
evidently
understanding
that
only
acted
thus
because
there
were
important
reasons
for
doing
nodded
slightly
the
lady
and
turned
him
hardly
had
balashev
begun
speak
before
look
amazement
appeared
the
emperor
face
took
balashev
the
arm
and
crossed
the
room
with
him
unconsciously
clearing
path
seven
yards
wide
the
people
both
sides
made
way
for
him
boris
noticed
arakcheev
excited
face
when
the
sovereign
went
out
with
balashev
arakcheev
looked
the
emperor
from
under
his
brow
and
sniffing
with
his
red
nose
stepped
forward
from
the
crowd
expecting
the
emperor
address
him
boris
understood
that
arakcheev
envied
balashev
and
was
displeased
that
evidently
important
news
had
reached
the
emperor
otherwise
than
through
himself
but
the
emperor
and
balashev
passed
out
into
the
illuminated
garden
without
noticing
arakcheev
who
holding
his
sword
and
glancing
wrathfully
around
followed
some
twenty
paces
behind
them
all
the
time
boris
was
going
through
the
figures
the
mazurka
was
worried
the
question
what
news
balashev
had
brought
and
how
could
find
out
before
others
the
figure
which
had
choose
two
ladies
whispered
helene
that
meant
choose
countess
potocka
who
thought
had
gone
out
onto
the
veranda
and
glided
over
the
parquet
the
door
opening
into
the
garden
where
seeing
balashev
and
the
emperor
returning
the
veranda
stood
still
they
were
moving
toward
the
door
boris
fluttering
had
not
had
time
withdraw
respectfully
pressed
close
the
doorpost
with
bowed
head
the
emperor
with
the
agitation
one
who
has
been

affronted
was
finishing
with
these

declaring

not

seemed
boris
that
gave
the
emperor
pleasure
utter
these
words
was
satisfied
with
the
form
which
had
expressed
his
thoughts
but
displeased
that
boris
had
overheard
let
one
know
the
emperor
added
with
frown
boris
understood
that
this
was
meant
for
him
and
closing
his
eyes
slightly
bowed
his
head
the
emperor
entered
the
ballroom
and
remained
there

another
half
hour

time
french
colonel
hussars
who
had
evidently
just
left
his
bed
came
riding
from
the
village
handsome
sleek
gray
horse
accompanied
two
hussars
the
officer
the
soldiers
and
their
horses
all
looked
smart
and
well
kept
was
that
first
period
campaign
when
troops
are
still
full
trim
almost
like
that
peacetime
maneuvers
but
with
shade
martial
swagger
their
clothes
and
touch
the
gaiety
and
spirit
enterprise
which
always
accompany
the
opening
campaign
the
french
colonel
with
difficulty
repressed
yawn
but
was
polite
and
evidently
understood
balashev
importance
led
him
past
his
soldiers
and
behind
the
outposts
and
told
him
that
his
wish
presented
the
emperor
would
most
likely
satisfied
immediately
the
emperor
quarters
were
believed
not
far
off
they
rode
through
the
village
rykonty
past
tethered
french
hussar
horses
past
sentinels
and
men
who
saluted
their
colonel
and
stared
with
curiosity
russian
uniform
and
came
out
the
other
end
the
village
the
colonel
said
that
the
commander
the
division
was
mile
and
quarter
away
and
would
receive
balashev
and
conduct
him
his
destination
the
sun
had
now
risen
and
shone
gaily
the
bright
verdure
they
had
hardly
ridden
hill
past
tavern
before
they
saw
group
horsemen
coming
toward
them
front
the
group
black
horse
with
trappings
that
glittered
the
sun
rode
tall
man
with
plumes
his
hat
and
black
hair
curling
down
his
shoulders
wore
red
mantle
and
stretched
his
long
legs
forward
french
fashion
this
man
rode
toward
balashev
gallop
his
plumes
flowing
and
his
gems
and
gold
lace
glittering
the
bright
june

balashev
was
only
two
horses
length
from
the
equestrian
with
the
bracelets
plumes
necklaces
and
gold
embroidery
who
was
galloping
toward
him
with
theatrically
solemn
countenance
when
julner
the
french
colonel
whispered
respectfully
the
king
naples
was
fact
murat
now
called
king
naples
though
was
quite
incomprehensible
why
should
king
naples
was
called
and
was
himself
convinced
that
was
and
therefore
assumed
more
solemn
and
important
air
than
formerly
was
sure
that
really
was
the
king
naples
that
when
the
eve
his
departure
from
that
city
while
walking
through
the
streets
with
his
wife
some
italians
called
out
him
viva
turned
his
wife
with
pensive
smile
and
said
poor
fellows
they
don
know
that
leaving
them
tomorrow
long
live
the
king
but
though
firmly
believed
himself
king
naples
and
pitied
the
grief
felt
the
subjects
was
abandoning
latterly
after
had
been
ordered
return
military
service
and
especially
since
his
last
interview
with
napoleon
danzig
when
his
august
brother
law
had
told
him
made
you
king
that
you
should

gaily
and
contentedly
galloped
along

without
himself
knowing
why
whither
seeing
the
russian

threw
back
his

with
its
long

and
looked
inquiringly

respectfully
informed
his

your

general
added
with
gesture
kingly
condescension
soon
the
king
began
speak
loud
and
fast
his
royal
dignity
instantly
forsook
him
and
without
noticing
passed
into
his
natural
tone
good
natured
familiarity
laid
his
hand
the
withers
balashev

and
said
well

all
looks
like

which
was
unable

your

replied
balashev
master
the
emperor
does
not
desire
war
and
your
majesty
sees
said
balashev
using
the
words
your
majesty
every
opportunity
with
the
affectation
unavoidable
frequently
addressing
one
whom
the
title
was
still
novelty

felt

dismounted
took
balashev
arm
and
moving
few
steps
away
from
his
suite
which
waited
respectfully
began
pace
and
down
with
him
trying
speak
significantly
referred
the
fact
that
the
emperor
napoleon
had
resented
the
demand
that
should
withdraw
his
troops
from
prussia
especially
when
that
demand
became
generally
known
and
the
dignity
france
was
thereby
offended
royalty
has
its
obligations
balashev
replied
that
there
was
nothing
offensive
the
demand
because
but
murat
interrupted
him
then
you
don
consider
the
emperor
alexander
the
aggressor
asked
unexpectedly
with
kindly
and
foolish
smile
balashev
told
him
why
considered
napoleon
the
originator
the
war
dear
general
murat
again
interrupted
him
with
all
heart
wish
the
emperors
may
arrange
the
affair
between
them
and
that
the
war
begun
wish
mine
may
finish
quickly
possible
said
the
tone
servant

good

with

despite

between
their
masters
and
went
inquiries
about
the
grand
duke
and
the
state
his
health
and
reminiscences
the
gay
and
amusing
times
had
spent
with
him
naples
then
suddenly
remembering
his
royal
dignity
murat
solemnly
drew
himself
assumed
the
pose
which
had
stood
his
coronation
and
waving
his
right
arm
said
won
detain
you
longer
general
wish
success
your

and
with
his
embroidered
red
mantle
his
flowing
feathers
and
his
glittering
ornaments
rejoined
his
suite
who
were
respectfully
awaiting
him
balashev
rode
supposing
from
murat
words
that
would
very
soon
brought
before
napoleon
himself
but
instead
that
the
next

the

davout

detained
him
the

the

had
done
and

the

was
fetched
conducted
him
into
the
village
marshal
davout
chapter
davout
was
napoleon
what
arakcheev
was
alexander
though
not
coward
like
arakcheev
was
precise
cruel
and
unable
express
his
devotion
his
monarch
except
cruelty
the
organism
states
such
men
are
necessary
wolves
are
necessary
the

nature
and
they
always
exist
always
appear
and
hold
their
own
however
incongruous
their
presence
and
their
proximity
the
head
the
government
may
this
inevitability
alone
can
explain
how
the
cruel
arakcheev
who
tore
out
grenadier
mustache
with
his
own
hands
whose
weak
nerves
rendered
him
unable
face
danger
and
who
was
neither
educated
man
nor
courtier
was
able
maintain
his
powerful
position
with
alexander
whose
own
character
was
chivalrous
noble
and
gentle
balashev
found
davout
seated
barrel
the
shed
peasant
hut
writing
was
auditing
accounts
better
quarters
could
have
been
found
him
but
marshal
davout
was
one
those
men
who
purposely
put
themselves
most
depressing
conditions
have
justification
for
being
gloomy
for
the
same
reason
they
are
always
hard
work
and
hurry
how
can
think
the
bright
side
life
when
you
see
sitting
barrel
and
working
dirty
shed
the
expression
his
face
seemed
say
the
chief
pleasure
and
necessity
such
men
when
they
encounter
anyone
who
shows
animation
flaunt
their
own
dreary
persistent
activity
davout
allowed
himself
that
pleasure
when
balashev
was
brought
became
still
more
absorbed
his
task
when
the
russian
general
entered
and
after
glancing
over
his
spectacles
balashev
face
which
was
animated
the
beauty
the
morning
and
his
talk
with
murat
did
not
rise
even
stir
but
scowled
still
more
and
sneered
malevolently
when
noticed
balashev
face
the
disagreeable
impression
this
reception
produced
davout
raised
his
head
and
coldly
asked
what
wanted
thinking
could
have
been
received
such
manner
only
because
davout
did
not
know
that
was
adjutant
general
the
emperor
alexander
and
even
his
envoy
napoleon
balashev
hastened
inform
him
his
rank
and
mission
contrary
his
expectation
davout
after
hearing
him
became
still
surlier
and
ruder
where
your
dispatch
inquired

balashev
replied
that
had
been
ordered

personally

your

took
out
the

and
laid
the

still
hanging

across

davout
took
the

and
read
the

and
putting

him
into

were
waiting

said
that
napoleon
would
receive
the
russian
general
before
going
for
his
ride
after
some
minutes
the
gentleman
waiting
who
was

came
into
the
great
reception
room
and
bowing
politely
asked
balashev
follow
him
balashev
went
into
small
reception
room
one
door
which
led
into
study
the
very
one
from
which
the
russian
emperor
had
dispatched
him
his
mission
stood
minute
two
waiting
heard
hurried
footsteps
beyond
the
door
both
halves
were
opened
rapidly
all
was
silent
and
then
from
the
study
the
sound
was
heard
other
steps
firm
and
resolute
they
were
those
napoleon
had
just
finished
dressing
for
his
ride
and
wore
blue
uniform
opening
front
over
white
waistcoat
long
that
covered
his
rotund
stomach
white
leather
breeches
tightly
fitting
the
fat
thighs
his
short
legs
and
hessian
boots
his
short
hair
had
evidently
just
been
brushed
but
one
lock
hung
down
the
middle
his
broad
forehead
his
plump
white
neck
stood
out
sharply
above
the
black
collar
his
uniform
and
smelled
eau
cologne
his
full
face
rather
young
looking
with
its
prominent
chin
wore
gracious
and
majestic
expression
imperial
welcome
entered
briskly
with
jerk
every
step
and
his
head
slightly
thrown
back
his
whole
short
corpulent
figure
with
broad
thick
shoulders
and
chest
and
stomach
involuntarily
protruding
had
that
imposing
and
stately
appearance
one
sees
men
forty
who
live
comfort
was
evident
too
that
was
the
best
spirits
that
day
nodded
answer
balashav
low
and
respectful
bow
and
coming
him
once
began
speaking
like
man
who
values
every
moment
his
time
and
does
not
condescend
prepare
what
has
say
but
sure
will
always
say
the
right
thing
and
say
well
good
day
general
said
have
received
the
letter
you
brought
from
the
emperor
alexander
and
very
glad
see
you
glanced
with
his
large
eyes
into
balashav
face
and
immediately
looked
past
him
was
plain
that
balashev
personality
did
not
interest
him
all
evidently
only
what
took
place
within
his
own
mind
interested
him
nothing
outside
himself
had
any
significance
for
him
because
everything
the
world
seemed
him
depended
entirely
his
will
not
and
did
not
desire
war
continued
but
has
been
forced
even
now
emphasized
the
word
ready
receive
any
explanations
you
can
give
and
began
clearly
and
concisely
explain
his
reasons
for
dissatisfaction
with
the
russian
government
judging
the
calmly
moderate
and
amicable
tone
which
the
french
emperor
spoke
balashev
was
firmly
persuaded
that
wished
for
peace
and
intended
enter
into
negotiations
when
napoleon
having
finished
speaking
looked
inquiringly
the
russian
envoy
balashev
began
speech
had
prepared
long
before
sire
the
emperor
master
but
the
sight
the
emperor
eyes
bent
him
confused
him
you
are
flurried
compose
yourself
napoleon
seemed
say
with
scarcely
perceptible
smile
looked
balashev
uniform
and
sword
balashev
recovered
himself
and
began
speak
said
that
the
emperor
alexander
did
not
consider
kurakin
demand
for
his
passports
sufficient
cause
for
war
that
kurakin
had
acted
his
own
initiative
and
without
his
sovereign
assent
that
the
emperor
alexander
did
not
desire
war
and
had
relations
with
england
not
yet
interposed
napoleon
and
fearing
give
vent
his
feelings
frowned
and
nodded
slightly
sign
that
balashev
might
proceed
after
saying
all
had
been
instructed
say
balashev
added
that
the
emperor
alexander
wished
for
peace
but
would
not
enter
into
negotiations
except
condition
that
here
balashev
hesitated
remembered
the
words
the
emperor
alexander
had
not
written
his
letter
but
had
specially
inserted
the
rescript
saltykov
and
had
told
balashev
repeat
napoleon
balashev
remembered
these
words
long
single
armed
foe
remains
russian
soil
but
some
complex
feeling
restrained
him
could
not
utter
them
though
wished
grew
confused
and
said
condition
that
the
french
army
retires
beyond
the
niemen
napoleon
noticed
balashev
embarrassment
when
uttering
these
last
words
his
face
twitched
and
the
calf
his
left
leg
began
quiver
rhythmically
without
moving
from
where
stood
began
speaking
louder
tone
and
more
hurriedly
than
before
during
the
speech
that
followed
balashev
who
more
than
once
lowered
his
eyes
involuntarily
noticed
the
quivering
napoleon
left
leg
which
increased
the
more
napoleon
raised
his
voice
desire
peace
less
than
the
emperor
alexander
began
have
not
for
eighteen
months
been
doing
everything
obtain
have
waited
eighteen
months
for
explanations
but
order
begin
negotiations
what
demanded
said
frowning
and
making
energetic
gesture
inquiry
with
his
small
white
plump
hand
the
withdrawal
your
army
beyond
the
niemen
sire
replied
balashev
the
niemen
repeated
napoleon
now
you
want
retire
beyond
the
niemen
only
the
niemen
repeated
napoleon
looking
straight
balashev
the
latter
bowed
his
head
respectfully
instead
the
demand
four
months
earlier
withdraw
from
pomerania
only
withdrawal
beyond
the
niemen
was
now
demanded
napoleon
turned
quickly
and
began
pace
the
room
you
say
the
demand
now
that
withdraw
beyond
the
niemen
before
commencing
negotiations
but
just
the
same
way
two
months
ago
the
demand
was
that
should
withdraw
beyond
the
vistula
and
the
oder
and
yet
you
are
willing
negotiate
went
silence
from
one
corner
the
room
the
other
and
again
stopped
front
balashev
balashev
noticed
that
his
left
leg
was
quivering
faster
than
before
and
his
face
seemed
petrified
its
stern
expression
this
quivering
his
left
leg
was
thing
napoleon
was
conscious
the
vibration
left
calf
great
sign
with
remarked
later
date
such
demands
retreat
beyond
the
vistula
and
oder
may
made
prince
baden
but
not
napoleon
almost
screamed
quite
his
own
surprise
you
gave
petersburg
and
moscow
could
not
accept
such
conditions
you
say
have
begun
this
war
but
who
first
joined
his
army
the
emperor
alexander
not
and
you
offer
negotiations
when
have
expended
millions
when
you
are
alliance
with
england
and
when
your
position
bad
one
you
offer
negotiations
but
what
the
aim
your
alliance
with
england
what
has
she
given
you
continued
hurriedly
evidently
longer
trying
show
the
advantages
peace
and
discuss
its
possibility
but
only
prove
his
own
rectitude
and
power
and
alexander
errors
and
duplicity
the
commencement
his
speech
had
obviously
been
made
with
the
intention
demonstrating
the
advantages
his
position
and
showing
that
was
nevertheless
willing
negotiate
but
had
begun
talking
and
the
more
talked
the
less
could
control
his
words
the
whole
purport
his
remarks
now
was
evidently
exalt
himself
and
insult
alexander
just
what
had
least
desired
the
commencement
the
interview
hear
you
have
made
peace
with
turkey
balashev
bowed
his
head
affirmatively
peace
has
been
concluded
began
but
napoleon
did
not
let
him
speak
evidently
wanted
all
the
talking
himself
and
continued
talk
with
the
sort
eloquence
and
unrestrained
irritability
which
spoiled
people
are
prone
yes
know
you
have
made
peace
with
the
turks
without
obtaining
moldavia
and
wallachia
would
have
given
your
sovereign
those
provinces
gave
him
finland
yes
went
promised
and
would
have
given
the
emperor
alexander
moldavia
and
wallachia
and
now
won
have
those
splendid
provinces
yet
might
have
united
them
his
empire
and
single
reign
would
have
extended
russia
from
the
gulf
bothnia
the
mouths
the
danube
catherine
the
great
could
not
have
done
more
said
napoleon
growing
more
and
more
excited
paced
and
down
the
room
repeating
balashev
almost
the
very
words
had
used
alexander
himself
tilsit
all
that
would
have
owed
friendship
what
splendid
reign
repeated
several
times
then
paused
drew
from
his
pocket
gold
snuffbox
lifted
his
nose
and
greedily
sniffed
what
splendid
reign
the
emperor
alexander
might
have
been
looked
compassionately
balashev
and
soon
the
latter
tried
make
some
rejoinder
hastily
interrupted
him
what
could
wish
look
for
that
would
not
have
obtained
through
friendship
demanded
napoleon
shrugging
his
shoulders
perplexity
but
has
preferred
surround
himself
with
enemies
and
with
whom
with
steins

rather
more
soldier
than
the
others
but
all
the
same
incompetent
who
was
unable
anything
and
who
should
awaken
terrible
memories
the
emperor
alexander
mind
granted
that
were
they
competent
they
might
made
use
continued
napoleon
hardly
able
keep
pace
words
with
the
rush
thoughts
that
incessantly
sprang
proving
how
right
and
strong
was
his
perception
the
two
were
one
and
the
same
but
they
are
not
even
that
they
are
neither
fit
for
war
nor
peace
barclay
said
the
most
capable
them
all
but
cannot
say
judging
his

movements
and
what
are
they
doing

alone
military
man
stupid
but
has
experience

and
resolution
and
what
role
your
young
monarch
playing
that
monstrous
crowd
they
compromise
him
and
throw
him
the
responsibility
for
all
that
happens
sovereign
should
not
with
the
army
unless
general
said
napoleon
evidently
uttering
these
words
direct
challenge
the
emperor
knew
how
alexander
desired
military
commander
the
campaign
began
only
week
ago
and
you
haven
even
been
able
defend
vilna
you
are
cut
two
and
have
been
driven
out
the
polish
provinces
your
army
grumbling
the
contrary
your
majesty
said
balashev
hardly
able
remember
what
had
been
said
him
and
following
these
verbal
fireworks
with
difficulty
the
troops
are
burning
with
eagerness
know
everything
napoleon
interrupted
him
know
everything
know
the
number
your
battalions
exactly
know
own
you
have
not
two
hundred
thousand
men
and
have
three
times
that
number
give
you
word
honor
said
napoleon
forgetting
that
his
word
honor
could
carry
weight
give
you
word
honor
that
have
five
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
men
this
side
the
vistula
the
turks
will
use
you
they
are
worth
nothing
and
have
shown
making
peace
with
you
for
the
swedes
their
fate
governed
mad
kings
their
king
was
insane
and
they
changed
him
for
another
bernadotte
who
promptly
went
mad
for
swede
would
ally
himself
with
russia
unless
were
mad
napoleon
grinned
maliciously
and
again
raised
his
snuffbox
his
nose
balashev
knew
how
reply
each
napoleon
remarks
and
would
have
done
continually
made
the
gesture
man
wishing
say
something
but
napoleon
always
interrupted
him
the
alleged
insanity
the
swedes
balashev
wished
reply
that
when
russia
her
side
sweden
practically
island
but
napoleon
gave
angry
exclamation
drown
his
voice
napoleon
was
that
state
irritability
which
man
has
talk
talk
and
talk
merely
convince
himself
that
the
right
balashev
began
feel
uncomfortable
envoy
feared
demean
his
dignity
and
felt
the
necessity
replying
but
man
shrank
before
the
transport
groundless
wrath
that
had
evidently
seized
napoleon
knew
that
none
the
words
now
uttered
napoleon
had
any
significance
and
that
napoleon
himself
would
ashamed
them
when
came
his
senses
balashev
stood
with
downcast
eyes
looking
the
movements
napoleon
stout
legs
and
trying
avoid
meeting
his
eyes
but
what
care
about
your
allies
said
napoleon
have
allies
the
poles
there
are
eighty
thousand
them
and
they
fight
like
lions
and
there
will
two
hundred
thousand
them
and
probably
still
more
perturbed
the
fact
that
had
uttered
this
obvious
falsehood
and
that
balashev
still
stood
silently
before
him
the
same
attitude
submission
fate
napoleon
abruptly
turned
round
drew
close
balashev
face
and
gesticulating
rapidly
and
energetically
with
his
white
hands
almost
shouted
know
that
you
stir
prussia
against
wipe
off
the
map
europe
declared
his
face
pale
and
distorted
anger
and
struck
one
his
small
hands
energetically
with
the
other
yes
will
throw
you
back
beyond
the
dvina
and
beyond
the
dnieper
and
will
erect
against
you
that
barrier
which
was
criminal
and
blind
europe
allow
destroyed
yes
that
what
will
happen
you
that
what
you
have
gained
alienating
and
walked
silently
several
times
and
down
the
room
his
fat
shoulders
twitching
put
his
snuffbox
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
took
out
again
lifted
several
times
his
nose
and
stopped
front
balashev
paused
looked
ironically
straight
into
balashev
eyes
and
said
quiet
voice
and
yet
what
splendid
reign
your
master
might
have
had
balashev
feeling
incumbent
him
reply
said
that
from
the
russian
side
things
did
not
appear
gloomy
light
napoleon
was
silent
still
looking
derisively
him
and
evidently
not
listening
him
balashev
said
that
russia
the
best
results
were
expected
from
the
war
napoleon
nodded
condescendingly
say
know
your
duty
say
that
but
you
don
believe
yourself
have
convinced
you
when
balashev
had
ended
napoleon
again
took
out
his
snuffbox
sniffed
and
stamped
his
foot
twice
the
floor
signal
the
door
opened
gentleman
waiting
bending
respectfully
handed
the
emperor
his
hat
and
gloves
another
brought
him
pocket
handkerchief
napoleon
without
giving
them
glance
turned
balashev
assure
the
emperor
alexander
from
said
taking
his
hat
that
devoted
him
before
know
him
thoroughly
and
very
highly
esteem
his
lofty
qualities
will
detain
you
longer
general
you
shall
receive
letter
the
emperor
and
napoleon
went
quickly
the
door
everyone
the
reception
room
rushed
forward
and
descended
the
staircase
chapter
vii
after
all
that
napoleon
had
said
him
those
bursts
anger
and
the
last
dryly
spoken
words
will
detain
you
longer
general
you
shall
receive
letter
balashev
felt
convinced
that
napoleon
would
not
wish
see
him
and
would
even
avoid
another
meeting
with
him
insulted
envoy
especially
had
witnessed
his
unseemly
anger
but
his
surprise
balashev
received
through
duroc
invitation
dine
with
the
emperor
that
day
bessieres
caulaincourt
and
berthier
were
present
that
dinner
napoleon
met
balashev
cheerfully
and
amiably
not
only
showed
sign
constraint
self
reproach
account
his
outburst
that
morning
but
the
contrary
tried
reassure
balashev
was
evident
that
had
long
been
convinced
that
was
impossible
for
him
make
mistake
and
that
his
perception
whatever
did
was
right
not
because
harmonized
with
any
idea
right
and
wrong
but
because
did
the
emperor
was
very
good
spirits
after
his
ride
through
vilna
where
crowds
people
had
rapturously
greeted
and
followed
him
from
all
the
windows
the
streets
through
which
rode
rugs
flags
and
his
monogram
were
displayed
and
the
polish
ladies
welcoming
him
waved
their
handkerchiefs
him
dinner
having
placed
balashev
beside
him
napoleon
not
only
treated
him
amiably
but
behaved
balashev
were
one
his
own
courtiers
one
those
who
sympathized
with
his
plans
and
ought
rejoice
his
success
the
course
conversation
mentioned
moscow
and
questioned
balashev
about
the
russian
capital
not
merely
interested
traveler
asks
about
new
city
intends
visit
but
convinced
that
balashev
russian
must
flattered
his
curiosity
how
many
inhabitants
are
there
moscow
how
many
houses
true
that
moscow
called
holy
moscow
how
many
churches
are
there
moscow
asked
and
receiving
the
reply
that
there
were
more
than
two
hundred
churches
remarked
why
such
quantity
churches
the
russians
are
very
devout
replied
balashev
but
large
number
monasteries
and
churches
always
sign
the
backwardness
people
said
napoleon
turning
caulaincourt
for
appreciation
this
remark
balashev
respectfully
ventured
disagree
with
the
french
emperor
every
country
has
its
own
character
said
but
nowhere
europe
there
anything
like
that
said
napoleon
beg
your
majesty
pardon
returned
balashev
besides
russia
there
spain
where
there
are
also
many
churches
and
monasteries
this
reply
balashev
which
hinted
the
recent
defeats
the
french
spain
was
much
appreciated
when
related
alexander
court
but
was
not
much
appreciated
napoleon
dinner
where
passed
unnoticed
the
uninterested
and
perplexed
faces
the
marshals
showed
that
they
were
puzzled
what
balashev
tone
suggested
there
point
don
see
not
all
witty
their
expressions
seemed
say
little
was
his
rejoinder
appreciated
that
napoleon
did
not
notice
all
and
naively
asked
balashev
through
what
towns
the
direct
road
from
there
moscow
passed
balashev
who
was
the
alert
all
through
the
dinner
replied
that
just
all
roads
lead
rome
all
roads
lead
moscow
there
were
many
roads
and
among
them
the
road
through
poltava
which
charles
xii
chose
balashev
involuntarily
flushed
with
pleasure
the
aptitude
this
reply
but
hardly
had
uttered
the
word
poltava
before
caulaincourt
began
speaking
the
badness
the
road
from
petersburg
moscow
and
his
petersburg
reminiscences
after
dinner
they
went
drink
coffee
napoleon
study
which
four
days
previously
had
been
that
the
emperor
alexander
napoleon
sat
down
toying
with
his
sevres
coffee
cup
and
motioned
balashev
chair
beside
him
napoleon
was
that
well
known
after
dinner
mood
which
more
than
any
reasoned
cause
makes
man
contented
with
himself
and
disposed
consider
everyone
his
friend
seemed
him
that
was
surrounded
men
who
adored
him
and
felt
convinced
that
after
his
dinner
balashev
too
was
his
friend
and
worshiper
napoleon
turned
him
with
pleasant
though
slightly
ironic
smile
they
tell
this
the
room
the
emperor
alexander
occupied
strange
isn
general
said
evidently
not
doubting
that
this
remark
would
agreeable
his
hearer
since
went
prove
his
napoleon
superiority
alexander
balashev
made
reply
and
bowed
his
head
silence
yes
four
days
ago
this
room
wintzingerode
and
stein
were
deliberating
continued
napoleon
with
the
same
derisive
and
self
confident
smile
what
can
understand
went
that
the
emperor
alexander
has
surrounded
himself
with
personal
enemies
that
not
understand
has
not
thought
that
may
the
same
and
turned
inquiringly
balashev
and
evidently
this
thought
turned
him
back
the
track
his
morning
anger
which
was
still
fresh
him
and
let
him
know
that
will
said
napoleon
rising
and
pushing
his
cup
away
with
his
hand
drive
all
his
wurttemberg
baden
and
weimar
relations
out
germany
yes
drive
them
out
let
him
prepare
asylum
for
them
russia
balashev
bowed
his
head
with
air
indicating
that
would
like
make
his
bow
and
leave
and
only
listened
because
could
not
help
hearing
what
was
said
him
napoleon
did
not
notice
this
expression
treated
balashev
not
envoy
from
his
enemy
but
man
now
fully
devoted
him
and
who
must
rejoice
his
former
master
humiliation
and
why
has
the
emperor
alexander
taken
command
the
armies
what
the
good
that
war
profession
but
his
business
reign
and
not
command
armies
why
has
taken
himself
such
responsibility
again
napoleon
brought
out
his
snuffbox
paced
several
times
and
down
the
room
silence
and
then
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
went
balashev
and
with
slight
smile
confidently
quickly
and
simply
were
doing
something
not
merely
important
but
pleasing
balashev
raised
his
hand
the
forty
year
old
russian
general
face
and
taking
him
the
ear
pulled
gently
smiling
with
his
lips
only
have
one
ear
pulled
the
emperor
was
considered
the
greatest
honor
and
mark
favor
the
french
court
well
adorer
and
courtier
the
emperor
alexander
why
don
you
say
anything
said
was
ridiculous
his
presence
the
adorer
and
courtier
anyone
but
himself
napoleon
are
the
horses
ready
for
the
general
added
with
slight
inclination
his
head
reply
balashev
bow
let
him
have
mine
has
long
way
the
letter
taken
balashev
was
the
last
napoleon
sent
alexander
every
detail
the
interview
was
communicated
the
russian
monarch
and
the
war
began
chapter
viii
after
his
interview
with
pierre
moscow
prince
andrew
went
petersburg
business
told
his
family
but
really
meet
anatole
kuragin
whom
felt
necessary
encounter
reaching
petersburg
inquired
for
kuragin
but
the
latter
had
already
left
the
city
pierre
had
warned
his
brother
law
that
prince
andrew
was
his
track
anatole
kuragin
promptly
obtained
appointment
from
the
minister
war
and
went
join
the
army
moldavia
while
petersburg
prince
andrew
met
kutuzov
his
former
commander
who
was
always
well
disposed
toward
him
and
kutuzov
suggested
that
should
accompany
him
the
army
moldavia
which
the
old
general
had
been
appointed
commander
chief
prince
andrew
having
received
appointment
the
headquarters
staff
left
for
turkey
prince
andrew
did
not
think
proper
write
and
challenge
kuragin
thought
that
challenged
him
without
some
fresh
cause
might
compromise
the
young
countess
rostova
and
wanted
meet
kuragin
personally
order
find
fresh
pretext
for
duel
but
again
failed
meet
kuragin
turkey
for
soon
after
prince
andrew
arrived
the
latter
returned
russia
new
country
amid
new
conditions
prince
andrew
found
life
easier
bear
after
his
betrothed
had
broken
faith
with
him
which
felt
the
more
acutely
the
more
tried
conceal
its
effects
the
surroundings
which
had
been
happy
became
trying
him
and
the
freedom
and
independence
had
once
prized
highly
were
still
more
not
only
could
longer
think
the
thoughts
that
had
first
come
him
lay
gazing
the
sky
the
field
austerlitz
and
had
later
enlarged
upon
with
pierre
and
which
had
filled
his
solitude
bogucharovo
and
then
switzerland
and
rome
but
even
dreaded
recall
them
and
the
bright
and
boundless
horizons
they
had
revealed
was
now
concerned
only
with
the
nearest
practical
matters
unrelated
his
past
interests
and
seized
these
the
more
eagerly
the
more
those
past
interests
were
closed
him
was
that
lofty
infinite
canopy
heaven
that
had
once
towered
above
him
had
suddenly
turned
into
low
solid
vault
that
weighed
him
down
which
all
was
clear
but
nothing
eternal
mysterious
the
activities
that
presented
themselves
him
army
service
was
the
simplest
and
most
familiar
general
duty
kutuzov
staff
applied
himself
business
with
zeal
and
perseverance
and
surprised
kutuzov
his
willingness
and
accuracy
work
not
having
found
kuragin
turkey
prince
andrew
did
not
think
necessary
rush
back
russia
after
him
but
all
the
same
knew
that
however
long
might
before
met
kuragin
despite
his
contempt
for
him
and
despite
all
the
proofs
deduced
convince
himself
that
was
not
worth
stooping
conflict
with
him
knew
that
when
did
meet
him
would
not
able
resist
calling
him
out
any
more
than
ravenous
man
can
help
snatching
food
and
the
consciousness
that
the
insult
was
not
yet
avenged
that
his
rancor
was
still
unspent
weighed
his
heart
and
poisoned
the
artificial
tranquillity
which
managed
obtain
turkey
means
restless
plodding
and
rather
vainglorious
and
ambitious
activity
the
year
when
news
the
war
with
napoleon
reached
bucharest
where
kutuzov
had
been
living
for
two
months
passing
his
days
and
nights
with
wallachian
woman
prince
andrew
asked
kutuzov
transfer
him
the
western
army
kutuzov
who
was
already
weary
bolkonski
activity
which
seemed
reproach
his
own
idleness
very
readily
let
him
and
gave
him
mission
barclay
tolly
before
joining
the
western
army
which
was
then
may
encamped
drissa
prince
andrew
visited
bald
hills
which
was
directly
his
way
being
only
two
miles
off
the
smolensk
highroad
during
the
last
three
years
there
had
been
many
changes
his
life
had
thought
felt
and
seen
much
having
traveled
both
the
east
and
the
west
that
reaching
bald
hills
struck
him
strange
and
unexpected
find
the
way
life
there
unchanged
and
still
the
same
every
detail
entered
through
the
gates
with
their
stone
pillars
and
drove
the
avenue
leading
the
house
were
entering
enchanted
sleeping
castle
the
same
old
stateliness
the
same
cleanliness
the
same
stillness
reigned
there
and
inside
there
was
the
same
furniture
the
same
walls
sounds
and
smell
and
the
same
timid
faces
only
somewhat
older
princess
mary
was
still
the
same
timid
plain
maiden
getting
years
uselessly
and
joylessly
passing
the
best
years
her
life
fear
and
constant
suffering
mademoiselle
bourienne
was
the
same
coquettish
self
satisfied
girl
enjoying
every
moment
her
existence
and
full
joyous
hopes
for
the
future
she
had
merely
become
more
self
confident
prince
andrew
thought
dessalles
the
tutor
had
brought
from
switzerland
was
wearing
coat
russian
cut
and
talking
broken
russian
the
servants
but
was
still
the
same
narrowly
intelligent
conscientious
and
pedantic
preceptor
the
old
prince
had
changed
appearance
only
the
loss
tooth
which
left
noticeable
gap
one
side
his
mouth
character
was
the
same
ever
only
showing
still
more
irritability
and
skepticism
what
was
happening
the
world
little
nicholas
alone
had
changed
had
grown
become
rosier
had
curly
dark
hair
and
when
merry
and
laughing
quite
unconsciously
lifted
the
upper
lip
his
pretty
little
mouth
just
the
little
princess
used
alone
did
not
obey
the
law
immutability
the
enchanted
sleeping
castle
but
though
externally
all
remained
old
the
inner
relations
all
these
people
had
changed
since
prince
andrew
had
seen
them
last
the
household
was
divided
into
two
alien
and
hostile
camps
who
changed
their
habits
for
his
sake
and
only
met
because
was
there
the
one
camp
belonged
the
old
prince
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
the
architect
the
other
princess
mary
dessalles
little
nicholas
and
all
the
old
nurses
and
maids
during
his
stay
bald
hills
all
the
family
dined
together
but
they
were
ill
ease
and
prince
andrew
felt
that
was
visitor
for
whose
sake
exception
was
being
made
and
that
his
presence
made
them
all
feel
awkward
involuntarily
feeling
this
dinner
the
first
day
was
taciturn
and
the
old
prince
noticing
this
also
became
morosely
dumb
and
retired
his
apartments
directly
after
dinner
the
evening
when
prince
andrew
went
him
and
trying
rouse
him
began
tell
him
the
young
count
kamensky
campaign
the
old
prince
began
unexpectedly
talk
about
princess
mary
blaming
her
for
her
superstitions
and
her
dislike
mademoiselle
bourienne
who
said
was
the
only
person
really
attached
him
the
old
prince
said
that
was
ill
was
only
because
princess
mary
that
she
purposely
worried
and
irritated
him
and
that
indulgence
and
silly
talk
she
was
spoiling
little
prince
nicholas
the
old
prince
knew
very
well
that
tormented
his
daughter
and
that
her
life
was
very
hard
but
also
knew
that
could
not
help
tormenting
her
and
that
she
deserved
why
does
prince
andrew
who
sees
this
say
nothing
about
his
sister
does
think
scoundrel
old
fool
who
without
any
reason
keeps
his
own
daughter
distance
and
attaches
this
frenchwoman
himself
doesn
understand
must
explain
and
must
hear
out
thought
the
old
prince
and
began
explaining
why
could
not
put
with
his
daughter
unreasonable
character
you
ask
said
prince
andrew
without
looking
was
censuring
his
father
for
the
first
time
his
life
did
not
wish
speak
about
but
you
ask
will
give
you
frank
opinion
there
any
misunderstanding
and
discord
between
you
and
mary
can
blame
her
for
all
know
how
she
loves
and
respects
you
since
you
ask
continued
prince
andrew
becoming
irritable
was
always
liable
late
can
only
say
that
there
are
any
misunderstandings
they
are
caused
that
worthless
woman
who
not
fit
sister
companion
the
old
man
first
stared
fixedly
his
son
and
unnatural
smile
disclosed
the
fresh
gap
between
his
teeth
which
prince
andrew
could
not
get
accustomed
what
companion
dear
boy
you
already
been
talking
over
father
did
not
want
judge
said
prince
andrew
hard
and
bitter
tone
but
you
challenged
and
have
said
and
always
shall
say
that
mary
not
blame
but
those
blame
the
one
blame
that
frenchwoman
has
passed
judgment
passed
judgement
said
the
old
man
low
voice
and
seemed
prince
andrew
with
some
embarrassment
but
then
suddenly
jumped
and
cried
off
off
let
not
trace
you
remain
here
prince
andrew
wished
leave
once
but
princess
mary
persuaded
him
stay
another
day
that
day
did
not
see
his
father
who
did
not
leave
his
room
and
admitted
one
but
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
tikhon
but
asked
several
times
whether
his
son
had
gone
next
day
before
leaving
prince
andrew
went
his
son
rooms
the
boy
curly
headed
like
his
mother
and
glowing
with
health
sat
his
knee
and
prince
andrew
began
telling
him
the
story
bluebeard
but
fell
into
reverie
without
finishing
the
story
thought
not
this
pretty
child
his
son
whom
held
his
knee
but
himself
sought
himself
either
remorse
for
having
angered
his
father
regret
leaving
home
for
the
first
time
his
life
bad
terms
with
him
and
was
horrified
find
neither
what
meant
still
more
him
was
that
sought
and
did
not
find
himself
the
former
tenderness
for
his
son
which
had
hoped
reawaken
caressing
the
boy
and
taking
him
his
knee
well
said
his
son
prince
andrew
without
replying
put
him
down
from
his
knee
and
went
out
the
room
soon
prince
andrew
had
given
his
daily
occupations
and
especially
returning
the
old
conditions
life
amid
which
had
been
happy
weariness
life
overcame
him
with
its
former
intensity
and
hastened
escape
from
these
memories
and
find
some
work
soon
possible
you
decided
andrew
asked
his
sister
thank
god
that
can
replied
prince
andrew
very
sorry
you
can
why
you
say
that
replied
princess
mary
why
you
say
that
when
you
are
going
this
terrible
war
and
old
mademoiselle
bourienne
says
has
been
asking
about
you
soon
she
began
speak
that
her
lips
trembled
and
her
tears
began
fall
prince
andrew
turned
away
and
began
pacing
the
room
god
god
when
one
thinks
who
and
what
what
trash
can
cause
people
misery
said
with
malignity
that
alarmed
princess
mary
she
understood
that
when
speaking
trash
referred
not
only
mademoiselle
bourienne
the
cause
her
misery
but
also
the
man
who
had
ruined
his
own
happiness
andrew
one
thing
beg
entreat
you
she
said
touching
his
elbow
and
looking
him
with
eyes
that
shone
through
her
tears
understand
you
she
looked
down
don
imagine
that
sorrow
the
work
men
men
are
his
tools
she
looked
little
above
prince
andrew
head
with
the
confident
accustomed
look
with
which
one
looks
the
place
where
familiar
portrait
hangs
sorrow
sent
him
not
men
men
are
his
instruments
they
are
not
blame
you
think
someone
has
wronged
you
forget
and
forgive
have
right
punish
and
then
you
will
know
the
happiness
forgiving
were
woman
would
mary
that
woman
virtue
but
man
should
not
and
cannot
forgive
and
forget
replied
and
though
till
that
moment
had
not
been
thinking
kuragin
all
his
unexpended
anger
suddenly
swelled
his
heart
mary
already
persuading
forgive
means
that
ought
long
ago
have
punished
him
thought
and
giving
her
further
reply
began
thinking
the
glad
vindictive
moment
when
would
meet
kuragin
who
knew
was
now
the
army
princess
mary
begged
him
stay
one
day
more
saying
that
she
knew
how
unhappy
her
father
would
andrew
left
without
being
reconciled
him
but
prince
andrew
replied
that
would
probably
soon
back
again
from
the
army
and
would
certainly
write
his
father
but
that
the
longer
stayed
now
the
more
embittered
their
differences
would
become
good
bye
andrew
remember
that
misfortunes
come
from
god
and
men
are
never
blame
were
the
last
words
heard
from
his
sister
when
took
leave
her
then
must
thought
prince
andrew
drove
out
the
avenue
from
the
house
bald
hills
she
poor
innocent
creature
left
victimized
old
man
who
has
outlived
his
wits
the
old
man
feels
guilty
but
cannot
change
himself
boy
growing
and
rejoices
life
which
like
everybody
else
will
deceive
deceived
and
off
the
army
why
myself
don
know
want
meet
that
man
whom
despise
give
him
chance
kill
and
laugh
these
conditions
life
had
been
the
same
before
but
then
they
were
all
connected
while
now
they
had
all
tumbled
pieces
only
senseless
things
lacking
coherence
presented
themselves
one
after
another
prince
andrew
mind
chapter
prince
andrew
reached
the
general
headquarters
the
army
the
end
june
the
first
army
with
which
was
the
emperor
occupied
the
fortified
camp
drissa
the
second
army
was
retreating
trying
effect
junction
with
the
first
one
from
which
was
said
cut
off
large
french
forces
everyone
was
dissatisfied
with
the
general
course
affairs
the
russian
army
but
one
anticipated
any
danger
invasion
the
russian
provinces
and
one
thought
the
war
would
extend
farther
than
the
western
the
polish
provinces
prince
andrew
found
barclay
tolly
whom
had
been
assigned
the
bank
the
drissa
there
was
not
single
town
large
village
the
vicinity
the
camp
the
immense
number
generals
and
courtiers
accompanying
the
army
were
living
the
best
houses
the
villages
both
sides
the
river
over
radius
six
miles
barclay
tolly
was
quartered
nearly
three
miles
from
the
emperor
received
bolkonski
stiffly
and
coldly
and
told
him
his
foreign
accent
that
would
mention
him
the
emperor
for
decision
his
employment
but
asked
him
meanwhile
remain
his
staff
anatole
kuragin
whom
prince
andrew
had
hoped
find
with
the
army
was
not
there
had
gone
petersburg
but
prince
andrew
was
glad
hear
this
his
mind
was
occupied
the
interests
the
center
that
was
conducting
gigantic
war
and
was
glad
free
for
while
from
the
distraction
caused
the
thought
kuragin
during
the
first
four
days
while
duties
were
required
him
prince
andrew
rode
round
the
whole
fortified
camp
and
the
aid
his
own
knowledge
and
talks
with
experts
tried
form
definite
opinion
about
but
the
question
whether
the
camp
was
advantageous
disadvantageous
remained
for
him
undecided
already
from
his
military
experience
and
what
had
seen
the
austrian
campaign
had
come
the
conclusion
that
war
the
most
deeply
considered
plans
have
significance
and
that
all
depends
the
way
unexpected
movements
the
enemy
that
cannot
foreseen
are
met
and
how
and
whom
the
whole
matter
handled
clear
this
last
point
for
himself
prince
andrew
utilizing
his
position
and
acquaintances
tried
fathom
the
character
the
control
the
army
and
the
men
and
parties
engaged
and
deduced
for
himself
the
following
the
state
affairs
while
the
emperor
had
still
been
vilna
the
forces
had
been
divided
into
three
armies
first
the
army
under
barclay
tolly
secondly
the
army
under
bagration
and
thirdly
the
one
commanded
tormasov
the
emperor
was
with
the
first
army
but
not
commander
chief
the
orders
issued
was
stated
not
that
the
emperor
would
take
command
but
only
that
would
with
the
army
the
emperor
moreover
had
with
him
not

their
position
gave
them
influence
and
often
corps

even
the
commander

did
not
know
what
capacity
was
questioned
bennigsen
the
grand

arakcheev
prince
volkonski
was
given
this
that
advice
and
did
not
know
whether
certain
order
received
the
form
advice
emanated
from
the
man
who
gave
from
the
emperor
and
whether
had
executed
not
but
this
was
only
the
external
condition
the
essential
significance
the
presence
the
emperor
and
all
these
people
from
courtier
point
view
and
emperor
vicinity
all
became
courtiers
was
clear
everyone
was
this
the
emperor
did
not
assume
the
title
commander
chief
but
disposed
all
the
armies
the
men
around
him
were
his
assistants
arakcheev
was
faithful
custodian
enforce
order
and
acted
the
sovereign
bodyguard
bennigsen
was
landlord
the
vilna
province
who
appeared
doing
the
honors
the
district
but
was
reality
good
general
useful
adviser
and
ready
hand
replace
barclay
the
grand
duke
was
there
because
suited
him
the
minister
stein
was
there
because
his
advice
was
useful
and
the
emperor
alexander
held
him
high
esteem
personally
armfeldt
virulently
hated
napoleon
and
was
general
full
self
confidence
quality
that
always
influenced
alexander
paulucci
was
there
because
was
bold
and
decided
speech
the
adjutants
general
were
there
because
they
always
accompanied
the
emperor
and
lastly
and
chiefly
pfuel
was
there
because
had
drawn
the
plan
campaign
against
napoleon
and
having
induced
alexander
believe
the
efficacy
that
plan
was
directing
the
whole
business
the
war
with
pfuel
was
wolzogen
who
expressed
pfuel
thoughts
more
comprehensible
way
than
pfuel
himself
who
was
harsh
bookish
theorist
self
confident
the
point
despising
everyone
else
was
able
besides
these
russians
and
foreigners
who
propounded
new
and
unexpected
ideas
every
day
especially
the
foreigners
who
did
with
boldness
characteristic
people
employed
country
not
their
own
there
were
many
secondary
personages
accompanying
the
army
because
their
principals
were
there
among
the
opinions
and
voices
this
immense
restless
brilliant
and
proud
sphere
prince
andrew
noticed
the
following
sharply
defined
subdivisions
tendencies
and
parties
the
first
party
consisted
pfuel
and
his
adherents
military
theorists
who
believed
science
war
with
immutable
laws
laws
oblique
movements
outflankings
and
forth
pfuel
and
his
adherents
demanded
retirement
into
the
depths
the
country
accordance
with
precise
laws
defined
pseudo
theory
war
and
they
saw
only
barbarism
ignorance
evil
intention
every
deviation
from
that
theory
this
party
belonged
the
foreign
nobles
wolzogen
wintzingerode
and
others
chiefly
germans
the
second
party
was
directly
opposed
the
first
one
extreme
always
happens
was
met
representatives
the
other
the
members
this
party
were
those
who
had
demanded
advance
from
vilna
into
poland
and
freedom
from
all
prearranged
plans
besides
being
advocates
bold
action
this
section
also
represented
nationalism
which
made
them
still
more
one
sided
the
dispute
they
were
russians
bagration
ermolov
who
was
beginning
come
the
front
and
others
that
time
famous
joke
ermolov
was
being
circulated
that
great
favor
had
petitioned
the
emperor
make
him
german
the
men
that
party
remembering
suvorov
said
that
what
one
had
was
not
reason
stick
pins
into
maps
but
fight
beat
the
enemy
keep
him
out
russia
and
not
let
the
army
get
discouraged
the
third
party
which
the
emperor
had
most
confidence
belonged
the
courtiers
who
tried
arrange
compromises
between
the
other
two
the
members
this
party
chiefly
civilians
and
whom
arakcheev
belonged
thought
and
said
what
men
who
have
convictions
but
wish
seem
have
some
generally
say
they
said
that
undoubtedly
war
particularly
against
such
genius
bonaparte
they
called
him
bonaparte
now
needs
most
deeply
devised
plans
and
profound
scientific
knowledge
and
that
respect
pfuel
was
genius
but
the
same
time
had
acknowledged
that
the
theorists
are
often
one
sided
and
therefore
one
should
not
trust
them
absolutely
but
should
also
listen
what
pfuel
opponents
and
practical
men
experience
warfare
had
say
and
then
choose
middle
course
they
insisted
the
retention
the
camp
drissa
according
pfuel
plan
but
changing
the
movements
the
other
armies
though
this
course
neither
one
aim
nor
the
other
could
attained
yet
seemed
best
the
adherents
this
third
party
fourth
opinion
the
most
conspicuous
representative
was
the
tsarevich
who
could
not
forget
his
disillusionment
austerlitz
where
had
ridden
out
the
head
the
guards
his
casque
and
cavalry
uniform
review
expecting
crush
the
french
gallantly
but
unexpectedly
finding
himself
the
front
line
had
narrowly
escaped
amid
the
general
confusion
the
men
this
party
had
both
the
quality
and
the
defect
frankness
their
opinions
they
feared
napoleon
recognized
his
strength
and
their
own
weakness
and
frankly
said
they
said
nothing
but
sorrow
shame
and
ruin
will
come
all
this
have
abandoned
vilna
and
vitebsk
and
shall
abandon
drissa
the
only
reasonable
thing
left
conclude
peace
soon
possible
before
are
turned

than
bennigsen

all
the

all

well
these
men
though
enchanted
with
the
sovereign
for
refusing
the
command
the
army
yet
blamed
him
for
such
excessive
modesty
and
only
desired
and
insisted
that
their
adored
sovereign
should
abandon
his
diffidence
and
openly
announce
that
would
place
himself

head

army
gather
round
him

unthinkable

man

his
opponent

the
day
after
merely
avoid
responsibility

the
emperor

declare
that

another

would
attract

attention
loudly
advocating
the
very
thing
the
emperor
had
hinted
the
day
before

would
dispute

council

his
breast

proving
that

stubbornly
insist
the
correctness
falsity
some
newly
emerging
opinion
and
for
this
object
would
produce
arguments
more
less
forcible
and
correct
all
the
men
this
party
were
fishing
for
rubles
decorations
and
promotions
and
this
pursuit
watched
only
the
weathercock
imperial
favor
and
directly
they
noticed
turning
any
direction
this
whole
drone
population
the
army
began
blowing
hard
that
way
that
was
all
the
harder
for
the
emperor
turn
elsewhere
amid
the
uncertainties
the
position
with
the
menace
serious
danger
giving
peculiarly
threatening
character
everything
amid
this
vortex
intrigue
egotism
conflict
views
and
feelings
and
the
diversity
race
among
these
people
this
eighth
and
largest
party
those
preoccupied
with
personal
interests
imparted
great
confusion
and
obscurity
the
common
task
whatever
question
arose
swarm
these
drones
without
having
finished
their
buzzing
previous
theme
flew
over
the
new
one
and
their
hum
drowned
and
obscured
the
voices
those
who
were
disputing
honestly
from
among
all
these
parties
just
the
time
prince
andrew
reached
the
army
another
ninth
party
was
being
formed
and
was
beginning
raise
its
voice
this
was
the
party
the
elders
reasonable
men
experienced
and
capable
state
affairs
who
without
sharing
any
those
conflicting
opinions
were
able
take
detached
view
what
was
going
the
staff
headquarters
and
consider
means
escape
from
this
muddle
indecision
intricacy
and
weakness
the
men
this
party
said
and
thought
that
what
was
wrong
resulted
chiefly
from
the
emperor
presence
the
army
with
his
military
court
and
from
the
consequent
presence
there
indefinite
conditional
and
unsteady
fluctuation
relations
which
place
court
but
harmful
army
that
sovereign
should
reign
but
not
command
the
army
and
that
the
only
way
out
the
position
would
for
the
emperor
and
his
court
leave
the
army
that
the
mere
presence
the
emperor
paralyzed
the
action
fifty
thousand
men
required
secure
his
personal
safety
and
that
the
worst
commander
chief
independent
would
better
than
the
very
best
one
trammeled
the
presence
and
authority
the
monarch
just
the
time
prince
andrew
was
living
unoccupied
drissa
shishkov
the
secretary
state
and
one
the
chief
representatives
this
party
wrote
letter
the
emperor
which
arakcheev
and
balashev
agreed
sign
this
letter
availing
himself
permission
given
him
the
emperor
discuss
the
general
course
affairs
respectfully
suggested
the
plea
that
was
necessary
for
the
sovereign
arouse
warlike
spirit
the
people
the
capital
that
the
emperor
should
leave
the
army
that
arousing
the
people
their
sovereign
and
his
call

their
country

chapter
this
letter
had
not

been
presented
the
emperor
when
barclay
one
day
dinner
informed
bolkonski
that
the
sovereign
wished

question
him
about

that

that
very
day

might
endanger

news
subsequently
found
false
and
that
morning
colonel
michaud
had
ridden
round
the
drissa
fortifications
with
the
emperor
and
had
pointed
out
him
that
this
fortified
camp
constructed
pfuel
and
till
then
considered
chef

tactical
science
which
would
ensure

and
informed
him
that

had
gone
second
time
that
day
inspect
the
fortifications
the

the
suitability
which
serious
doubts
were
beginning

chernyshev
was
sitting

with
french

his

this
room
had
probably
been
music

there
was
still

which
some
rugs
were
piled
and
one
corner
stood
the
folding
bedstead
bennigsen

this
adjutant
was
also
there
and
sat
dozing
the
rolled
bedding
evidently
exhausted
work
feasting
two
doors
led
from
the
room
one
straight
into
what
had
been
the
drawing

and
another
the
right
the

through

came
the
sound
voices
conversing
german
and
occasionally
french

were
gathered
the

not

the

preferred
indefiniteness

were

who
was

all
and
pfuel
himself
who
prince
andrew
had
heard
was
the
mainspring
the
whole
affair
prince
andrew
had
opportunity
getting
good
look
him
for
pfuel
arrived
soon
after
himself
and
passing
through
the
drawing
room
stopped
minute
speak
chernyshev
first
sight
pfuel
his
ill
made
uniform
russian
general
which
fitted
him
badly
like
fancy
costume
seemed
familiar
prince
andrew
though
saw
him
now
for
the
first
time
there
was
about
him
something
weyrother
mack
and
schmidt
and
many
other
german
theorist
generals
whom
prince
andrew
had
seen
but
was
more
typical
than
any
them
prince
andrew
had
never
yet
seen
german
theorist
whom
all
the
characteristics
those
others
were
united
such
extent
pfuel
was
short
and
very
thin
but
broad
boned
coarse
robust
build
broad
the
hips
and
with
prominent
shoulder
blades
his
face
was
much
wrinkled
and
his
eyes
deep
set
his
hair
had
evidently
been
hastily
brushed
smooth
front
the
temples
but
stuck
behind
quaint
little
tufts
entered
the
room
looking
restlessly
and
angrily
around
afraid
everything
that
large
apartment
awkwardly
holding
his
sword
addressed
chernyshev
and
asked
german
where
the
emperor
was
one
could
see
that
wished
pass
through
the
rooms
quickly
possible
finish
with
the
bows
and
greetings
and
sit
down
business
front
map
where
would
feel
home
nodded
hurriedly
reply
chernyshev
and
smiled
ironically
hearing
that
the
sovereign
was
inspecting
the
fortifications
that
pfuel
had
planned
accord
with
his
theory
muttered
something
himself
abruptly
and
bass
voice
self
assured
germans
might
have
been
stupid
fellow
the
whole
affair
will
ruined
something
absurd
will
come
prince
andrew
did
not
catch
what
said
and
would
have
passed
but
chernyshev
introduced
him
pfuel
remarking
that
prince
andrew
was
just
back
from
turkey
where
the
war
had
terminated
fortunately
pfuel
barely
glanced
not
much
prince
andrew
past
him
and
said
with
laugh
that
must
have
been
fine
tactical
war
and
laughing
contemptuously
went
into
the
room
from
which
the
sound
voices
was
heard
pfuel
always
inclined
irritably
sarcastic
was
particularly
disturbed
that
day
evidently
the
fact
that
they
had
dared
inspect
and
criticize
his
camp
his
absence
from
this
short
interview
with
pfuel
prince
andrew
thanks
his
austerlitz
experiences
was
able
form
clear
conception
the
man
pfuel
was
one
those
hopelessly
and
immutably
self
confident
men
self
confident
the
point
martyrdom
only
germans
are
because
only
germans
are
self
confident
the
basis
abstract
notion
science
that
the
supposed
knowledge
absolute
truth
frenchman
self
assured
because
regards
himself
personally
both
mind
and
body
irresistibly
attractive
men
and
women
englishman
self
assured
being
citizen
the
best
organized
state
the
world
and
therefore
englishman
always
knows
what
should
and
knows
that
all
does
englishman
undoubtedly
correct
italian
self
assured
because
excitable
and
easily
forgets
himself
and
other
people
russian
self
assured
just
because
knows
nothing
and
does
not
want
know
anything
since
does
not
believe
that
anything
can
known
the
german
self
assurance
worst
all
stronger
and
more
repulsive
than
any
other
because
imagines
that
knows
the
truth
science
which
himself
has
invented
but
which
for
him
the
absolute
truth
pfuel
was
evidently
that
sort
had
science
the
theory
oblique
movements
deduced
him
from
the
history
frederick
the
great
wars
and
all
came
across
the
history
more
recent
warfare
seemed
him
absurd
and
barbarous
monstrous
collisions
which
many
blunders
were
committed
both
sides
that
these
wars
could
not
called
wars
they
did
not
accord
with
the
theory
and
therefore
could
not
serve
material
for
science
pfuel
had
been
one
those
responsible
for
the
plan
campaign
that
ended
jena
and
auerstadt
but
did
not
see
the
least
proof
the
fallibility
his
theory
the
disasters
that
war
the
contrary
the
deviations
made
from
his
theory
were
his
opinion
the
sole
cause
the
whole
disaster
and
with
characteristically
gleeful
sarcasm
would
remark
there
said
the
whole
affair
would
the
devil
pfuel
was
one
those
theoreticians
who
love
their
theory
that
they
lose
sight
the
theory
object
its
practical
application
his
love
theory
made
him
hate
everything
practical
and
would
not
listen
was
even
pleased
failures
for
failures
resulting
from
deviations
practice
from
the
theory
only
proved
him
the
accuracy
his
theory
said
few
words
prince
andrew
and
chernyshev
about
the
present
war
with
the
air
man
who
knows
beforehand
that
all
will
wrong
and
who
not
displeased
that
should
the
unbrushed
tufts
hair
sticking
behind
and
the
hastily
brushed
hair
his
temples
expressed
this
most
eloquently
passed
into
the
next
room
and
the
deep
querulous
sounds
his
voice
were
once
heard
from
there
chapter
prince
andrew
eyes
were
still
following
pfuel
out
the
room
when
count
bennigsen
entered
hurriedly
and
nodding
bolkonski
but
not
pausing
went
into
the
study
giving
instructions
his
adjutant
went
the
emperor
was
following
him
and
bennigsen
had
hastened
make
some
preparations
and
ready
receive
the
sovereign
chernyshev
and
prince
andrew
went
out
into
the
porch
where
the
emperor
who
looked
fatigued
was
dismounting
marquis
paulucci
was
talking
him
with
particular
warmth
and
the
emperor
with
his
head
bent
the
left
was
listening
with
dissatisfied
air
the
emperor
moved
forward
evidently
wishing
end
the
conversation
but
the
flushed
and
excited
italian
oblivious
decorum
followed
him
and
continued
speak
and
for
the
man
who
advised
forming
this
camp
the
drissa
camp
said
paulucci
the
emperor
mounted
the
steps
and
noticing
prince
andrew
scanned
his
unfamiliar
face
that
person
sire
continued
paulucci
desperately
apparently
unable
restrain
himself
the
man
who
advised
the
drissa
camp
see
alternative
but
the
lunatic
asylum
the
gallows
without
heeding
the
end
the
italian
remarks
and
though
not
hearing
them
the
emperor
recognizing
bolkonski
addressed
him
graciously
very
glad
see
you
there
where
they
are
meeting
and
wait
for
the
emperor
went
into
the
study
was
followed
prince
peter
mikhaylovich
volkonski
and
baron
stein
and
the
door
closed
behind
them
prince
andrew
taking
advantage
the
emperor
permission
accompanied
paulucci
whom
had
known
turkey
into
the
drawing
room
where
the
council
was
assembled
prince
peter
mikhaylovich
volkonski
occupied
the
position
were
chief
the
emperor
staff
came
out
the
study
into
the
drawing
room
with
some
maps
which
spread
table
and
put
questions
which
wished
hear
the
opinion
the
gentlemen
present
what
had
happened
was
that
news
which
afterwards
proved
false
had
been
received
during
the
night
movement
the
french
outflank
the
drissa
camp
the
first
speak
was
general
armfeldt
who
meet
the
difficulty
that
presented
itself
unexpectedly
proposed
perfectly
new
position
away
from
the
petersburg
and
moscow
roads
the
reason
for
this
was
inexplicable
unless
wished
show
that
too
could
have
opinion
but
urged
that
this
point
the
army
should
unite
and
there
await
the
enemy
was
plain
that
armfeldt
had
thought
out
that
plan
long
ago
and
now
expounded
not
much
answer
the
questions
put
which
fact
his
plan
did
not
answer
avail
himself
the
opportunity
air
was
one
the
millions
proposals
one
good
another
that
could
made
long
was
quite
unknown
what
character
the
war
would
take
some
disputed
his
arguments
others
defended
them
young
count
toll
objected
the
swedish
general
views
more
warmly
than
anyone
else
and
the
course
the
dispute
drew
from
his
side
pocket
well
filled
notebook
which
asked
permission
read
them
these
voluminous
notes
toll
suggested
another
scheme
totally
different
from
armfeldt
pfuel
plan
campaign
answer
toll
paulucci
suggested
advance
and
attack
which
urged
could
alone
extricate
from
the
present
uncertainty
and
from
the
trap
called
the
drissa
camp
which
were
situated
during
all
these
discussions
pfuel
and
his
interpreter
wolzogen
his
bridge
court
relations
were
silent
pfuel
only
snorted
contemptuously
and
turned
away
show
that
would
never
demean
himself
replying
such
nonsense
was
now
hearing
when
prince
volkonski
who
was
the
chair
called
him
give
his
opinion
merely
said
why
ask
general
armfeldt
has
proposed
splendid
position
with
exposed
rear
why
not
this
italian
gentleman
attack
very
fine
retreat
also
good
why
ask
said
why
you
yourselves
know
everything
better
than
but
when
volkonski
said
with
frown
that
was
the
emperor
name
that
asked
his
opinion
pfuel
rose
and
suddenly
growing
animated
began
speak
everything
has
been
spoiled
everything
muddled
everybody
thought
they
knew
better
than
did
and
now
you
come
how
mend
matters
there
nothing
mend
the
principles
laid
down
must
strictly
adhered
said
drumming
the
table
with
his
bony
fingers
what
the
difficulty
nonsense
childishness
went
the
map
and
speaking
rapidly
began
proving
that
eventuality
could
alter
the
efficiency
the
drissa
camp
that
everything
had
been
foreseen
and
that
the
enemy
were
really
going
outflank
the
enemy
would
inevitably
destroyed
paulucci
who
did
not
know
german
began
questioning
him
french
wolzogen
came
the
assistance
his
chief
who
spoke
french
badly
and
began
translating
for
him
hardly
able
keep
pace
with
pfuel
who
was
rapidly
demonstrating
that
not
only
all
that
had
happened
but
all
that
could
happen
had
been
foreseen
his
scheme
and
that
there
were
now
any
difficulties
the
whole
fault
lay
the
fact
that
his
plan
had
not
been
precisely
executed
kept
laughing
sarcastically
demonstrated
and
last
contemptuously
ceased
demonstrate
like
mathematician
who
ceases
prove
various
ways
the
accuracy
problem
that
has
already
been
proved
wolzogen
took
his
place
and
continued
explain
his
views

and
then
turning
pfuel
and

not

like

all
these

prince
andrew
sympathized
most
with
pfuel
angry
determined
and
absurdly
self
confident
was
all
those
present
evidently
alone
was
not
seeking
anything
for
himself
nursed
hatred
against
anyone
and
only
desired
that
the

was
ridiculous
and
unpleasantly
sarcastic
but
yet
inspired
involuntary
respect
his
boundless
devotion
idea
besides
this
the
remarks
all
except
pfuel
had
one
common
trait
that
had
not
been
noticeable
the
council
war
there
was
now
panic
fear
napoleon
genius
which
though
concealed
was
noticeable
every
rejoinder
everything
was
assumed
possible
for
napoleon
they
expected
him
from
every
side
and
invoked
his
terrible
name
shatter
each
other
proposals
pfuel
alone
seemed
consider
napoleon
barbarian
like
everyone
else
who
opposed
his
theory
but
besides
this
feeling
respect
pfuel
evoked
pity
prince
andrew
from
the
tone
which
the
courtiers
addressed
him
and
the
way
paulucci
had
allowed
himself
speak
him
the
emperor
but
above
all
from
certain
desperation
pfuel
own
expressions
was
clear
that
the
others
knew
and
pfuel
himself
felt
that
his
fall
was
hand
and
despite
his
self
confidence
and
grumpy
german
sarcasm
was
pitiable
with
his
hair
smoothly
brushed
the
temples
and
sticking
tufts
behind
though
concealed
the
fact
under
show
irritation
and
contempt
was
evidently
despair
that
the
sole
remaining
chance
verifying
his
theory
huge
experiment
and
proving
its
soundness
the
whole
world
was
slipping
away
from
him
the
discussions
continued
long
time
and
the
longer
they
lasted
the
more
heated
became
the
disputes
culminating
shouts
and
personalities
and
the
less
was
possible
arrive
any
general
conclusion
from
all
that
had
been
said
prince
andrew
listening
this
polyglot
talk
and
these
surmises
plans
refutations
and
shouts
felt
nothing
but
amazement
what
they
were
saying
thought
that
had
long
since
and
often
occurred
him
during
his
military
activities
the
idea
that
there
not
and
cannot
any
science
war
and
that
therefore
there
can
such
thing
military
genius
now
appeared
him
obvious
truth
what
theory
and
science
possible
about
matter
the
conditions
and
circumstances
which
are
unknown
and
cannot
defined
especially
when
the
strength
the
acting
forces
cannot
ascertained
one
was
able
foresee
what
condition
our
the
enemy
armies
will
day
time
and
one
can
gauge
the
force
this
that
detachment
sometimes
when
there
not
coward

cut
off
and

running
but
brave

jolly

who
shouts

while
times
fifty

what
science
can
there
matter
which
all
practical
matters
nothing
can
defined
and
everything
depends
innumerable
conditions
the
significance
which
determined
particular
moment
which
arrives
one
knows
when
armfeldt
says
our
army
cut
half
and
paulucci
says
have
got
the
french
army
between
two
fires
michaud
says
that
the
worthlessness
the
drissa
camp
lies
having
the
river
behind
and
pfuel
says
that
what
constitutes
its
strength
toll
proposes
one
plan

another
and
they
are
all
good
and
all
bad
and
the
advantages

why
they

genius
who
can
order

brought

and
say
who

with

that

their

prince
andrew
listened
the
talking
and
roused
himself
only
when
paulucci
called
him
and
everyone
was
leaving
the
review
next
day
the
emperor
asked
prince
andrew
where
would
like
serve
and
prince

lost

now
the

was
natural
him
felt
contented
with

was
able
find
pleasure

his
return

having
been
joyfully
welcomed

was
sent

pleased
him
and
earned
him
commendation
from
his

during

had
been
promoted

and
when
the
regiment
was
put
war
footing
with
increase
numbers
was
again
allotted
his
old
squadron
the
campaign
began
the
regiment
was
moved
into
poland
double
pay
new
officers
arrived
new
men
and
horses
and
above
all
everybody
was
infected
with
the
merrily
excited
mood
that
goes
with
the
commencement
war
and
rostov
conscious
his
advantageous
position
the
regiment
devoted
himself
entirely
the
pleasures
and
interests
military
service
though
knew
that
sooner
later
would
have
relinquish
them
the
troops
retired
from
vilna
for
various
complicated
reasons
state
political
and
strategic
each
step
the
retreat
was
accompanied
complicated
interplay
interests
arguments
and
passions
headquarters
for
the
pavlograd
hussars
however
the
whole
this
retreat
during
the
finest
period
summer
and
with
sufficient
supplies
was
very
simple
and
agreeable
business
was
only
headquarters
that
there
was
depression
uneasiness
and
intriguing
the
body
the
army
they
did
not
ask
themselves
where
they
were
going
why
they
regretted
having
retreat
was
only
because
they
had
leave
billets
they
had
grown
accustomed
some
pretty
young
polish
lady
the
thought
that
things
looked
bad
chanced
enter
anyone
head
tried
cheerful
befits
good
soldier
and
not
think
the
general
trend
affairs
but
only
the
task
nearest
hand
first
they
camped
gaily
before
vilna
making
acquaintance
with
the
polish
landowners
preparing
for
reviews
and
being
reviewed
the
emperor
and
other
high
commanders
then
came
order
retreat
sventsyani
and
destroy
any
provisions
they
could
not
carry
away
with
them
sventsyani
was
remembered
the
hussars
only
the
drunken
camp
name
the
whole
army
gave
their
encampment
there
and
because
many
complaints
were
made
against
the
troops
who
taking
advantage
the
order
collect
provisions
took
also
horses
carriages
and
carpets
from
the
polish
proprietors
rostov
remembered
sventsyani
because
the
first
day
their
arrival
that
small
town
changed
his
sergeant
major
and
was
unable
manage
all
the
drunken
men
his
squadron
who
unknown
him
had
appropriated
five
barrels
old
beer
from
sventsyani
they
retired
farther
and
farther
drissa
and
thence
again
beyond
drissa
drawing
near
the
frontier
russia
proper
the
thirteenth
july
the
pavlograds
took
part
serious
action
for
the
first
time
the
twelfth
july
the
eve
that
action
there
was
heavy
storm
rain
and
hail
general
the
summer
was
remarkable
for
its
storms
the
two
pavlograd
squadrons
were
bivouacking
field
rye
which
was
already
ear
but
had
been
completely
trodden
down
cattle
and
horses
the
rain
was
descending
torrents
and
rostov
with
young
officer
named
ilyin
his
protege
was
sitting
hastily
constructed
shelter
officer
their
regiment
with
long
mustaches
extending
onto
his
cheeks
who
after
riding
the
staff
had
been
overtaken
the
rain
entered
rostov
shelter
have
come
from
the
staff
count
have
you
heard
raevski
exploit
and
the
officer
gave
them
details
the
saltanov
battle
which
had
heard
the
staff
rostov
smoking
his
pipe
and
turning
his
head
about
the
water
trickled
down
his
neck
listened
inattentively
with
occasional

ilyin

was
pressing
close
him
this
officer
lad
sixteen
who
had
recently
joined
the
regiment
was
now
the
same
relation
nicholas
that
nicholas
had
been
denisov
seven
years
before
ilyin
tried
imitate
rostov
everything
and
adored
him
girl
might
have
done
zdrzhinski
the
officer
with
the
long
mustache
spoke
grandiloquently
the
saltanov
dam
being
russian
thermopylae
and
how
deed
worthy
antiquity
had
been
performed
general
raevski
recounted
how
raevski
had
led
his
two
sons
onto
the
dam
under
terrific
fire
and
had
charged
with
them
beside
him
rostov
heard
the
story
and
not
only
said
nothing
encourage
zdrzhinski
enthusiasm
but
the
contrary
looked
like
man
ashamed
what
was
hearing
though
with
intention
contradicting
since
the
campaigns
austerlitz
and
rostov
knew
experience
that
men
always
lie
when
describing
military
exploits
himself
had
done
when
recounting
them
besides
that
had
experience
enough
know
that
nothing
happens
war
all
can
imagine
relate
and
did
not
like
zdrzhinski
tale
nor
did
like
zdrzhinski
himself
who
with
his
mustaches
extending
over
his
cheeks
bent
low
over
the
face
his
hearer
was
his
habit
and
crowded
rostov
the
narrow
shanty
rostov
looked
him
silence
the
first
place
there
must
have
been
such
confusion
and
crowding
the
dam
that
was
being
attacked
that
raevski
did
lead
his
sons
there
could
have
had
effect
except
perhaps
some
dozen
men
nearest
him
thought
the
rest
could
not
have
seen
how
with
whom
raevski
came
onto
the
dam
and
even
those
who
did
see
would
not
have
been
much
stimulated
for
what
had
they
with
raevski
tender
paternal
feelings
when
their
own
skins
were
danger
and
besides
the
fate
the
fatherland
did
not
depend
whether
they
took
the
saltanov
dam
not
are
told
was
the
case
thermopylae
why
should
have
made
such
sacrifice
and
why
expose
his
own
children
the
battle
would
not
have
taken
brother
petya
there
even
ilyin
who
stranger
but
nice
lad
but
would
have
tried
put
them
somewhere
under
cover
nicholas
continued
think
listened
zdrzhinski
but
did
not
express
his
thoughts
for
such
matters
too
had
gained
experience
knew
that
this
tale
redounded
the
glory
our
arms
and
one
had
pretend
not
doubt
and
acted
accordingly
can
stand
this
any
more
said
ilyin
noticing
that
rostov
did
not
relish
zdrzhinski
conversation
stockings
and
shirt
and
the
water
running
seat
and
look
for
shelter
the
rain
seems
less
heavy
ilyin
went
out
and
zdrzhinski
rode
away
five
minutes
later
ilyin
splashing
through
the
mud
came
running
back
the
shanty
hurrah
rostov
come
quick
found
about
two

yards
away

there
mary

pretty
young

the

whether
from
lack
means
because
did
not
like
part
from
his
young
wife
the
early
days
their
marriage
took
her
about
with
him
wherever
the
hussar
regiment
went
and
his
jealousy
had
become
standing
joke
among
the
hussar
officers
rostov
threw
his
cloak
over
his
shoulders
shouted
lavrushka
follow
with
the
things
and
now
slipping
the

now
splashing
right
through
set
off
with

ilyin
entering
the
room
were
welcomed
with
merry
shouts
and
laughter
dear
how
jolly
are
said
rostov
laughing
and
why
you
stand
there
gaping
what
swells
they
are
why
the
water
streams
from
them
don
make
our
drawing
room
wet

mary

cried
other
voices
rostov
and
ilyin
hastened
find
corner
where
they
could
change
into
dry
clothes
without
offending
mary
hendrikhovna
modesty
they
were
going
into
tiny
recess
behind
partition
change
but
found
completely
filled
three
officers
who
sat
playing
cards
the
light
solitary
candle
empty
box
and
these
officers
would
account
yield
their

mary
hendrikhovna
obliged
them
with
the
loan
petticoat
used
curtain
and
behind
that
screen
rostov
and
ilyin
helped
lavrushka
who
had
brought
their
kits
changed
their
wet
things
for
dry
ones
fire
was
made
the
dilapidated

was
found
fixed

and
covered
with
horsecloth
small
samovar
was
produced
and
cellaret
and
half

and
having
asked
mary

they
all
crowded
round
her
one
offered
her
clean
handkerchief
wipe
her
charming
hands
another
spread

under

little
feet
keep
them
from

another
hung
his

over
the

keep
out
the

and
yet
another
waved
the
flies
off
her
husband
face
lest
should
wake
leave
him
alone
said
mary
hendrikhovna
smiling
timidly
and
happily
sleeping
well
after
sleepless
night
mary
hendrikhovna
replied
the
officer
one
must
look
after
the
doctor
perhaps
take
pity
someday
when
comes
cutting
off
leg
arm
for
there
were
only
three
tumblers
the
water
was
muddy
that
one
could
not
make
out
whether
the
tea
was
strong
weak
and
the
samovar
held
only
six
tumblers
water
but
this

receive
one
tumbler
from
mary
hendrikhovna
plump
little
hands
with
their
short
and
not
overclean
nails
all
the
officers
appeared
and
really
were
love
with
her
that
evening
even
those
playing
cards
behind
the
partition
soon
left
their
game
and
came
over
the
samovar
yielding
the
general
mood
courting
mary
hendrikhovna
she
seeing
herself
surrounded
such
brilliant
and
polite
young
men
beamed
with
satisfaction
try
she
might
hide
and
perturbed
she
evidently
was
each
time
her
husband
moved
his
sleep
behind
her
there
was
only
one
spoon
sugar
was
more
plentiful
than
anything
else
but
took
too
long
dissolve
was
decided
that
mary
hendrikhovna
should
stir
the
sugar
for
everyone
turn
rostov
received
his
tumbler
and
adding
some
rum
asked
mary
hendrikhovna
stir
but
you
take
without
sugar
she
said
smiling
all
the
time
everything
she
said
and
everything
the
others
said
was
very
amusing
and
had
double
meaning
not
the
sugar
want
but
only
that
your
little
hand
should
stir
tea
mary
hendrikhovna
assented
and
began
looking
for
the
spoon
which
someone
meanwhile
had
pounced
use
your
finger
mary
hendrikhovna
will
still
nicer
said
rostov
too
hot
she
replied
blushing
with
pleasure
ilyin
put
few
drops
rum
into
the
bucket
water
and
brought
mary
hendrikhovna
asking
her
stir
with
her
finger
this
cup
said
only
dip
your
finger
and
drink
all
when
they
had
emptied
the
samovar
rostov
took
pack
cards
and
proposed
that
they
should
play
kings
with
mary
hendrikhovna
they
drew
lots
settle
who
should
make
her
set
rostov
suggestion
was
agreed
that
whoever
became
king
should
have
the
right
kiss
mary
hendrikhovna
hand
and
that
the
booby
should
refill
and
reheat
the
samovar
for
the
doctor
when
the
latter
awoke
well
but
supposing
mary
hendrikhovna
king
asked
ilyin
she
queen
and
her
word
law
they
had
hardly
begun
play
before
the
doctor
disheveled
head
suddenly
appeared
from
behind
mary
hendrikhovna
had
been
awake
for
some
time
listening
what
was
being
said
and
evidently
found
nothing
entertaining
amusing
what
was
going
his
face
was
sad
and
depressed
without
greeting
the
officers
scratched
himself
and
asked
allowed
pass
they
were
blocking
the
way
soon
had
left
the
room
all
the
officers
burst
into
loud
laughter
and
mary
hendrikhovna
blushed
till
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
thereby
became
still
more
attractive
them
returning
from
the
yard
the
doctor
told
his
wife
who
had
ceased
smile
happily
and
looked
him
alarm
awaiting
her
sentence
that
the
rain
had
ceased
and
they
must
sleep

gentlemen
you
have
had
your
sleep
but
have
not
slept
for
two
nights
replied
the
doctor
and
sat
down
morosely
beside
his
wife
waiting
for
the
game
end
seeing
his
gloomy
face
frowned
his
wife
the
officers
grew
still
merrier
and
some
them
could
not
refrain
from
laughter
for
which
they
hurriedly
sought
plausible
pretexts
when
had
gone
taking
his
wife
with
him
and
had
settled
down
with
her
their
covered
cart
the
officers
lay
down
the
tavern
covering
themselves
with
their
wet
cloaks
but
they
did
not
sleep
for
long
time
now
they
exchanged
remarks
recalling
the
doctor
uneasiness
and
his
wife
delight
now
they
ran
out
into
the
porch
and
reported
what
was
taking
place
the
covered
trap
several
times
rostov
covering
his
head
tried
sleep
but
some
remark
would
arouse
him
and
conversation
would
resumed
the
accompaniment
unreasoning
merry
childlike
laughter

the

again
boiled

went
off

the

when

but
not
once
the
impending
danger
formerly
when
going
into
action
rostov
had
felt
afraid
now
had
not
the
least
feeling
fear
was
fearless
not
because
had
grown
used
being
under
fire
one
cannot
grow
used
danger
but
because
had
learned
how
manage
his
thoughts
when
danger
had
grown
accustomed
when
going
into
action
think
about
anything
but
what
would
seem
most
likely
interest
him
the
impending
danger
during
the
first
period
his
service
hard
tried
and
much
reproached
himself
with
cowardice
had
not
been
able
this
but
with
time
had
come
itself
now

beside
ilyin
under

occasionally
plucking

touching

finished

behind

with
calm
and
careless

though
were
merely
out
for

glanced
with
pity
the
excited
face
ilyin
who
talked
much
and
great
agitation
knew
from
experience
the
tormenting
expectation
terror
and
death
the
cornet
was
suffering
and
knew
that
only
time
could
help
him
soon
the
sun
appeared
clear
strip

beneath
the
clouds
the
wind
fell
dared
not
spoil
the
beauty
the
summer
morning
after
the
storm
drops
still
continued
fall
but
vertically
now
and
all
was
still
the
whole
sun
appeared
the

and
disappeared
behind

narrow
cloud
that
hung
above
few
minutes
later
reappeared
brighter
still
from
behind
the

the
cloud
tearing
its
edge
everything
grew
bright
and
glittered
and
with
that
light
and

came

before

had

rostov

with

they
swooped
down
close
the

something
confused
happened
there
amid

and
five
minutes
later
our

were
galloping
back

was
one
the
first
catch

these

pursuing
our
uhlans
nearer
and
nearer
disorderly
crowds
came
the
uhlans
and
the
french
dragoons
pursuing
them
could
already
see
how
these
men
who
looked
small
the

the

jostled
and
overtook
one
another
waving
their
arms
and
their
sabers
the

rostov
gazed
what
was
happening
before
him

felt
instinctively
that
the
hussars
struck
the
french
dragoons
now
the
latter
could
not
withstand
them
but
charge
was
made
must
done
now
that
very
moment

too
late

replied
the

and
really
rostov
without
waiting

him
out
touched
his

galloped

his

and
before
had
time
finish
giving
the

the
whole

sharing
his
feeling
was
following
him
rostov
himself
did
not
know
how
why
did
acted

when
hunting
without
reflecting
considering
saw
the
dragoons
near
and
that
they
were
galloping
disorder
knew
they
could
not
withstand
attack
knew
there
was
only
that
moment
and
that
let
slip
would
not
return
the
bullets
were
whining
and
whistling
stimulatingly
around
him
and
his
horse
was
eager
that
could
not
restrain
himself
touched
his
horse
gave
the
word
command
and
immediately
hearing
behind
him
the
tramp
the
horses
his
deployed
squadron
rode
full
trot
downhill
toward
the
dragoons
hardly
had
they
reached
the
bottom
the
hill
before
their
pace
instinctively
changed
gallop
which
grew
faster
and
faster
they
drew
nearer
our
uhlans
and
the
french
dragoons
who
galloped
after
them
the
dragoons
were
now
close
hand
seeing
the
hussars
the
foremost
began
turn
while
those
behind
began
halt
with
the
same
feeling
with
which
had
galloped
across

fell
among

nearly
all
the
french

were
galloping
back
rostov
picking
out
one
gray
horse
dashed
after
him
the
way
came
upon
bush
his
gallant
horse
cleared
and
almost
before
had
righted
himself
his
saddle
saw
that
would
immediately
overtake
the
enemy
had
selected
that
frenchman
his
uniform
officer
was
going
gallop
crouching
his
gray
horse
and
urging
with
his
saber
another
moment
rostov

dashed
its
breast
against
the
hindquarters
the
officer
horse
almost
knocking
over
and
the
same
instant
rostov
without
knowing
why
raised
his
saber
and
struck
the
frenchman
with
the
instant
had
done
this
all
rostov
animation
vanished
the
officer
fell
not
much
from
the
blow
which
had
but
slightly
cut
his
arm
above
the
elbow
from
the
shock
his
horse
and
from
fright
rostov
reined
his
horse
and
his
eyes
sought
his
foe
see
whom
had
vanquished
the
french
dragoon
officer
was
hopping
with
one
foot
the
ground
the
other
being
caught
the
stirrup
his
eyes
screwed
with
fear
every
moment
expected
another
blow
gazed
rostov
with
shrinking
terror
his
pale
and
mud
stained
face
fair
and
young
with
dimple
the
chin
and
light
blue
eyes
was
not
enemy
face
all
suited
battlefield
but
most
ordinary
homelike
face
before
rostov
had
decided
what
with
him
the
officer
cried
surrender
hurriedly
but
vainly
tried
get
his
foot
out
the
stirrup
and
did
not
remove
his
frightened
blue
eyes
from
rostov
face
some
hussars
who
galloped
disengaged
his
foot
and
helped
him
into
the
saddle
all
sides
the
hussars
were
busy
with
the
dragoons
one
was
wounded
but
though
his
face
was
bleeding
would
not
give
his

another

perched
behind

the

his

something
vague
and
confused
which
could
not
all
account
for

come
over
him
with
the
capture
that
officer
and
the
blow
had
dealt
him
count
ostermann
tolstoy
met
the
returning
hussars
sent
for

thanked
him
and

his

would

him
for

when
sent
for

rostov
remembering
that
had
charged
without

felt
sure
his

was
sending
for
him
punish
him
for

ostermann
flattering
words
and
promise
reward
should
therefore
have
struck
him
all
the
more
pleasantly
but
still
felt
that

vaguely
disagreeable
feeling
moral
nausea
but
what

asked

disgraced
myself
any

that
not
something
else
resembling

tormented
him
yes
yes
that
french
officer
with
the
dimple
and
remember
how
arm
paused
when
raised
rostov
saw
the
prisoners
being
led
away
and
galloped
after
them
have
look
his
frenchman
with
the
dimple
his
chin
was
sitting
his
foreign
uniform
hussar
packhorse
and
looked
anxiously
about
him
the
sword
cut
his
arm
could
scarcely
called
wound
glanced
rostov
with
feigned
smile
and
waved
his
hand
greeting
rostov
still
had
the
same
indefinite
feeling
shame
all
that
day
and
the
next
his
friends
and
comrades
noticed
that
rostov
without
being
dull
angry
was
silent
thoughtful
and
preoccupied
drank
reluctantly
tried
remain
alone
and
kept
turning
something
over
his
mind
rostov
was
always
thinking
about
that
brilliant
exploit
his
which
his
amazement
had
gained
him
the
george
cross
and
even
given
him
reputation
for
bravery
and
there
was
something
could
not
all
understand
others
are
even
more
afraid
than
thought
that
all
there
what
called
heroism
and
did
for
country
sake
and
how
was
blame
with
his
dimple
and
blue
eyes
and
how
frightened
was
thought
that
should
kill
him
why
should
kill
him
hand
trembled
and
they
have
given
george

can
make
out
all
but
while
nicholas
was
considering
these
questions
and
still
could
reach
clear
solution
what
puzzled
him
the

his
favor

natasha
illness
was
serious
that
fortunately
for
her
and
for
her
parents
the
consideration
all
that
had
caused
the
illness
her
conduct
and
the
breaking
off
her
engagement
receded
into
the
background
she
was
ill
that
was
impossible
for
them
consider
how
far
she
was
blame
for
what
had
happened
she
could
not
eat
sleep
grew
visibly
thinner
coughed
and
the
doctors
made
them
feel
was
danger
they
could
not
think
anything
but
how
help
her
doctors
came

her
singly

talked
much
french
german
and
latin
blamed
one
another
and
prescribed
great
variety
medicines
for
all
the
diseases
known

but
the
simple

never
occurred
any

that
they
could
not

this

the
business
their
lives
was
cure
and
they
received
money
for
and
had
spent
the
best
years
their
lives
that
business
but
above
all
that
thought
was
kept
out
their
minds
the
fact
that
they
saw
they
were
really
useful

they
were
the
whole
rostov
family
their
usefulness
did
not
depend
making
the
patient
swallow
substances
for
the
most
part
harmful
the
harm
was
scarcely
perceptible
they
were
given
small
doses
but
they
were
useful
necessary
and
indispensable
because
they
satisfied
mental
need
the
invalid
and
those
who
loved
her
and
that
why
there
are
and
always
will
pseudo
healers
wise

homeopaths
and
allopaths
they
satisfied
that
eternal
human
need
for

for

that
something
should
done
which

those
who
are

had
not
known
that
was
costing
him
thousand
rubles
and
that
would

had
not

continued
would

other

how
metivier
and
feller
had
not
understood
the

but
frise
had
and

had
diagnosed
them
even
better
what
would
the

have
done
had
she
not
been
able
sometimes
scold
the

for
not
strictly
obeying
the

orders
you
never
get

that
she
would
say
forgetting
her
grief
her
vexation
you
won
obey
the

and
take
your
medicine
the
right

mustn

you

would
deriving
much
comfort
from
the
utterance
that
foreign
word
incomprehensible

well
herself
what
would

have
done
without
the
glad
consciousness
that
she
had
not
undressed
during
the
first
three
nights
order
ready
carry
out
all
the
doctor
injunctions
with
precision
and
that
she
still
kept
awake
night
not
miss
the
proper
time
when
the
slightly
harmful
pills
the
little
gilt
box
had
administered
even
natasha
herself
was
pleasant
see
that
many
sacrifices
were
being
made
for
her
sake
and
know
that
she
had
take
medicine
certain
hours
though
she
declared
that
medicine
would
cure
her
and
that
was
all
nonsense
and
was
even
pleasant
able
show
disregarding
the
orders
that
she
did
not
believe
medical
treatment
and
did
not
value
her
life
the
doctor
came
every
day
felt
her
pulse
looked
her
tongue
and
regardless
her
grief
stricken
face
joked
with
her
but
when
had
gone
into
another
room
which
the
countess
hurriedly
followed
him
assumed
grave
air
and
thoughtfully
shaking
his
head
said
that
though
there
was
danger
had
hopes
the
effect
this
last
medicine
and
one
must
wait
and
see
that
the
malady
was
chiefly
mental
but
and
the
countess
trying
conceal
the
action
from
herself
and
from
him
slipped
gold
coin
into
his
hand
and
always
returned
the
patient
with
more
tranquil
mind
the
symptoms
natasha
illness
were
that
she
ate
little
slept
little
coughed
and
was
always
low
spirited
the
doctors
said
that
she
could
not
get
without
medical
treatment
they
kept
her
the
stifling
atmosphere
the
town
and
the
rostovs
did
not
move
the
country
that
summer
spite
the
many
pills
she
swallowed
and
the
drops
and
powders
out
the
little
bottles
and
boxes
which
madame
schoss
who
was
fond
such
things
made
large
collection
and
spite
being
deprived
the
country
life
which
she
was
accustomed

prevailed
natasha
grief
began
overlaid
the
impressions
daily
life
ceased

painfully
her

gradually
faded
into

chapter

natasha
was
calmer
but
happier
she
not
merely
avoided
all
external
forms
pleasure
balls
promenades
concerts
and
theaters
but
she
never
laughed
without
sound
tears
her
laughter
she
could
not
sing
soon
she
began
laugh
tried
sing
herself
tears
choked
her
tears
remorse
tears
the
recollection
those
pure
times
which
could
never
return
tears
vexation
that
she
should
uselessly
have
ruined
her
young
life
which
might
have
been
happy
laughter
and
singing
particular
seemed
her
like
blasphemy
face
her
sorrow
without
any
need
self
restraint
wish
coquet
ever
entered
her
head
she
said
and
felt
that
time
that
man
was
more
her
than
nastasya
ivanovna
the
buffoon
something
stood
sentinel
within
her
and
forbade
her
every
joy
besides
she
had
lost
all
the
old
interests
her
carefree
girlish
life
that
had
been
full
hope
the
previous
autumn
the
hunting
uncle
and
the
christmas
holidays
spent
with
nicholas
otradnoe
were
what
she
recalled
oftenest
and
most
painfully
what
would
she
not
have
given
bring
back
even
single
day
that
time
but
was
gone
forever
her
presentiment
the
time
had
not
deceived
her
that
that
state
freedom
and
readiness
for
any
enjoyment
would
not
return
again
yet
was
necessary
live
comforted
her
reflect
that
she
was
not
better
she
had
formerly
imagined
but
worse
much
worse
than
anybody
else
the
world
but
this
was
not
enough
she
knew
that
and
asked
herself
what
next
but
there
was
nothing
come
there
was
joy
life
yet
life
was
passing
natasha
apparently
tried
not
burden
hindrance
anyone
but
wanted
nothing
for
herself
she
kept
away
from
everyone
the
house
and
felt
ease
only
with
her
brother
petya
she
liked
with
him
better
than
with
the
others
and
when
alone
with
him
she
sometimes
laughed
she
hardly
ever
left
the
house
and
those
who
came
see
them
was
glad
see
only
one
person
pierre
would
have
been
impossible
treat
her
with
more
delicacy
greater
care
and
the
same
time
more
seriously
than
did
count
bezukhov
natasha
unconsciously
felt
this
delicacy
and
found
great
pleasure
his
society
but
she
was
not
even
grateful
him
for
nothing
good
pierre
part
seemed
her
effort
seemed
natural
for
him
kind
everyone
that
there
was
merit
his
kindness
sometimes
natasha
noticed
embarrassment
and
awkwardness
his
part
her
presence
especially
when
wanted
something
please
her
feared
that
something
they
spoke
would
awaken
memories
distressing
her
she
noticed
this
and
attributed
his
general
kindness
and
shyness
which
she
imagined
must
the
same
toward
everyone
was
her
after
those
involuntary
words
that
were
free
would
have
asked
his
knees
for
her
hand
and
her
love
uttered
moment
when
she
was
strongly
agitated
pierre
never
spoke
natasha
his
feelings
and
seemed
plain
her
that
those
words
which
had
then
comforted
her
were
spoken
all
sorts
meaningless
words
are
spoken
comfort
crying
child
was
not
because
pierre
was
married
man
but
because
natasha
felt
very
strongly
with
him
that
moral
barrier
the
absence
which
she
had
experienced
with
kuragin
that
never
entered
her
head
that
the
relations
between
him
and
herself
could
lead
love
her
part
still
less
his
even
the
kind
tender
self
conscious
romantic
friendship
between
man
and
woman
which
she
had
known
several
instances
before

pay
her
devotions
the

saints
she
suggested
that
natasha
should
fast
and
prepare
for
holy
communion
and
natasha
gladly
welcomed
the
idea
despite
the
doctor
orders
that
she
should
not
out

morning
natasha
insisted
fasting
and
preparing

generally
prepared
for

agrafena

did
going

every
day
for
week
and
not
once
missing

mass
the
countess
was
pleased
with
natasha
zeal
after
the
poor
results
the
medical
treatment
the
depths
her
heart
she
hoped
that
prayer
might
help
her
daughter
more
than
medicines
and
though
not
without
fear
and
concealing
from
the
doctor
she
agreed

and
entrusted

generally
found

already

was

being

washing
and
meekly
putting
her
shabbiest
dress
and

natasha
prepared
herself
not
their

but
church
where
according
the
devout
agrafena
ivanovna
the
priest
was
man
very
severe
and
lofty
life
there
were
never
many
people
the
church
natasha
always
stood
beside
belova
the
customary
place
before
icon
the
blessed
virgin
let
into
the
screen
before
the
choir
the
left
side
and
feeling
new
her
humility
before
something
great
and
incomprehensible
seized
her
when
that
unusual
morning
hour
gazing
the
dark
face
the
virgin
illuminated
the
candles
burning
before
and
the
morning
light
falling
from
the
window
she
listened
the
words
the
service
which
she
tried
follow
with
understanding
when
she
understood
them
her
personal
feeling
became
interwoven
the
prayers
with
shades
its
own
when
she
did
not
understand
was
sweeter
still
think
that
the
wish
understand
everything
pride
that
impossible

all
that
only
necessary

commit

god
whom
she
felt
guiding
her
soul
those
moments
she
crossed
herself
bowed
low
and
when
she
did
not
understand
horror
her
own
vileness
simply
asked
god
forgive
her
everything
everything
have
mercy
upon
her
the
prayers
which
she
surrendered
herself
most
all
were
those

her
way
home

hour
when
she
met
one
but
bricklayers
going
work
men
sweeping
the
street
and
everybody
within
the
houses
was
still
asleep
natasha
experienced
feeling
new
her
sense
the
possibility
correcting
her
faults
the
possibility
new
clean
life
and
happiness
during
the
whole
week
she
spent
this
way
that
feeling
grew
every
day
and
the
happiness
taking
communion
communing
agrafena
ivanovna
joyously
playing
with
the
word
called
seemed
natasha
great
that
she
felt
she
should
never
live
till
that
blessed
sunday
but
the
happy
day
came
and
that
memorable
sunday
when
dressed
white
muslin
she
returned
home
after
communion
for
the
first
time
for
many
months
she
felt
calm
and
not
oppressed
the
thought
the
life
that
lay
before
her
the
doctor
who
came
see
her
that
day
ordered
her
continue
the
powders
had
prescribed
fortnight
previously
she
must

taking
them

sincerely
satisfied
with
his
success

playfully
adroitly
took
the
gold
coin

palm
she
will
soon
singing
and
frolicking
about
the
last
medicine
has
done
her
very
great
deal
good
she
has
freshened
very
much
the
countess
with
cheerful
expression
her
face
looked
down
her
nails
and
spat
little
for
luck
she
returned

and

that

natasha
her

side
passed
through
the
crowd
behind
liveried
footman
who
cleared
the
way
for
them
she
heard
young
man
speaking
about
her
too
loud
whisper
that
rostova
the
one
who
she
much
thinner
but
all
the
same
she
pretty
she
heard
thought
she
heard
the
names
kuragin
and
bolkonski
but
she
was
always
imagining
that
always
seemed
her
that
everyone
who
looked
her
was
thinking
only
what
had
happened
her
with
sinking
heart
wretched
she
always
was
now
when
she
found
herself

natasha
her

trimmed
with
black

walked
women
can
walk
with
the
more
repose
and
stateliness
the
greater
the
pain
and
shame
her
soul
she
knew
for
certain
that
she
was
pretty
but
this
longer
gave
her
satisfaction
used
the
contrary
tormented
her
more
than
anything
else
late
and
particularly
this
bright
hot
summer
day
town
sunday
again
another
week
past
she
thought
recalling
that
she
had
been
here
the
sunday
before
and
always
the
same
life
that
life
and
the
same
surroundings
which
used
easy
live
pretty
young
and
know
that
now
good
used
bad
but
now
know
good
she
thought
but
yet
best
years
are
slipping
and
are
good
anyone
she
stood
her
mother
side
and
exchanged
nods
with
acquaintances
near
her
from
habit
she
scrutinized
the
ladies
dresses
condemned
the
bearing
lady
standing
close
who
was
not
crossing
herself
properly
but
cramped
manner
and
again
she
thought
with
vexation
that
she
was
herself
being
judged
and
was
judging
others
and
suddenly
the
sound
the
service
she
felt
horrified
her
own
vileness
horrified
that
the
former
purity
her
soul
was
again
lost
her
comely
fresh
looking
old
man
was
conducting
the
service
with
that
mild
solemnity
which
has
elevating
and
soothing
effect
the
souls
the
worshipers
the
gates
the
sanctuary
screen
were
closed
the
curtain
was
slowly

pleaded
the
deacon
came
out
onto
the
raised
space
before
the
altar
screen
and
holding
his
thumb
extended
drew
his
long
hair
from
under
his
dalmatic
and
making
the
sign
the

his
breast
began
loud
and
solemn
voice
recite

for

for
the

angels
and
all
the
spirits
who

prayed
natasha
when
they
prayed
for
the
warriors
she
thought
her
brother
and
denisov
when
they
prayed
for
all
traveling
land
and
sea
she
remembered
prince
andrew
prayed
for
him
and
asked
god
forgive
her
all
the
wrongs
she
had
done
him
when
they
prayed
for
those
who
love
she
prayed
for
the
members
her
own
family
her
father
and
mother
and
sonya
realizing
for
the
first
time
how
wrongly
she
had
acted
toward
them
and
feeling
all
the
strength
her
love
for
them
when
they
prayed
for
those
who
hate
she
tried
think
her
enemies
and
people
who
hated
her
order
pray
for
them
she
included
among
her
enemies
the
creditors
and
all
who
had
business
dealings
with
her

and
always
the
thought
enemies
and
those
who
hated
her
she
remembered
anatole
who
had
done
her
much
harm
and
though
did
not
hate
her
she
gladly
prayed
for
him
for
enemy
only
prayer
did
she
feel
able
think
clearly
and
calmly
prince
andrew
and
anatole
men
for
whom
her
feelings
were
nothing
compared
with
her
awe
and
devotion
god
when
they
prayed
for
the
imperial
family
and
the
synod
she
bowed
very
low
and
made
the
sign
the
cross
saying
herself
that
even
she
did
not
understand
still
she
could
not
doubt
and
any
rate
loved
the
governing
synod
and
prayed
for
when
had
finished
the
litany
the
deacon
crossed
the
stole
over
his
breast
and
said

commit
ourselves
and
our
whole

prayed
natasha
with
impatient
emotion
her
heart
not
crossing
herself
but
letting
her
slender
arms
hang
down
expecting
some
invisible
power
any
moment
take
her
and
deliver
her
from
herself
from
her
regrets
desires
remorse
hopes
and
sins
the
countess
looked
round
several
times
her
daughter
softened
face
and
shining
eyes
and
prayed
god
help
her
unexpectedly
the
middle
the
service
and
not
the
usual
order
natasha
knew
well
the
deacon
brought
out

placed
before

the

out
with

knelt
down
with
effort
everybody
followed
his

they

amen
natasha
receptive
condition
soul
this
prayer
affected
her
strongly
she
listened
every
word
about
the
victory
moses
over
amalek
gideon
over
midian
and
david
over
goliath
and
about
the
destruction
thy
jerusalem
and
she
prayed
god
with
the
tenderness
and
emotion
with
which
her
heart
was
overflowing
but
without
fully
understanding
what
she
was
asking
god
that
prayer
she
shared
with
all
her
heart
the
prayer
for
the
spirit
righteousness
for
the
strengthening
the
heart
faith
and
hope
and
its
animation
love
but
she
could
not
pray
that
her
enemies
might
trampled
under
foot
when
but
few
minutes
before
she
had
been
wishing
she
had
more
them
that
she
might
pray
for
them
but
neither
could
she
doubt
the
righteousness
the
prayer
that
was
being
read
bended
knees
she
felt
her
heart
devout
and
tremulous
awe
the
thought
the
punishment
that
overtakes
men
for
their
sins
and
especially
her
own
sins
and
she
prayed
god
forgive
them
all
and
her
too
and
give
them
all
and
her
too
peace
and
happiness
and
seemed
her
that
god
heard
her
prayer
chapter
xix
from
the
day
when
pierre
after
leaving
the
rostovs
with
natasha
grateful
look
fresh
his
mind
had
gazed
the
comet
that
seemed
fixed
the
sky
and
felt
that
something
new
was
appearing
his
own
horizon
from
that
day
the
problem
the
vanity
and
uselessness
all
earthly
things
that
had
incessantly
tormented
him
longer
presented
itself
that
terrible
question
why
wherefore
which
had
come
him
amid
every
occupation
was
now
replaced
not
another
question
reply
the
former
question
but
her
image
when
listened
himself
took
part
trivial
conversations
when
read
heard
human
baseness
folly
was
not
horrified
formerly
and
did
not
ask
himself
why
men
struggled
about
these
things
when
all
transient
and
incomprehensible
but
remembered
her
had
last
seen
her
and
all
his
doubts
vanished
not
because
she
had
answered
the
questions
that
had
haunted
him
but
because
his
conception
her
transferred
him
instantly
another
brighter
realm
spiritual
activity
which
one
could
justified
guilty
realm
beauty
and
love
which
was
worth
living
for
whatever
worldly
baseness
presented
itself
him
said
himself
well
supposing
swindled
the
country
and
the
tsar
and
the
country
and
the
tsar
confer
honors
upon
him
what
does
that
matter
she
smiled
yesterday
and
asked
come
again
and
love
her
and
one
will
ever
know
and
his
soul
felt
calm
and
peaceful
pierre
still
went
into
society
drank
much
and
led
the
same
idle
and
dissipated
life
because
besides
the
hours
spent
the
rostovs
there
were
other
hours
had
spend
somehow
and
the
habits
and
acquaintances
had
made
moscow
formed
current
that
bore
him
along
irresistibly
but
latterly
when
more
and
more
disquieting
reports
came
from
the
seat
war
and
natasha
health
began
improve
and
she
longer
aroused
him
the
former
feeling
careful
pity
ever
increasing
restlessness
which
could
not
explain
took
possession
him
felt
that
the
condition
was
could
not
continue
long
that
catastrophe
was
coming
which
would
change
his
whole
life
and
impatiently
sought
everywhere
for
signs
that
approaching
catastrophe
one
his
brother
masons
had
revealed
pierre
the
following
prophecy
concerning
napoleon
drawn
from
the
revelation
john
chapter
verse
the
apocalypse
said
here
wisdom
let
him
that
hath
understanding
count
the
number
the
beast
for
the
number
man
and
his
number
six
hundred
threescore
and
six
and
the
fifth
verse
the
same
chapter
and
there
was
given
unto
him
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
blasphemies
and
power
was
given
unto
him
continue
forty
and
two
months
the
french
alphabet
written
out
with
the
same
numerical
values
the
hebrew
which
the
first
nine
letters
denote
units
and
the
others
tens
will
have
the
following
significance
writing
the
words
empereur
napoleon
numbers
appears
that
the
sum
them
and
that
napoleon
was
therefore
the
beast
foretold
the
apocalypse
moreover
applying
the
same
system
the
words
quarante
deux
which
was
the
term
allowed
the
beast
that
spoke
great
things
and
blasphemies
the
same
number
was
obtained
from
which
followed
that
the
limit
fixed
for
napoleon
power
had
come
the
year
when
the
french
emperor
was
forty
two
this
prophecy
pleased
pierre
very
much
and
often
asked
himself
what
would
put
end
the
power
the
beast
that
napoleon
and
tried
the
same
system
using
letters
numbers
and
adding
them
find
answer
the
question
that
engrossed
him
wrote
the
words
empereur
alexandre
nation
russe
and
added
their
numbers
but
the
sums
were
either
more
less
than
once
when
making
such
calculations
wrote
down
his
own
name
french
comte
pierre
besouhoff
but
the
sum
the
numbers
did
not
come
right
then
changed
the
spelling
substituting
for
the
and
adding
and
the
article
still
without
obtaining
the
desired
result
then
occurred
him
the
answer
the
question
were
contained
his
name
his
nationality
would
also
given
the
answer
wrote
russe
besuhof
and
adding
the
numbers
got
this
was
only
five
too
much
and
five
was
represented
the
very
letter
elided
from
the
article
before
the
word
empereur
omitting
the
though
incorrectly
pierre
got
the
answer
sought
russe
besuhof
made
this
discovery
excited
him
how
what
means
was
connected
with
the
great
event
foretold
the
apocalypse
did
not
know
but
did
not
doubt
that
connection
for
moment
his
love
for
natasha
antichrist
napoleon
the
invasion
the
comet
empereur
napoleon
and
russe
besuhof
all
this
had
mature
and
culminate
lift
him
out
that
spellbound
petty
sphere
moscow
habits
which
felt
himself
held
captive
and
lead
him
great
achievement
and
great
happiness
forty
two
the
eve
the
sunday
when
the
special
prayer
was
read
pierre
had
promised
the
rostovs
bring
them
from
count
rostopchin
whom
knew
well
both
the
appeal
the
people
and
the
news
from
the
army
the
morning
when
went
call
rostopchin
met
there
courier
fresh
from
the
army
acquaintance
his
own
who
often
danced
moscow
balls
please
for
heaven
sake
relieve
something
said
the
courier
have
sackful
letters
parents
among
these
letters
was
one
from
nicholas
rostov
his
father
pierre
took
that
letter
and
rostopchin
also
gave
him
the
emperor
appeal
moscow
which
had
just
been
printed
the
last
army
orders
and
his
own
most
recent
bulletin
glancing
through
the
army
orders
pierre
found
one
them
the
lists
killed
wounded
and
rewarded
the
name
nicholas
rostov
awarded
george
cross
the
fourth
class
for
courage
shown
the
ostrovna
affair
and
the
same
order
the
name
prince
andrew
bolkonski
appointed
the
command
regiment
chasseurs
though
did
not
want
remind
the
rostovs
bolkonski
pierre
could
not
refrain
from
making
them
happy
the
news
their
son
having
received
decoration
sent
that
printed
army
order
and
nicholas
letter
the
rostovs
keeping
the
appeal
the
bulletin
and
the
other
orders
take
with
him
when
went
dinner
his
conversation
with
count
rostopchin
and
the
latter
tone
anxious
hurry
the
meeting
with
the
courier
who
talked
casually
how
badly
things
were
going
the
army
the
rumors
the
discovery
spies
moscow
and
leaflet
circulation
stating
that
napoleon
promised
both
the
russian
capitals
the
autumn
and
the
talk
the
emperor
being
expected
arrive
next
day
all
aroused
with
fresh
force
that
feeling
agitation
and
expectation
pierre
which
had
been
conscious
ever
since
the
appearance
the
comet
and
especially
since
the
beginning
the
war
had
long
been
thinking
entering
the
army
and
would
have
done
had
not
been
hindered
first
his
membership
the
society
freemasons
which
was
bound
oath
and
which
preached
perpetual
peace
and
the
abolition
war
and
secondly
the
fact
that
when
saw
the
great
mass
muscovites
who
had
donned
uniform
and
were
talking
patriotism
somehow
felt
ashamed
take
the
step
but
the
chief
reason
for
not
carrying
out
his
intention
enter
the
army
lay
the
vague
idea
that
was
russe
besuhof
who
had
the
number
the
beast
that
his
part
the
great
affair
setting
limit
the
power
the
beast
that
spoke
great
and
blasphemous
things
had
been
predestined
from
eternity
and
that
therefore
ought
not
undertake
anything
but
wait
for
what
was
bound
come
pass
chapter
few
intimate
friends
were
dining
with
the
rostovs
that
day

strong

carried
his
bulk
with
evident
ease
went
the
stairs
puffing
and
muttering
something
his
coachman
did
not
even
ask
whether

knew
that
when
his
master

cloak
heard
her

was
practicing
solfa
exercises
the
music

that
she
had
not
sung
since
her

and
the
sound
her

surprised
and
delighted

softly
and
saw
her
the
lilac
dress
she
had
worn
church
walking
about
the
room
singing
she
had
her
back
him
when
opened
the
door
but
when
turning
quickly
she
saw
his
broad
surprised
face
she
blushed
and
came
rapidly

she
said
adding
way

the
old
animation

said
blushing
and
fixing
her
eyes
inquiringly
him
why

quickly

disapproved

don
know
how
important
you
are
how
much

for
she
spoke
rapidly
and
did
not
notice
how
pierre
flushed
her
words
saw
that
same
army
order
that
bolkonski
she
whispered
the
name

knees
for

hand
and
the
same
feeling
pity
tenderness
and
love
took
possession
him
and
the
same
words
rose
his
lips
but
she
did
not
give
him

her
music
before
her

the
hand
the
countess

the

silent
and
preoccupied
all
through

seeming

and
yet
everything
strange
strange

very
far
from
having
military
tastes
but
these
times
one
can
answer
for
himself
after
dinner
the
count
settled
himself
comfortably
easy
chair
and
with
serious
face
asked
sonya

with
closed
eyes
heaving
abrupt
sighs
certain
passages
natasha
sat
erect
gazing
with
searching
look
now
her
father
and
now
pierre
pierre
felt
her
eyes
him
and
tried
not

round
the
countess
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
and
angrily
every
solemn
expression
the
manifesto
all
these
words
she
saw
only
that
the
danger
threatening
her
son
would
not
soon
over
shinshin
with
sarcastic
smile
his
lips
was
evidently
preparing
make
fun
anything
that
gave
him
the
opportunity
sonya
reading
any
remark
the
count
even
the
manifesto
itself
should
better
pretext
present
itself
after
reading
about
the
dangers
that
threatened
russia
the
hopes
the
emperor
placed
moscow
and
especially
its
illustrious
nobility
sonya
with
quiver
her

due

that

cried
the
count
opening

moist
eyes
and
sniffing
repeatedly
strong
vinaigrette

been
held
his
nose
and
added
let
the
emperor
but
say
the
word
and
sacrifice
everything
and
begrudge
nothing

shinshin
had
time
utter
the
joke

natasha
jumped
from
her
place
and
ran
her

her
better
spirits

all
not

but
did
you
notice

said
pierre
never
mind
what
for
this
moment
petya
whom
nobody
was
paying
any
attention
came
his
father
with
very
flushed
face
and
said
his
breaking
voice
that
was
now
deep
and
now
shrill
well
papa

mamma
too

clasped
her
hands
and
turned
angrily
her
husband
that

she
but
the

already

from
his
excitement
come

words

yourself
that

the
count
with
glance
his
wife
who
had
turned
pale
and
was
staring
fixedly
her
son
and
tell
you

kirilych

and
the
count
moved
out
the
room
taking
the
papers
probably
reread
them
his
study
before
having
nap
well
peter
kirilych
let
and
have
smoke
said
pierre
was
agitated
and
undecided
natasha
unwontedly
brilliant
eyes
continually
glancing
him
with
more
than
cordial
look
had
reduced
him
this
condition
think
home
home
why
you
meant
spend
the
evening
with
you
don
often
come
nowadays
and
this
girl
mine
said
the
count
good
naturedly
pointing
natasha
only
brightens
when
you
here
yes
had
forgotten
really
must
home
business
said
pierre
hurriedly
well
then
revoir
said
the
count
and
went
out
the
room
why
are
you
going
why
are
you
upset
asked
natasha
and
she
looked
challengingly
into
pierre
eyes
because
love
you
was
what
wanted
say
but
did
not
say
and
only
blushed
till
the
tears
came
and
lowered
his
eyes
because
better
for
come
less
often
because
simply
have
business
why
tell
natasha
began
resolutely
and
suddenly
stopped
they
looked
each
other
with
dismayed
and
embarrassed
faces
tried
smile
but
could
not
his
smile
expressed
suffering
and
silently
kissed
her
hand
and
went
out
pierre
made
his
mind
not
the
rostovs
any
more
chapter
xxi
after
the
definite
refusal
had
received
petya
went
his
room
and
there
locked
himself
and
wept
bitterly
when
came
tea
silent
morose
and
with
tear
stained
face
everybody
pretended
not
notice
anything
next
day
the
emperor
arrived
moscow
and
several
the
rostovs
domestic
serfs
begged
permission
have
look
him
that
morning
petya
was
long
time
dressing
and
arranging
his
hair
and
collar
look
like
grown
man
frowned
before
his
looking
glass
gesticulated
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
finally
without
saying
word
anyone
took
his
cap
and
left
the
house
the
back
door
trying
avoid
notice
petya
decided
straight
where
the
emperor
was
and
explain
frankly
some
gentleman
waiting
imagined
the
emperor
always
surrounded
gentlemen
waiting
that
count
rostov
spite
his
youth
wished
serve
his
country
that
youth
could
hindrance
loyalty
and
that
was
ready
while
dressing
petya
had
prepared
many
fine
things
meant
say
the
gentleman
waiting
was
the
very
fact
being
young
that
petya
counted
for
success
reaching
the
emperor
even
thought
how
surprised
everyone
would
his
youthfulness
and
yet
the
arrangement
his
collar
and
hair
and
his
sedate
deliberate
walk
wished
appear
grown
man
but
the
farther
went
and
the
more
his
attention
was
diverted
the
ever
increasing
crowds
moving
toward
the
kremlin
the
less
remembered
walk
with
the
sedateness
and
deliberation
man
approached
the
kremlin
even
began
avoid
being
crushed
and
resolutely
stuck
out
his
elbows
menacing
way
but
within
the
trinity
gateway
was
pressed
the
wall
people
who
probably
were
unaware
the
patriotic
intentions
with
which
had
come
that
spite
all
his
determination
had
give
and
stop
while
carriages
passed
rumbling
beneath
the
archway
beside
petya
stood
peasant
woman
footman
two
tradesmen
and
discharged
soldier
after
standing
some
time
the
gateway
petya
tried
move
forward
front
the
others
without
waiting
for
all
the
carriages
pass
and
began
resolutely
working
his
way
with
his
elbows
but
the
woman
just
front
him
who
was
the
first
against
whom
directed
his
efforts
angrily
shouted
him
what
are
you
shoving
for
young
lordling
don
you
see
all
standing
still
then
why
push
anybody
can
shove
said
the
footman
and
also
began
working
his
elbows
such
effect
that
pushed
petya
into
very
filthy
corner
the
gateway
petya
wiped
his
perspiring
face
with
his
hands
and
pulled
the
damp
collar
which
had
arranged
well
home
seem
like
man
felt
that
longer
looked
presentable
and
feared
that
were
now
approach
the
gentlemen
waiting
that
plight
would
not
admitted
the
emperor
but
was
impossible
smarten
oneself
move
another
place
because
the
crowd
one
the
generals
who
drove
past
was
acquaintance
the
rostovs
and
petya
thought
asking
his
help
but
came
the
conclusion
that
that
would
not
manly
thing
when
the
carriages
had
all
passed
the
crowd
carrying
petya
with
streamed
forward
into
the
kremlin
square
which
was
already
full
people
there
were
people
not
only
the
square
but
everywhere
the
slopes
and
the
roofs
soon
petya
found
himself
the
square
clearly
heard
the
sound
bells
and
the
joyous
voices
the
crowd
that
filled
the
whole
kremlin
for
while
the
crowd
was
less
dense
but
suddenly
all
heads
were
bared
and
everyone
rushed
forward
one
direction
petya
was
being
pressed
that
could
scarcely
breathe
and
everybody
shouted
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
petya
stood
tiptoe
and
pushed
and
pinched
but
could
see
nothing
except
the
people
about
him
all
the
faces
bore
the
same
expression
excitement
and
enthusiasm
tradesman
wife
standing
beside
petya
sobbed
and
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
father
angel
dear
one
she
kept
repeating
wiping
away
her
tears
with
her
fingers
hurrah
was
heard
all
sides
for
moment
the
crowd
stood
still
but
then
made
another
rush
forward
quite
beside
himself
petya
clinching
his
teeth
and
rolling
his
eyes
ferociously
pushed
forward
elbowing
his
way
and
shouting
hurrah
were
prepared
that
instant
kill
himself
and
everyone
else
but
both
sides
him
other
people
with
similarly
ferocious
faces
pushed
forward
and
everybody
shouted
hurrah
this
what
the
emperor
thought
petya
can
petition
him
myself
that
would
too
bold
but
spite
this
continued
struggle
desperately
forward
and
from
between
the
backs
those
front
caught
glimpses
open
space
with
strip
red
cloth
spread
out
but
just
then
the
crowd
swayed
back
the
police
front
were
pushing
back
those
who
had
pressed
too
close
the
procession
the
emperor
was
passing
from
the
palace
the
cathedral
the
assumption
and
petya
unexpectedly
received
such
blow
his
side
and
ribs
and
was
squeezed
hard
that
suddenly
everything
grew
dim
before
his
eyes
and
lost
consciousness
when
came
himself
man
clerical

with
tuft
gray
hair

back

head
and
wearing
shabby
blue
cassock
probably
church

holding
him
under
the
arm
with
one
hand
while
warding
off
the
pressure
the
crowd
with
the
other

crushed
the
young
gentleman
said
the
clerk
what

gently
they
crushed

him
the
emperor
entered
the
cathedral
the
assumption
the
crowd
spread
out
again
more
evenly
and
the
clerk
led
petya
pale
and
breathless
the
tsar
cannon
several
people
were
sorry
for
petya
and
suddenly
crowd
turned
toward
him
and
pressed
round
him
those
who
stood
nearest
him
attended
him
unbuttoned
his
coat
seated
him
the
raised
platform
the
cannon
and
reproached
those
others
whoever
they
might
who
had
crushed
him
one
might
easily
get
killed
that
way
what
they
mean
killing
people
poor
dear
white
sheet
various
voices
were
heard
saying
petya
soon
came
himself
the
color
returned
his
face
the
pain
had
passed
and
the
cost
that
temporary
unpleasantness
had
obtained
place
the
cannon
from
where
hoped
see
the
emperor
who
would
returning
that
way
petya
longer
thought
presenting
his
petition
could
only
see
the
emperor
would

while
the

was
proceeding

and
thanksgiving
for
the
conclusion

with
the
turks
the
crowd
outside
spread
out
and
hawkers
appeared
selling
kvas
gingerbread
and
poppyseed
sweets
which
petya
was
particularly
fond
and
ordinary
conversation
could
again
heard
tradesman
wife
was
showing
rent
her
shawl
and
telling
how
much
the
shawl
had
cost
another
was
saying
that
all
silk

the
clerk
who
had
rescued

talking
functionary
about
the

who
were
officiating
that
day
with
the
bishop
the
clerk
several
times
used
the
word

the
service

petya
did
not
understand
two
young
citizens
were
joking
with
some
serf
girls
who
were
cracking
nuts
all
these
conversations
especially
the
joking
with
the
girls
were
such
might
have
had
particular
charm
for
petya
his
age
but
they
did
not
interest
him
now
sat
his
elevation
the
pedestal
the
cannon
still
agitated
before
the
thought
the
emperor
and
his
love
for
him
the
feeling
pain
and
fear
had
experienced
when
was
being
crushed
together
with
that
rapture
still
further
intensified
his
sense
the
importance
the
occasion
suddenly
the
sound
firing
cannon
was
heard
from
the
embankment
celebrate
the
signing
peace
with
the
turks
and
the
crowd
rushed
impetuously
toward
the
embankment
watch
the
firing
petya
too
would
have
run
there
but
the
clerk
who
had
taken
the
young
gentleman
under
his
protection
stopped
him
the
firing
was
still
proceeding
when
officers
generals
and
gentlemen

two
days
later
the
fifteenth
july
immense
number
carriages
were
standing
outside
the
sloboda
palace
the
great
halls
were
full
the
first
were
the

and

their

full
skirted

the

there
was
incessant
movement
and
buzz
voices
the
chief
magnates
sat
high
backed
chairs
large
table
under
the
portrait
the

but
most
the
gentry
were
strolling
about
the
room
all
these
nobles
whom
pierre
met
every
day
the
club
their
own
houses
were
uniform
some
that
catherine
day
others
that
emperor
paul
others
again
the
new
uniforms
alexander
time
the
ordinary
uniform
the
nobility
and
the
general
characteristic
being
uniform
imparted
something
strange
and
fantastic
these
diverse
and
familiar
personalities
both
old
and
young
the
old
men
dim
eyed
toothless
bald
sallow
and
bloated
gaunt
and
wrinkled
were
especially
striking
for
the
most
part
they
sat
quietly
their
places
and
were
silent
they
walked
about
and
talked
attached
themselves
someone
younger
all
these
faces
the
faces
the
crowd
petya
had
seen
the

there
was
striking
contradiction
the

solemn

and
the

time
the

and
pierre
was
there
too
buttoned
since
early
morning
nobleman

that
had
become
too
tight
for
him
was
agitated
this
extraordinary
gathering
not
only
nobles
but
also
the
merchant
class
les

generaux
states
general
evoked
him
whole
series
ideas
had
long
laid
aside
but
which
were
deeply
graven
his
soul
thoughts
the
contrat
social
and
the
french
revolution
the
words
that
had
struck
him
the
emperor
appeal
that
the
sovereign
was
coming
the
capital
for
consultation
with
his
people
strengthened
this
idea
and
imagining
that
this
direction
something
important
which
had
long
awaited
was
drawing
near
strolled
about
watching
and
listening
conversations
but
nowhere
finding
any
confirmation
the
ideas
that
occupied
him
the
emperor
manifesto
was
read
evoking
enthusiasm
and
then
all
moved
about
discussing
besides
the
ordinary
topics
conversation
pierre
heard
questions
where
the
marshals
the
nobility
were
stand
when
the
emperor
entered
when
ball
should
given
the
emperor
honor
whether
they
should
group
themselves
districts
whole
provinces
and
but
soon
the
war
was
touched
what
the
nobility
had
been
convened
for
the
talk
became
undecided
and
indefinite
then
all
preferred
listening
speaking
middle
aged
man
handsome
and
virile
the
uniform
retired
naval
officer
was
speaking
one
the
rooms
and
small
crowd
was
pressing
round
him
pierre
went
the
circle
that
had
formed
round
the
speaker
and
listened
count
ilya
rostov
military
uniform
catherine
time
was
sauntering
with
pleasant
smile
among
the
crowd
with
all
whom
was
acquainted
too
approached
that
group
and
listened
with
kindly
smile
and
nods
approval
always
did
what
the
speaker
was
saying
the
retired
naval
man
was
speaking
very
boldly
was
evident
from
the
expression
the
faces
the
listeners
and
from
the
fact
that
some
people
pierre
knew
the
meekest
and
quietest
men
walked
away
disapprovingly
expressed
disagreement
with
him
pierre
pushed
his
way
into
the
middle
the
group
listened
and
convinced
himself
that
the
man
was
indeed
liberal
but
views
quite
different
from
his
own
the
naval
officer
spoke
particularly
sonorous
musical
and
aristocratic
baritone
voice
pleasantly
swallowing
his
and
generally
slurring
his
consonants
the
voice

calling
out
his

added
the

with
animation
count
rostov
mouth
watered
with
pleasure
and
nudged
pierre
but
pierre
wanted
speak
himself
pushed
forward
feeling
stirred
but
not
yet
sure
what
stirred
him
what
would
say
scarcely
had
opened
his
mouth
when
one
the
senators
man
without
tooth
his
head
with
shrewd
though
angry
expression
standing
near
the
first
speaker
interrupted
him
evidently
accustomed
managing
debates
and
maintaining
argument
began
low
but
distinct
tones
imagine
sir
said
mumbling
with
his
toothless
mouth
that
have
been
summoned
here
not
discuss
whether
best
for
the
empire
the
present
moment
adopt
conscription
call
out
the
militia
have
been
summoned
reply
the
appeal
with
which
our
sovereign
the
emperor
has
honored
but
judge
what
best
conscription
the
militia
can
leave
the
supreme
authority
pierre
suddenly
saw
outlet
for
his
excitement
hardened
his
heart
against
the
senator
who
was
introducing
this
set
and
narrow
attitude
into
the
deliberations
the
nobility
pierre
stepped
forward
and
interrupted
him
himself
did
not
yet
know
what
would
say
but
began
speak
eagerly
occasionally
lapsing
into
french
expressing
himself
bookish
russian
excuse
your
excellency
began
was
well
acquainted
with
the
senator
but
thought
necessary
this
occasion
address
him
formally
though
don
agree
with
the
gentleman
hesitated
wished
say
mon
tres
honorable
preopinant
very
honorable
opponent
with
the
gentleman
whom
have
not
the
honor
knowing
suppose
that
the
nobility
have
been
summoned
not
merely
express
their
sympathy
and
enthusiasm
but
also
consider
the
means
which
can
assist
our
fatherland
imagine
went
warming
his
subject
that
the
emperor
himself
would
not
satisfied
find
merely
owners
serfs
whom
are
willing
devote
his
service
and
chair
canon
are
ready
make
ourselves
and
not
obtain
from
any
counsel
food
for
cannon
many
persons
withdrew
from
the
circle
noticing
the
senator
sarcastic
smile
and
the
freedom
pierre
remarks
only
count
rostov
was
pleased
with
them
had
been
pleased
with
those
the
naval
officer
the
senator
and
general
with
whatever
speech
had
last
heard
think
that
before
discussing
these
questions
pierre
continued
should
ask
the
emperor
most
respectfully
ask
his
majesty
let
know
the
number
our
troops
and
the
position
which
our
army
and
our
forces
now
are
and
then
but
scarcely
had
pierre
uttered
these
words
before
was
attacked
from
three
sides
the
most
vigorous
attack
came
from
old
acquaintance
boston
player
who
had
always
been
well
disposed
toward
him
stepan
stepanovich
adraksin
adraksin
was
uniform
and
whether
result
the
uniform
from
some
other
cause
pierre
saw
before
him
quite
different
man
with
sudden
expression
malevolence
his
aged
face
adraksin
shouted
pierre
the
first
place
tell
you
have
right
question
the
emperor
about
that
and
secondly
the
russian
nobility
had
that
right
the
emperor
could
not
answer
such
question
the
troops
are
moved
according
the
enemy
movements
and
the
number
men
increases
and
decreases
another
voice
that
nobleman
medium
height
and
about
forty
years
age
whom
pierre
had
formerly
met
the
gypsies
and
knew
bad
cardplayer
and
who
also
transformed
his
uniform

pierre
wished

but
could
not
get
word
felt
that
his
words
apart
from
what
meaning
they
conveyed
were
less
audible
than
the
sound
his
opponent

the
crowd
was
expressing

several
persons
briskly
turning

the

unable

many
voices
shouted
and
talked
the

time
that
count
rostov
had
not
time
signify
his
approval
them
all
and
the
group
increased
dispersed
formed
and
then
moved
with
hum
talk
into
the
largest
hall
and
the
big
table
not
only
was
pierre
attempt
speak
unsuccessful
but
was
rudely
interrupted
pushed
aside
and
people
turned
away
from
him
from
common
enemy
this
happened
not
because
they
were
displeased
the
substance
his
speech
which
had
even
been
forgotten
after
the
many
subsequent
speeches
but
animate
the

needed
tangible
object
love
and
tangible
object
hate
pierre
became
the
latter
many
other
orators
spoke
after
the
excited
nobleman
and
all
the

spoke
eloquently
and
with

pierre
knew

and
turned
look
first

and
then
another
and
their
faces
for
the

part
only
expressed
the
fact
that
they
found
very
hot

however
felt
excited
and
the
general
desire
show
that
they
were

which
found
expression
the

more
than
the

not

trembling
voice
when
pierre
saw
the
emperor
was
coming
out
accompanied
two
merchants
one
whom
pierre
knew
fat
otkupshchik
the
other
was
the
mayor
man
with
thin
sallow
face
and
narrow
beard
both
were
weeping
tears
filled
the
thin
man
eyes
and
the
fat
otkupshchik
sobbed
outright
like
child
and
kept
repeating
our
lives
and
property
take
them
your
majesty
pierre
one
feeling
the
moment
was
desire
show
that
was
ready
all
lengths
and
was
prepared
sacrifice
everything
now
felt
ashamed
his
speech
with
its
constitutional
tendency
and
sought
opportunity
effacing
having
heard
that
count
mamonov
was
furnishing
regiment
bezukhov
once
informed
rostopchin
that
would
give
thousand
men
and
their
maintenance
old
rostov
could
not
tell
his
wife
what
had
passed
without
tears
and
once
consented
petya
request
and
went
himself
enter
his
name
next
day
the
emperor
left
moscow
the
assembled
nobles
all
took
off
their
uniforms
and
settled
down
again
their
homes
and
clubs
and
not
without
some
groans
gave
orders
their
stewards
about
the
enrollment
feeling
amazed
themselves
what
they
had
done
book
ten
chapter
napoleon
began
the
war
with
russia
because
could
not
resist
going
dresden
could
not
help
having
his
head
turned
the
homage
received
could
not
help
donning
polish
uniform
and
yielding
the
stimulating
influence
june
morning
and
could
not
refrain
from
bursts
anger
the
presence
kurakin
and
then
balashev
alexander
refused
negotiations
because
felt
himself
personally
insulted
barclay
tolly
tried
command
the
army
the
best
way
because
wished
fulfill
his
duty
and
earn
fame
great
commander
rostov
charged
the
french
because
could
not
restrain
his
wish
for
gallop
across
level
field
and
the
same
way
the
innumerable
people
who
took
part
the
war
acted
accord
with
their
personal
characteristics
habits
circumstances
and
aims
they
were
moved
fear
vanity
rejoiced
were
indignant
reasoned
imagining
that
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
did
their
own
free
will
but
they
all
were
involuntary
tools
history
carrying
work
concealed
from
them
but
comprehensible
such
the
inevitable
fate
men
action
and
the
higher
they
stand
the
social
hierarchy
the
less
are
they
free
the
actors
have
long
since
left
the
stage
their
personal
interests
have
vanished
leaving
trace
and
nothing
remains
that
time
but
its
historic
results
providence
compelled
all
these
men
striving
attain
personal
aims
further
the
accomplishment
stupendous
result
one
them
all
expected
neither
napoleon
nor
alexander
nor
still
less
any
those
who
did
the
actual
fighting
the
cause
the
destruction
the
french
army
clear
now
one
will
deny
that
that
cause
was
the
one
hand
its
advance
into
the
heart
russia
late
the
season
without
any
preparation
for
winter
campaign
and
the
other
the
character
given
the
war
the
burning
russian
towns
and
the
hatred
the
foe
this
aroused
among
the
russian
people
but
one
the
time
foresaw
what
now
seems
evident
that
this
was
the
only
way
army
eight
hundred
thousand
men
the
best
the
world
and
led
the
best
general
could
destroyed
conflict
with
raw
army
half
its
numerical
strength
and
led
inexperienced
commanders
the
russian
army
was
not
only
did
one
see
this
but
the
russian
side
every
effort
was
made
hinder
the
only
thing
that
could
save
russia
while
the
french
side
despite
napoleon
experience
and
called
military
genius
every
effort
was
directed
pushing
moscow
the
end
the
summer
that
doing
the
very
thing
that
was
bound
lead
destruction
historical
works
the
year
french
writers
are
very
fond
saying
that
napoleon
felt
the
danger
extending
his
line
that
sought
battle
and
that
his
marshals
advised
him
stop
smolensk
and
making
similar
statements
show
that
the
danger
the
campaign
was
even
then
understood
russian
authors
are
still
fonder
telling
that
from
the
commencement
the
campaign
scythian
war
plan
was
adopted
lure
napoleon
into
the
depths
russia
and
this
plan
some
them
attribute
pfuel
others
certain
frenchman
others
toll
and
others
again
alexander
himself
pointing
notes
projects
and
letters
which
contain
hints
such
line
action
but
all
these
hints
what
happened
both
from
the
french
side
and
the
russian
are
advanced
only
because
they
fit
with
the
event
had
that
event
not
occurred
these
hints
would
have
been
forgotten
have
forgotten
the
thousands
and
millions
hints
and
expectations
the
contrary
which
were
current
then
but
have
now
been
forgotten
because
the
event
falsified
them
there
are
always
many
conjectures
the
issue
any
event
that
however
may
end
there
will
always
people
say
said
then
that
would
quite
forgetting
that
amid
their
innumerable
conjectures
many
were
quite
the
contrary
effect
conjectures
napoleon
awareness
the
danger
extending
his
line
and
the
russian
side
luring
the
enemy
into
the
depths
russia
are
evidently
that
kind
and
only
much
straining
can
historians
attribute
such
conceptions
napoleon
and
his
marshals
such
plans
the
russian
commanders
all
the
facts
are
flat
contradiction
such
conjectures
during
the
whole
period
the
war
not
only
was
there
wish
the
russian
side
draw
the
french
into
the
heart
the
country
but
from
their
first
entry
into
russia
everything
was
done
stop
them
and
not
only
was
napoleon
not
afraid
extend
his
line
but
welcomed
every
step
forward
triumph
and
did
not
seek
battle
eagerly
former
campaigns
but
very
lazily
the
very
beginning
the
war
our
armies
were
divided
and
our
sole
aim
was
unite
them
though
uniting
the
armies
was
advantage
meant
retire
and
lure
the
enemy
into
the
depths
the
country
our
emperor
joined
the
army
encourage
defend
every
inch
russian
soil
and
not
retreat
the
enormous
drissa
camp
was
formed
pfuel
plan
and
there
was
intention
retiring
farther
the
emperor
reproached
the
commanders
chief
for
every
step
they
retired
could
not
bear
the
idea
letting
the
enemy
even
reach
smolensk
still
less
could
contemplate
the
burning
moscow
and
when
our
armies
did
unite
was
displeased
that
smolensk
was
abandoned
and
burned
without
general
engagement
having
been
fought
under
its
walls
thought
the
emperor
and
the
russian
commanders
and
people
were
still
more
provoked
the
thought
that
our
forces
were
retreating
into
the
depths
the
country
napoleon
having
cut
our
armies
apart
advanced
far
into
the
country
and
missed
several
chances
forcing
engagement
august
was
smolensk
and
thought
only
how
advance
farther
though
now
see
that
advance
was
evidently
ruinous
him
the
facts
clearly
show
that
napoleon
did
not
foresee
the
danger
the
advance
moscow
nor
did
alexander
and
the
russian
commanders
then
think
luring
napoleon
but
quite
the
contrary
the
luring
napoleon
into
the
depths
the
country
was
not
the
result
any
plan
for
one
believed
possible
resulted
from
most
complex
interplay
intrigues
aims
and
wishes
among
those
who
took
part
the
war
and
had
perception
whatever
the
inevitable
the
one
way
saving
russia
everything
came
about
fortuitously
the
armies
were
divided
the
commencement
the
campaign
tried
unite
them
with
the
evident
intention
giving
battle
and
checking
the
enemy
advance
and
this
effort
unite
them
while
avoiding
battle
with
much
stronger
enemy
and
necessarily
withdrawing
the
armies
acute
angle
led
the
french
smolensk
but
withdrew
acute
angle
not
only
because
the
french
advanced
between
our
two
armies
the
angle
became
still
more
acute
and
withdrew
still
farther
because
barclay
tolly
was
unpopular
foreigner
disliked
bagration
who
would
come
under
his
command
and
bagration
being
command
the
second
army
tried
postpone
joining
and
coming
under
barclay
command
long
could
bagration
was
slow
effecting
the
junction
though
that
was
the
chief
aim
all
headquarters
because
alleged
exposed
his
army
danger
this
march
and
was
best
for
him
retire
more
the
left
and
more
the
south
worrying
the
enemy
from
flank
and
rear
and
securing
from
the
ukraine
recruits
for
his
army
and
looks
planned
this
order
not
come
under
the
command
the
detested
foreigner
barclay
whose
rank
was
inferior
his
own
the
emperor
was
with
the
army
encourage
but
his
presence
and
ignorance
what
steps
take
and
the
enormous
number
advisers
and
plans
destroyed
the
first
army
energy
and
retired
the
intention
was
make
stand
the
drissa
camp
but
paulucci
aiming
becoming
commander
chief
unexpectedly
employed
his
energy
influence
alexander
and
pfuel
whole
plan
was
abandoned
and
the
command
entrusted
barclay
but
barclay
did
not
inspire
confidence
his
power
was
limited
the
armies
were
divided
there
was
unity
command
and
barclay
was
unpopular
but
from
this
confusion
division
and
the
unpopularity
the
foreign
commander
chief
there
resulted
the
one
hand
indecision
and
the
avoidance
battle
which
could
not
have
refrained
from
had
the
armies
been
united
and
had
someone
else
instead
barclay
been
command
and
the
other
ever
increasing
indignation
against
the
foreigners
and
increase
patriotic
zeal
last
the
emperor
left
the
army
and
the
most
convenient
and
indeed
the
only
pretext
for
his
departure
was
decided
that
was
necessary
for
him
inspire
the
people
the
capitals
and
arouse
the
nation

this

and
hoping
that
more
decisive
action
would
then
taken
but
the

armies
became
still
more
confused

enfeebled
bennigsen

tsarevich

keep
the

his
energy
and
barclay
feeling
less
free
than
ever
under
the
observation
all
these
eyes
the
emperor
became
still
more
cautious
undertaking
any
decisive
action
and
avoided
giving
battle
barclay
stood
for
caution
the
tsarevich
hinted
treachery
and
demanded
general
engagement
lubomirski
bronnitski
wlocki
and
the
others
that
group
stirred
much
trouble
that

there

turns
out

farther
and
retired
thus
arriving
the
very
result
which
caused
his
destruction
chapter
the
day
after
his
son
had
left
prince
nicholas
sent
for
princess
mary
come
his
study
well
are
you
satisfied
now
said
you
made
quarrel
with
son
satisfied
are
you
that
all
you
wanted
satisfied
hurts
hurts
old
and
weak
and
this
what
you
wanted
well
then
gloat
over
gloat
over
after
that
princess
mary
did
not
see
her
father
for
whole
week
was
ill
and
did
not
leave
his
study
princess
mary
noticed
her
surprise
that
during
this
illness
the
old
prince
not
only
excluded
her
from
his
room
but
did
not
admit
mademoiselle
bourienne
either
tikhon
alone
attended
him
the
end
the
week
the
prince
reappeared
and
resumed
his
former
way
life
devoting
himself
with
special
activity
building
operations
and
the
arrangement
the
gardens
and
completely
breaking
off
his
relations
with
mademoiselle
bourienne
his
looks
and
cold
tone
his
daughter
seemed
say
there
you
see
you
plotted
against
you
lied
prince
andrew
about
relations
with
that
frenchwoman
and
made
quarrel
with
him
but
you
see
need
neither
her
nor
you
princess
mary
spent
half
every
day
with
little
nicholas
watching
his
lessons
teaching
him
russian
and
music
herself
and
talking
dessalles
the
rest
the
day
she
spent
over
her
books
with
her
old
nurse
with
god
folk
who
sometimes
came
the
back
door
see
her
the
war
princess
mary
thought
women
think
about
wars
she
feared
for
her
brother
who
was
was
horrified
and
amazed
the
strange
cruelty
that
impels
men
kill
one
another
but
she
did
not
understand
the
significance
this
war
which
seemed
her
like
all
previous
wars
she
did
not
realize
the
significance
this
war
though
dessalles
with
whom
she
constantly
conversed
was
passionately
interested
its
progress
and
tried
explain
his
own
conception
her
and
though
the
god
folk
who
came
see
her
reported
their
own
way
the
rumors
current
among
the
people
invasion
antichrist
and
though
julie
now
princess
drubetskaya
who
had
resumed
correspondence
with
her
wrote
patriotic
letters
from
moscow
write
you
russian
good
friend
wrote
julie
her
frenchified
russian
because
have
detestation
for
all
the
french
and
the
same
for
their
language
which
cannot
support
hear
spoken
moscow
are
elated
enthusiasm
for
our
adored
emperor
poor
husband
enduring
pains
and
hunger
jewish
taverns
but
the
news
which
have
inspires
yet
more
you
heard
probably
the
heroic
exploit
raevski
embracing
his
two
sons
and
saying
will
perish
with
them
but
will
not
shaken
and
truly
though
the
enemy
was
twice
stronger
than
were
unshakable
pass
the
time
can
but
war
war
the
princesses
aline
and
sophie
sit
whole
days
with
and
unhappy
widows
live
men
make
beautiful
conversations
over
our
charpie
only
you
friend
are
missing
and
the
chief
reason
princess
mary
did
not
realize
the
full
significance
this
war
was
that
the
old
prince
never
spoke
did
not
recognize
and
laughed
dessalles
when
mentioned
dinner
the
prince
tone
was
calm
and
confident
that
princess
mary
unhesitatingly
believed
him
all
that
july
the
old
prince
was
exceedingly
active
and
even
animated
planned
another
garden
and
began
new
building
for
the
domestic
serfs
the
only
thing
that
made
princess
mary
anxious
about
him
was
that
slept
very
little
and
instead
sleeping
his
study
usual
changed
his
sleeping
place
every
day
one
day
would
order
his
camp
bed
set
the
glass
gallery
another
day
remained
the
couch
the
lounge
chair
the
drawing
room
and
dozed
there
without
undressing
while
instead
mademoiselle
bourienne
serf
boy
read
him
then
again
would
spend
night
the
dining
room

michael

rose
and
went

but
soon
had
left
the

the

looking
uneasily
round
threw
down
his
napkin
and
went
himself
they

make
some
muddle
muttered
while
was
away
princess

dessalles
mademoiselle

and
even
little
nicholas
exchanged
looks
silence
the
old
prince
returned
with

steps
accompanied
michael

dinner
moving
the

room
handed
the
letter
princess
mary
and
spreading
out
before
him
the
plan
the
new
building
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
told
her
read
the
letter
aloud
when
she
had
done
princess
mary
looked
inquiringly
her
father
was
examining
the
plan
evidently
engrossed
his
own
ideas
what
you
think
prince
dessalles
ventured
ask
said
the
prince
unpleasantly
awakened
and
not
taking
his
eyes
from
the
plan
the
building
very
possibly
the
theater
war
will
move
near
that
the
theater
war
said
the
prince
have
said
and
still
say
that
the
theater
war
poland
and
the
enemy
will
never
get
beyond
the
niemen
dessalles
looked
amazement
the
prince
who
was
talking
the
niemen
when
the
enemy
was
already
the
dnieper
but
princess
mary
forgetting
the
geographical
position
the
niemen
thought
that
what
her
father
was
saying
was
correct
when
the
snow
melts
they
sink
the
polish
swamps
only
they
could
fail
see
the
prince
continued
evidently
thinking
the
campaign
which
seemed
him
recent
bennigsen
should
have
advanced
into
prussia
sooner
then
things
would
have
taken
different
turn
but
prince
dessalles
began
timidly
the
letter
mentions
vitebsk
the
letter
yes
replied
the
prince
peevishly
yes
yes
his
face
suddenly
took
morose
expression
paused
yes
writes
that
the
french
were
beaten
what
river
dessalles
dropped
his
eyes
the
prince
says
nothing
about
that
remarked
gently
doesn
but
didn
invent
myself
one
spoke
for
long
time
yes
yes
well
michael
ivanovich
suddenly
went
raising
his
head
and
pointing
the
plan
the
building
tell
how
you
mean
alter
michael
ivanovich
went
the
plan
and
the
prince
after
speaking
him
about
the
building
looked
angrily
princess
mary
and
dessalles
and
went
his
own
room
princess
mary
saw
dessalles
embarrassed
and
astonished
look
fixed
her
father
noticed
his
silence
and
was
struck
the
fact
that
her
father
had
forgotten
his
son
letter
the
drawing
room
table
but
she
was
not
only
afraid
speak
and
ask
dessalles
the
reason
his
confusion
and
silence
but
was
afraid
even
think
about
the
evening
michael
ivanovich
sent
the
prince
came
princess
mary
for
prince
andrew
letter
which
had
been
forgotten
the
drawing

gave
him
and
unpleasant
was
her
ventured
ask
him
what
her
father
was
doing
always
busy
replied
michael
ivanovich
with
respectfully
ironic
smile
which
caused
princess
mary
turn
pale
worrying
very
much
about
the
new
building

been
reading
little
but
now
michael
ivanovich
went
lowering
his
voice
now
his

busy
with

the

favorite
occupations
late
had
been

over
his
eyes
was
sitting

open
bureau
with
screened
candles
holding

outstretched
hand
and
somewhat
dramatic
attitude
was
reading
his
manuscript
his
remarks
termed
which
was
transmitted
the
emperor
after
his
death
when
michael
ivanovich
went

had
ordered

the
will
the
instructions
alpatych
took
over
two
hours
and
still
the
prince
did
not
let
him

down
sank
into
thought
closed
his
eyes
and
dozed
off
alpatych
made
slight
movement

was
already
late
when

after

wished
sleep
but
knew
would
not

and
that
most
depressing
thoughts
came
him

called
tikhon
and
went
through
the
rooms
with
him
show
him
where
set
the
bed
for
that
night
went
about
looking
every
corner
every
place
seemed
unsatisfactory
but
worst
all
was
his
customary
couch
the
study
that
couch
was
dreadful
him
probably
because
the
oppressive
thoughts
had
had
when
lying
there
was
unsatisfactory
everywhere
but
the
corner
behind
the
piano
the
sitting
room
was
better
than
other
places
had
never
slept
there
yet
with
the
help
footman
tikhon
brought
the
bedstead
and
began
putting
that
not
right
that
not
right
cried
the
prince
and
himself
pushed
few
inches
from
the
corner
and
then
closer
again
well
last
finished
now

the

and
let
tikhon
undress
him
frowning
with
vexation
the
effort
necessary
divest
himself
his
coat
and
trousers
the
prince
undressed
sat
down
heavily
the
bed
and
appeared
meditating
looked
contemptuously
his
withered
yellow
legs
was
not
meditating
but
only
deferring
the
moment
making
the
effort
lift
those
legs
and
turn
over
the
bed
ugh
how
hard
that
this
toil
might
end
and
you
would
release
thought
pressing
his
lips
together
made
that
effort
for
the
twenty
thousandth
time
and
lay
down
but
hardly
had
done
before
felt
the
bed
rocking
backwards
and
forwards

alpatych
himself
and
started
his

looking
round
the

yellow
rye
and
the
still
green
thickly
growing
oats
and
other
quite
black
fields
just
being

the
strips
ryefield
which
here
and
there
were
already
being
reaped
made
his
calculations
the
sowing
and
the
harvest
and
asked
himself
whether

not
forgotten
any
the
prince
orders
having
baited
the
horses
twice
the
way
arrived
the
town
toward
evening

kept
meeting
and
overtaking
baggage
trains
and
troops
the
road
approached
smolensk
heard
the
sounds
distant
firing
but
these
did
not
impress
him
what
struck
him
most
was
the
sight
splendid
field
oats
which
camp
had
been
pitched
and
which
was
being
mown
down
the
soldiers
evidently
for
fodder
this
fact
impressed
alpatych
but
thinking
about
his
own
business
soon
forgot
all
the
interests
his
life
for
more
than
thirty
years
had
been
bounded
the
will
the
prince
and
never
went
beyond
that
limit
everything
not
connected
with
the
execution
the

orders
did
not
interest
and
did
not
even
exist

one
day
alpatych
collected
his
parcels
handed
them
the
coachman
who
had
come
and
settled
with
the
innkeeper
the
noise
wheels
hoofs
and
bells
was
heard
from
the
gateway
little
trap
passed
out
was
now
late
the
afternoon
half
the
street
was
shadow
the
other
half
brightly
lit
the
sun
alpatych
looked
out
the
window
and
went
the
door
suddenly
the
strange
sound
far
off
whistling
and
thud
was
heard
followed
boom
cannon
blending
into
dull
roar
that
set
the
windows
rattling
went
out
into
the
street
two
men
were
running
past
toward
the
bridge
from
different
sides
came
whistling
sounds
and
the
thud
cannon
balls
and
bursting
shells
falling
the
town
but
these
sounds
were
hardly
heard
comparison
with
the
noise
the
firing
outside
the
town
and
attracted
little
attention
from
the
inhabitants
the
town
was
being
bombarded
hundred
and
thirty
guns
which
napoleon
had
ordered
after
four
clock
the
people
did
not
once
realize
the
meaning
this
bombardment
first
the
noise
the
falling
bombs
and
shells
only
aroused
curiosity
ferapontov
wife
who
till
then
had
not
ceased
wailing
under
the
shed
became
quiet
and
with
the
baby
her
arms
went
the
gate
listening
the
sounds
and
looking
silence
the
people
the
cook
and
shop
assistant
came
the
gate
with
lively
curiosity
everyone
tried
get
glimpse
the
projectiles
they
flew
over
their
heads
several
people
came
round
the
corner
talking
eagerly
what
force
remarked
one
knocked
the
roof
and
ceiling
all
splinters
routed
the
earth
like
pig
said
another
that
grand
bucks
one
laughed
the
first
lucky
you
jumped
aside
would
have
wiped
you
out
others
joined
those
men
and
stopped
and
told
how
cannon
balls
had
fallen
house
close
them
meanwhile
still
more
projectiles
now
with
the
swift
sinister
whistle
cannon
ball
now
with
the
agreeable
intermittent
whistle
shell
flew
over
people
heads
incessantly
but
not
one
fell
close
they
all
flew
over
alpatych
was
getting
into
his
trap
the
innkeeper
stood
the
gate
what
are
you
staring
shouted
the
cook
who
her
red
skirt
with
sleeves
rolled
swinging
her
bare
elbows
had
stepped
the
corner
listen
what
was
being
said
what
marvels
she
exclaimed
but
hearing
her
master
voice
she
turned
back
pulling
down
her
tucked
skirt
once
more
something
whistled
but
this
time
quite
close
swooping
downwards
like
little
bird
flame
flashed
the
middle
the
street
something
exploded
and
the
street
was
shrouded
smoke
scoundrel
what
are
you
doing
shouted
the
innkeeper
rushing
the
cook
that
moment
the
pitiful
wailing
women
was
heard
from
different
sides
the
frightened
baby
began
cry
and
people
crowded
silently
with
pale
faces
round
the
cook
the
loudest
sound
that
crowd
was
her
wailing
dear
souls
dear
kind
souls
don
let
die
good
souls
five
minutes
later
one
remained
the
street
the
cook
with
her
thigh
broken
shell
splinter
had
been
carried
into
the
kitchen
alpatych
his
coachman
ferapontov
wife
and
children
and
the
house
porter
were
all
sitting
the
cellar
listening
the
roar
guns
the
whistling
projectiles
and
the
piteous
moaning
the
cook
which
rose
above
the
other
sounds
did
not
cease
for
moment
the
mistress
rocked
and
hushed
her
baby
and
when
anyone
came
into
the
cellar
asked
pathetic
whisper
what
had
become
her
husband
who
had
remained
the
street
shopman
who
entered
told
her
that
her
husband
had
gone
with
others

cathedral
whence
they
were
fetching
the
wonder
working
icon
smolensk
toward
dusk
the
cannonade
began
subside
alpatych
left
the
cellar
and
stopped
the
doorway
the
evening
sky
that
had
been
clear
was
clouded
with
smoke
through
which
high
the
sickle
the
new
moon
shone
strangely
now
that
the
terrible
din
the
guns
had
ceased
hush
seemed
reign
over
the
town
broken
only
the
rustle
footsteps
the
moaning
the
distant
cries
and
the
crackle
fires
which
seemed
widespread
everywhere
the
cook
moans
had
now
subsided
two
sides
black
curling
clouds
smoke
rose
and
spread
from
the
fires
through
the
streets
soldiers

uniforms
walked

the
smoke
and
even
the
flames
which
could

the
failing
twilight
and
reply
the

kind
lamentation
was
heard
from

and
the

already
burning
itself
out
the

died
down
and
were

suddenly
flared
again
brightly
lighting
with
strange
distinctness
the
faces
the
people
crowding
the
crossroads
black
figures
flitted
about
before
the
fire
and
through
the
incessant
crackling

and
something
huge
collapsed

beside

and
rode
down
the
side
street
chapter
from
smolensk
the
troops
continued
retreat
followed
the
enemy
the
tenth
august
the
regiment
prince
andrew
commanded
was
marching
along
the
highroad
past
the
avenue
leading
bald
hills
heat
and
drought
had
continued
for
more
than
three
weeks
each
day
fleecy
clouds
floated
across
the
sky
and
occasionally
veiled
the
sun
but
toward
evening
the
sky
cleared
again
and
the
sun
set
reddish
brown
mist
heavy
night
dews
alone
refreshed
the
earth
the
unreaped
corn
was
scorched
and
shed
its
grain
the
marshes
dried
the
cattle
lowed
from
hunger
finding
food
the
sun
parched
meadows
only
night
and
the
forests
while
the
dew
lasted
was
there
any
freshness
but
the
road
the
highroad
along
which
the
troops
marched
there
was
such
freshness
even
night
when
the
road
passed
through
the
forest
the
dew
was
imperceptible
the
sandy
dust
churned
more
than
six
inches
deep
soon
day
dawned
the
march
began
the
artillery
and
baggage
wagons
moved
noiselessly
through
the
deep
dust
that
rose
the
very
hubs
the
wheels
and
the
infantry
sank
ankle
deep
that
soft
choking
hot
dust
that
never
cooled
even
night
some
this
dust
was
kneaded
the
feet
and
wheels
while
the
rest
rose
and
hung
like
cloud
over
the
troops
settling
eyes
ears
hair
and
nostrils
and
worst
all
the
lungs
the
men
and
beasts
they
moved
along
that
road
the
higher
the
sun
rose
the
higher
rose
that
cloud
dust
and
through
the
screen
its
hot
fine
particles
one
could
look
with
naked
eye
the
sun
which
showed
like
huge
crimson
ball
the
unclouded
sky
there
was
wind
and
the
men
choked
that
motionless
atmosphere
they
marched
with
handkerchiefs
tied
over
their
noses
and
mouths
when
they
passed
through
village
they
all
rushed
the
wells
and
fought
for
the
water
and
drank
down
the
mud
prince
andrew
was
command
regiment
and
the
management
that
regiment
the
welfare
the
men
and
the
necessity
receiving
and
giving
orders
engrossed
him
the
burning
smolensk
and
its
abandonment
made
epoch
his
life
novel
feeling
anger
against
the
foe
made
him
forget
his
own
sorrow
was
entirely
devoted
the
affairs
his
regiment
and
was
considerate
and
kind
his
men
and
officers
the
regiment
they
called
him
our
prince
were
proud
him
and
loved
him
but
was
kind
and
gentle
only
those
his
regiment
timokhin
and
the
like
people
quite
new
him
belonging
different
world
and
who
could
not
know
and
understand
his
past
soon
came
across
former
acquaintance
anyone
from
the
staff
bristled
immediately
and
grew
spiteful
ironical
and
contemptuous
everything
that
reminded
him
his
past
was
repugnant
him
and
his
relations
with
that
former
circle
confined
himself
trying
his
duty
and
not
unfair
truth
everything
presented
itself
dark
and
gloomy
light
prince
andrew
especially
after
the
abandonment
smolensk
the
sixth
august
considered
that
could
and
should
have
been
defended
and
after
his
sick
father
had
had
flee
moscow
abandoning
pillage
his
dearly
beloved
bald
hills
which
had
built
and
peopled
but
despite
this
thanks
his
regiment
prince
andrew
had
something
think
about
entirely
apart
from
general
questions
two
days
previously
had
received
news
that
his
father
son
and
sister
had
left
for
moscow
and
though
there
was
nothing
for
him
bald
hills
prince
andrew
with
characteristic
desire
foment
his
own
grief
decided
that
must
ride
there
ordered
his
horse
saddled
and
leaving
his
regiment
the
march
rode
his
father
estate
where
had
been
born
and
spent
his
childhood
riding
past
the
pond
where
there
used
always
dozens
women
chattering
they
rinsed
their
linen
beat
with
wooden
beetles
prince
andrew
noticed
that
there
was
not
soul
about
and
that
the
little
washing
wharf
torn
from
its
place
and
half
submerged
was
floating
its
side
the
middle
the
pond
rode
the
keeper
lodge
one
the
stone
entrance
gates
the

that

out
with
his
spectacles
his

have
the
oats
and
take

for

inquired
what
say
him
thought
prince
andrew
looking
down
the
old
man
bald
head
shining
the
sun
and
seeing
the
expression
his
face
that
the
old
man
himself
understood
how
untimely
such
questions
were
and
only
asked
them
allay
his
grief
yes
let
them
have
replied
prince
andrew
you
noticed
some
disorder
the
garden
said
alpatych
was
impossible
prevent
three
regiments
have
been
here
and
spent
the
night
dragoons
mostly
took
down
the

and
rank
their
commanding
officer
hand
complaint
about
well
and
what
are
you
going
will
you
stay
here
the
enemy
occupies
the
place
asked
prince
andrew
alpatych
turned
his
face
prince
andrew
looked
him
and
suddenly
with
solemn
gesture
raised
his
arm
refuge
his
will
done
exclaimed
group
bareheaded
peasants
was
approaching
across
the
meadow
toward
the
prince
well
good
said
prince
andrew
bending
over
alpatych
you
must
away
too
take
away
what
you
can
and
tell
the
serfs
the
ryazan
estate
the
one
near
moscow
alpatych
clung
prince
andrew
leg
and
burst
into
sobs
gently
disengaging
himself
the
prince
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
down
the
avenue
gallop
the
old
man
was
still
sitting
the
ornamental
garden
like
fly
impassive
the
face
loved
one
who
dead
tapping
the
last
which
was
making
the
bast
shoe
and
two
little
girls
running
out
from
the
hot
house
carrying
their
skirts
plums
they
had
plucked
from
the
trees
there
came
upon
prince
andrew
seeing
the
young
master
the
elder
one
with
frightened
look
clutched
her
younger
companion
the
hand
and
hid
with
her
behind
birch
tree
not
stopping
pick
some
green
plums
they
had
dropped
prince
andrew
turned
away
with
startled
haste
unwilling
let
them
see
that
they
had
been
observed
was
sorry
for
the
pretty
frightened
little
girl
was
afraid
looking
her
and
yet
felt
irresistible
desire
new
sensation
comfort
and
relief
came
over
him
when
seeing
these
girls
realized
the
existence
other
human
interests
entirely
aloof
from
his
own
and
just
legitimate
those
that
occupied
him
evidently
these
girls
passionately
desired
one
thing
carry
away
and
eat
those
green
plums
without
being
caught
and
prince
andrew
shared
their
wish
for
the
success
their
enterprise
could
not
resist
looking
them
once
more
believing
their
danger
past
they
sprang
from
their
ambush
and
chirruping
something
their
shrill
little
voices
and
holding
their
skirts
their
bare
little
sunburned
feet
scampered
merrily
and
quickly
across
the
meadow
grass
prince
andrew
was
somewhat
refreshed
having
ridden
off
the
dusty
highroad
along
which
the
troops
were
moving
but
not
far
from
bald
hills
again
came
out
the
road
and
overtook
his
regiment
its
halting
place
the
dam
small
pond
was
past
one
clock
the
sun
red
ball
through
the
dust
burned
and
scorched
his
back
intolerably
through
his
black
coat
the
dust
always
hung
motionless
above
the
buzz
talk
that
came
from
the
resting
troops
there
was
wind
crossed
the
dam
prince
andrew
smelled
the
ooze
and
freshness
the
pond
longed
get
into
that
water
however
dirty
might
and
glanced
round
the
pool
from
whence
came
sounds
shrieks
and
laughter
the
small
muddy
green
pond
had
risen
visibly
more
than
foot
flooding
the
dam
because
was
full
the
naked
white
bodies
soldiers
with
brick
red
hands
necks
and
faces
who
were
splashing
about
all
this
naked
white
human
flesh
laughing
and
shrieking
floundered
about
that
dirty
pool
like
carp
stuffed
into
watering
can
and
the
suggestion
merriment
that
floundering
mass
rendered
specially
pathetic
one
fair
haired
young
soldier
the
third
company
whom
prince
andrew
knew
and
who
had
strap
round
the
calf
one
leg
crossed
himself
stepped
back
get
good
run
and
plunged
into
the
water
another
dark
noncommissioned
officer
who
was
always
shaggy
stood
his
waist
the
water
joyfully
wriggling
his
muscular
figure
and
snorted
with
satisfaction
poured
the
water
over
his
head
with
hands
blackened
the
wrists
there
were
sounds
men
slapping
one
another
yelling
and
puffing
everywhere
the
bank
the
dam
and
the
pond
there
was
healthy
white
muscular
flesh
the
officer
timokhin
with
his
red
little
nose
standing
the
dam
wiping
himself
with
towel
felt
confused
seeing
the
prince
but
made
his
mind
address
him
nevertheless
very
nice
your
excellency
wouldn
you
like
said
dirty
replied
prince
andrew
making
grimace
clear
out
for
you
minute
said
timokhin
and
still
undressed
ran
off
clear
the
men
out
the
pond
the
prince
wants
bathe
what
prince
ours
said
many
voices
and
the
men
were
such
haste
clear
out
that
the
prince
could
hardly
stop
them
decided
that
would
rather
wash
himself
with
water
the
barn
flesh
bodies
cannon
fodder
thought
and
looked
his
own
naked
body
and
shuddered
not
from
cold
but
from
sense
disgust
and
horror
did
not
himself
understand
aroused
the
sight
that
immense
number
bodies
splashing
about
the
dirty
pond
the
seventh
august
prince
bagration
wrote

his
quarters

dear
count

already

the

the

that
this
most
important
place
has
been
wantonly
abandoned
for
part
begged
him
personally
most
urgently
and
finally
wrote
him
but
nothing
would
induce
him
consent
swear
you
honor
that
napoleon
was
such
fix
never
before
and
might
have
lost
half
his
army
but
could
not
have
taken

our
troops
fought
and
are
fighting
never
before
with
fifteen
thousand
men
held
the
enemy
bay
for
thirty
five
hours
and
beat
him
but
would
not

out
even
for
fourteen
hours
disgraceful
stain
our
army
and
for
him
ought
seems
not

reports
that
our
losses
were
great
not
true
perhaps
about
four
thousand
not
more
and
not
even
that
but
even
were
they
ten
thousand
that
war
but
the
enemy
has
lost

what

clear
that
the
man

since
the

had
made

and
had
again
quarreled
with
bonaparte
and
had
made
constitutions
and
unmade

again
but
the
salons
anna

remained
just
they

and

five
years
before

shown

regarding

remarkably
intelligent

they
talked
with
the

ecstasy
the

regretted
our
rupture
with

rupture
which
according
them

promptly
terminated

late
since
the
emperor

from

there
had
been
some
excitement
these
conflicting

each
camp
retained
its
own
tendency
anna

circle
only
those
frenchmen
were
admitted
who
were

views
were

the
effect

flattering

were
circulated
the
french
circle
helene
and
rumyantsev
the
reports
the
cruelty
the

contradicted
and

vasili
conversation
about

anna
pavlovna
severely
condemned
barclay
tolly
but
was
undecided
who
ought
appointed
commander
chief
one
the
visitors
usually
spoken
man
great
merit
having
described
how
had
that
day
seen
kutuzov
the
newly
chosen
chief
the
petersburg
militia
presiding
over
the
enrollment
recruits
the
treasury
cautiously
ventured
suggest
that
kutuzov
would
the
man
satisfy
all
requirements
anna
pavlovna
remarked
with
melancholy
smile
that
kutuzov
had
done
nothing
but
cause
the
emperor
annoyance
have
talked
and
talked
the
assembly
the
nobility
prince
vasili
interrupted
but
they
did
not
listen
told
them
his
election
chief
the
militia
would
not
please
the
emperor
they
did
not
listen
all
this
mania
for
opposition
went
and
who
for
all
because
want
ape
the
foolish
enthusiasm
those
muscovites
prince
vasili
continued
forgetting
for
moment
that
though
helene
one
had
ridicule
the
moscow
enthusiasm
anna
pavlovna
one
had
ecstatic
about
but
retrieved
his
mistake
once
now
suitable
that
count
kutuzov
the
oldest
general
russia
should
preside
that
tribunal
will
get
nothing
for
his
pains
how
could
they
make
man
commander
chief
who
cannot
mount
horse
who
drops
asleep
council
and
has
the
very
worst
morals
good
reputation
made
for
himself
bucharest

see
anything

bluff
can
see
all

replied
his
remarks
this
was
quite
correct
the
twenty
fourth
july
but
the
twenty
ninth
july
kutuzov
received
the
title
prince
this
might
indicate
wish
get
rid
him
and
therefore
prince
vasili
opinion
continued
correct
though
was
not
now
any
hurry
express
but
the
eighth
august
committee
consisting
field
marshal
saltykov
arakcheev
vyazmitinov
lopukhin
and
kochubey
met
consider
the
progress
the

this
committee
came
the
conclusion
that
our
failures
were
due
want
unity
the
command
and
though
the
members
the
committee
were
aware
the
emperor
dislike
kutuzov
after
short
deliberation
they
agreed
advise
his
appointment
commander
chief
that

was
appointed

the

great
merit
despite
his
desire

the
post

could
not
refrain
from
reminding

his
former
opinion
though
this
was
impolite

room
and
also
anna
pavlovna
herself
who
had
received
the
news
with
delight
could
not

and
what
pleased
about

that
our

given
him
full
powers
over
all

abashed
but
merely
did
his

gain
his

favor
knew
very
well
that
this
was

could

telling

when

asked
him
whether
the

thought
they
would
beat

not
lavrushka
screwed
his

and
considered
this
question
saw
subtle

everything
frowned
and

said
thoughtfully
there
battle

later
god
knows
what
will
happen
napoleon
did
not
smile
though
was
evidently
high
good
humor
and
ordered
these

this
and

who
napoleon
was
added
know
that
you
have
bonaparte
and
that
has
beaten
everybody
the

but
are
different
matter
without
knowing
why
how
this
bit
boastful
patriotism
slipped
out
the
end
the
interpreter
translated
these
words
without
the
last
phrase
and
bonaparte
smiled
the
young
cossack
made
his
mighty
interlocutor
smile
says
thiers
after
riding
few
paces

napoleon
turned

unceasingly
his

this

there

what

was

strenuous
and

quite
opposed
the

the

the
rural

having
come

urged
the

thing
saying
that
the
french
were
only
some
twenty
five
miles
away
that
french
proclamations
were
circulating
the
villages
and
that
the

where
the

lay
several
times
waking
she
heard
his
groans
and
muttering
the
creak
his

and
the
steps
tikhon
and
the
doctor
when
they
turned
him
over
several
times
she
listened
the
door
and
seemed
her
that
his
mutterings
were
louder
than
usual
and
that
they
turned
him
over
oftener
she
could
not
sleep
and
several
times
went
the

and
listened
wishing

saw
and
knew
how
unpleasant
every

his
account
was

she
had
noticed
with
what
dissatisfaction
turned
from
the
look
she
sometimes
involuntarily
fixed
him
she
knew
that
her
going
during
the
night
unusual
hour
would
irritate
him
but
never
had
she
felt
grieved
for
him
much
afraid
losing
him
she
recalled
all
her

with
him
and
every

occasionally
amid

surge
into

how

how

but
she
drove
these

away
with
disgust
toward

became
quiet
and
she
fell
asleep
she
woke
late
that
sincerity
which
often
comes
with
waking
showed
her
clearly
what
chiefly
concerned
her
about
her
father
illness
waking
she
listened
what
was
going
behind
the
door
and
hearing
him
groan
said
herself
with
sigh
that
things
were
still
the

but
what
could
have
happened
what
did
want
want
his
death
she
cried
with
feeling
loathing
for

she
washed

prayers

and
terror

said
the
doctor
princess
mary
entered
her
father
room
and
went
his
bed
was
lying
his
back
propped
high
and
his
small
bony
hands
with
their
knotted
purple
veins
were
lying
the
quilt
his
left
eye
gazed
straight
before
him
his
right
eye
was
awry
and
his
brows
and
lips
motionless
seemed
altogether
thin
small
and
pathetic
his
face
seemed
have
shriveled
melted
his
features
had
grown
smaller
princess
mary
went
and
kissed
his
hand
his
left
hand
pressed
hers
that
she
understood
that
had
long
been
waiting
for
her
come
twitched
her
hand
and
his
brows
and
lips
quivered
angrily
she
looked
him
dismay
trying
guess
what
wanted
her
when
she
changed
her
position
that
his
left
eye
could
see
her
face
calmed
down
not
taking
his
eyes
off
her
for
some
seconds
then
his
lips
and
tongue
moved
sounds
came
and
began
speak
gazing
timidly
and
imploringly
her
evidently
afraid
that
she
might
not
understand
straining
all
her
faculties
princess
mary
looked
him
the
comic
efforts
with
which
moved
his
tongue
made
her
drop
her
eyes
and
with
difficulty
repress
the
sobs
that
rose
her
throat
said
something
repeating
the
same
words
several
times
she
could
not
understand
them
but
tried
guess
what
was
saying
and
inquiringly
repeated
the
words
uttered
mmm
ate
ate
repeated
several
times
was
quite
impossible
understand
these
sounds
the
doctor
thought
had
guessed
them
and
inquiringly
repeated
mary
are
you
afraid
the
prince
shook
his
head
again
repeated
the
same
sounds
mind
mind
aches
questioned
princess
mary
made
mumbling
sound
confirmation
this
took
her
hand
and
began
pressing
different
parts
his
breast
trying
find
the
right
place
for
always
thoughts
about
you
thoughts
then
uttered
much
more
clearly
than
had
done
before
now
that
was
sure
being
understood
princess
mary
pressed
her
head
against
his
hand
trying
hide
her
sobs
and
tears
moved
his
hand
over
her
hair
have
been
calling
you
all
night
brought
out
only
had
known
she
said
through
her
tears
was
afraid
come
pressed
her
hand
weren
you
asleep
did
not
sleep
said
princess
mary
shaking
her
head
unconsciously
imitating
her
father
she
now
tried
express
herself
did
much
possible
signs
and
her
tongue
too
seemed
move
with
difficulty
dear
one
dearest
princess
mary
could
not
quite
make
out
what
had
said
but
from
his
look
was
clear
that
had
uttered
tender
caressing
word
such
had
never
used
her
before
why
didn
you
come
and
was
wishing
for
his
death
thought
princess
mary
was
silent
awhile
thank
you
daughter
dear
for
all
for
all
forgive
thank
you
forgive
thank
you
and
tears
began
flow
from
his
eyes
call
andrew
said
suddenly
and
childish
timid
expression
doubt
showed
itself
his
face
spoke
himself
seemed
aware
that
his
demand
was
meaningless
least
seemed
princess
mary
have
letter
from
him
she
replied
glanced
her
with
timid
surprise
where
with
the
army
father
smolensk
closed
his
eyes
and
remained
silent
long
time
then
answer
his
doubts
and
confirm
the
fact
that
now
understood
and
remembered
everything
nodded
his
head
and
reopened
his
eyes
yes
said
softly
and
distinctly
russia
has
perished
they
destroyed
her
and
began
sob
and
again
tears
flowed
from
his
eyes
princess
mary
could
longer
restrain
herself
and
wept
while
she
gazed
his
face
again
closed
his
eyes
his
sobs
ceased
pointed
his
eyes
and
tikhon
understanding
him
wiped
away
the
tears
then
again
opened
his
eyes
and
said
something
none
them
could
understand
for
long
time
till
last
tikhon
understood
and
repeated
princess
mary
had
sought
the
meaning
his
words
the
mood
which
had
just
been
speaking
she
thought
was
speaking
russia
prince
andrew
herself
his
grandson
his
own
death
and
she
could
not
guess
his
words
put
your
white
dress
like
was
what
said
having
understood
this
princess
mary
sobbed
still
louder
and
the
doctor
taking
her
arm
led
her
out
the
veranda
soothing
her
and
trying
persuade
her
prepare
for
her
journey
when
she
had
left
the
room
the
prince
again
began
speaking
about
his
son
about
the
war
and
about
the
emperor
angrily
twitching
his
brows
and
raising
his
hoarse
voice
and
then
had
second
and
final
stroke
princess
mary
stayed
the
veranda
the
day
had
cleared
was
hot
and
sunny
she
could
understand
nothing
think
nothing
and
feel
nothing
except
passionate
love
for
her
father
love
such
she
thought
she
had
never
felt
till
that
moment
she
ran
out
sobbing
into
the
garden
and
far
the
pond
along
the
avenues
young
lime
trees
prince
andrew
had
planted
yes
wished
for
his
death
yes
wanted
end
quicker
wished
peace
and
what
will
become
what
use
will
peace
when
longer
here
princess
mary
murmured
pacing
the
garden
with
hurried
steps
and
pressing
her
hands
her
bosom
which
heaved
with
convulsive
sobs
when
she
had
completed
the
tour
the
garden
which
brought
her
again
the
house
she
saw
mademoiselle
bourienne
who
had
remained
bogucharovo
and
did
not
wish
leave
coming
toward
her
with
stranger
this
was
the
marshal
the
nobility
the
district
who
had
come
personally
point
out
the
princess
the
necessity
for
her
prompt
departure
princess
mary
listened
without
understanding
him
she
led
him
the
house
offered
him
lunch
and
sat
down
with
him
then
excusing
herself
she
went
the
door
the
old
prince
room
the
doctor
came
out
with
agitated
face
and
said
she
could
not
enter
away
princess
away
away
she
returned
the
garden
and
sat
down
the
grass
the
foot
the
slope
the
pond
where
one
could
see
her
she
did
not
know
how
long
she
had
been
there
when
she
was
aroused
the
sound
woman
footsteps
running
along
the
path
she
rose
and
saw
dunyasha
her
maid
who
was
evidently
looking
for
her
and
who
stopped
suddenly
alarm
seeing
her
mistress
please
come
princess
the
prince
said
dunyasha
breaking
voice
immediately
coming
coming
replied
the
princess
hurriedly
not
giving
dunyasha
time
finish
what
she
was
saying
and
trying
avoid
seeing
the
girl
she
ran
toward
the
house
princess
god
will
you
must
prepared
for
everything
said
the
marshal
meeting
her
the
house
door
let
alone
not
true
she
cried
angrily
him
the
doctor
tried
stop
her
she
pushed
him
aside
and
ran
her
father
door
why
are
these
people
with
frightened
faces
stopping
don
want
any
them
and
what
are
they
doing
here
she
thought
she
opened
the
door
and
the
bright
daylight
that
previously
darkened
room
startled
her
the
room
were
her
nurse
and
other
women
they
all
drew
back
from
the
bed
making
way
for
her
was
still
lying
the
bed
before
but
the
stern
expression
his
quiet
face
made
princess
mary
stop
short
the
threshold
not
dead
impossible
she
told
herself
and
approached
him
and
repressing
the
terror
that
seized
her
she
pressed
her
lips
his
cheek
but
she
stepped
back
immediately
all
the
force
the
tenderness
she
had
been
feeling
for
him
vanished
instantly
and
was
replaced
feeling
horror
what
lay
there
before
her
more
not
but
here
where
was
something
unfamiliar
and
hostile
some
dreadful
terrifying
and
repellent
mystery
and
hiding
her
face
her
hands
princess
mary
sank
into
the
arms
the
doctor
who
held
her
the
presence
tikhon
and
the
doctor
the
women
washed
what
had
been
the
prince
tied
his
head
with
handkerchief
that
the
mouth
should
not
stiffen
while
open
and
with
another
handkerchief
tied
together
the
legs
that
were
already
spreading
apart
then
they
dressed
him
uniform
with
his
decorations
and
placed
his
shriveled
little
body
table
heaven
only
knows
who
arranged
all
this
and
when
but
all
got
done
its
own
accord
toward
night
candles
were
burning
round
his
coffin
pall
was
spread
over
the
floor
was
strewn
with
sprays
juniper
printed
band
was
tucked
under
his
shriveled
head
and
corner
the
room
sat

reading
the
psalms
just
horses
shy
and
snort
and
gather
about

the
inmates
the

and

crowded
into
the
drawing
room
round
the
coffin
the

the
village
elder
peasant
women
and
all
with
fixed
and
frightened
eyes
crossing
themselves
bowed
and
kissed
the
old
prince
cold
and
stiffened
hand
chapter
until
prince
andrew
settled
bogucharovo
its
owners
had
always
been
absentees
and
its
peasants
were
quite
different
character
from
those
bald
hills
they
differed
from
them
speech
dress
and
disposition
they
were
called
steppe

the
old
prince
used
approve
them
for
their
endurance
work
when
they
came

with
the
harvest
dig
ponds
and
ditches
but
disliked
them
for
their
boorishness
prince
andrew
last
stay
bogucharovo
when
introduced
hospitals
and
schools
and
reduced
the
quitrent
the
peasants

pay
had
not
softened
their
disposition
but
had
the
contrary
strengthened
them
the
traits

the
old
prince
called
boorishness
various
obscure
rumors
were
always
current
among
them
one
time
rumor
that
they
would

their

with

and
pure

the
vicinity
bogucharovo
were
large
villages
belonging
the
crown
owners
whose
serfs
paid
quitrent
and
could
work
where
they
pleased
there
were
very
few
resident
landlords
the

and
also
very
few

those
parts
the
mysterious
undercurrents
the
life
the
russian
people
the
causes
and
meaning
which
are
baffling
contemporaries
were
more
clearly
and
strongly
noticeable
than
among
others
one
instance
which
had
occurred
some
twenty
years
before
was
movement
among
the
peasants
emigrate
some
unknown
warm
rivers
hundreds
peasants
among
them
the
bogucharovo
folk
suddenly
began
selling
their
cattle
and
moving
whole
families
toward
the
southeast

with

been
they
set
off

were
punished
some

many
died

and
hunger
the
road
many
returned
their
own
accord
and
the
movement
died
down
itself
just
had
sprung
without
apparent
reason
but
such
undercurrents
still
existed
among
the
people
and
gathered
new
forces
ready
manifest
themselves
just
strangely
unexpectedly
and
the
same
time
simply
naturally
and
forcibly
now
anyone
living
close
touch
with
these
people
was
apparent
that
these
undercurrents
were
acting
strongly
and
nearing
eruption
alpatych
who
had
reached
bogucharovo
shortly
before
the
old
prince
death
noticed
agitation
among
the
peasants
and
that
contrary
what
was
happening
the
bald
hills

where
over
radius
forty
miles
all
the
peasants
were
moving
away
and
leaving
their
villages
devastated
the
cossacks
the
peasants

round
bogucharovo
were
was
rumored

with
the
french
received
leaflets
from
them
that
passed
from
hand
hand
and
did
not
migrate
learned
from
domestic
serfs
loyal
him
that
the
peasant
karp
who
possessed
great
influence
the
village
commune
and
had
recently
been
away
driving
government
transport
had
returned
with
news
that
the
cossacks
were
destroying
deserted
villages
but
that
the
french
did
not
harm
them
alpatych
also
knew
that
the
previous
day
another
peasant
had
even
brought
from
the
village
visloukhovo
which
was
occupied
the
french
proclamation
french
general
that
harm
would
done
the
inhabitants
and
they
remained
they
would

had
brought
from
visloukhovo
hundred
rubles

not
know
that
they
were
false
paid
him

for

more
important
still
alpatych
learned
that
the
morning
the
very
day
gave
the
village
elder
orders
collect
carts
move
the
princess
luggage
from
bogucharovo
there
had
been
village
meeting
which
had
been
decided
not
move
but
wait
yet
there
was
time
waste
the
fifteenth
the
day
the
old
prince
death
the
marshal
had
insisted
princess
mary
leaving
once
was
becoming
dangerous
had
told
her
that
after
the
sixteenth
could
not
responsible
for
what
might
happen
the
evening
the
day
the
old
prince
died
the
marshal
went
away
promising
return
next
day
for
the
funeral
but
this
was
unable
for
received
tidings
that
the
french
had
unexpectedly
advanced
and
had
barely
time
remove
his
own
family
and
valuables
from
his
estate
for
some
thirty
years
bogucharovo
had
been
managed
the
village
elder
dron
whom
the
old
prince
called
the
diminutive
dronushka
dron
was
one
those
physically
and
mentally
vigorous
peasants
who
grow
big
beards
soon
they
are
age
and
unchanged
till
they
are
sixty
seventy
without
gray
hair
the
loss
tooth
straight
and
strong
sixty
thirty
soon
after
the
migration
the
warm
rivers
which
had
taken
part
like
the
rest
dron
was
made
village
elder
and
overseer
bogucharovo
and
had
since
filled
that
post
irreproachably
for
twenty
three
years
the
peasants
feared
him
more
than
they
did
their
master
the
masters
both
the
old
prince
and
the
young
and
the
steward
respected
him
and
jestingly
called
him
the
minister
during
the
whole
time
his
service
dron
had
never
been
drunk
ill
never
after
sleepless
nights
the
hardest
tasks
had
shown
the
least
fatigue
and
though
could
not
read
had
never
forgotten
single
money
account
the
number
quarters
flour
any
the
endless
cartloads
sold
for
the
prince
nor
single
shock
the
whole
corn
crop
any
single
acre
the
bogucharovo
fields
alpatych
arriving
from
the
devastated
bald
hills
estate
sent
for
his
dron
the
day
the
prince
funeral
and
told
him
have
twelve
horses
got
ready
for
the
princess
carriages
and
eighteen
carts
for
the
things
removed
from
bogucharovo
though
the
peasants
paid
quitrent
alpatych
thought
difficulty
would
made
about
complying
with
this
order
for
there
were
two
hundred
and
thirty
households
work
bogucharovo
and
the
peasants
were
well
but
hearing
the
order
dron
lowered
his
eyes
and
remained
silent
alpatych
named
certain
peasants
knew
from
whom
told
him
take
the
carts
dron
replied
that
the
horses
these
peasants
were
away
carting
alpatych
named
others
but
they
too
according
dron
had
horses
available
some
horses
were
carting
for
the
government
others
were
too
weak
and
others
had
died
for
want
fodder
seemed
that
horses
could
had
even
for
the
carriages
much
less
for
the
carting
alpatych
looked
intently
dron
and
frowned
just
dron
was
model
village
elder
alpatych
had
not
managed
the
prince
estates
for
twenty
years
vain
was
model
steward
possessing
the
highest
degree
the
faculty
divining
the
needs
and
instincts
those
dealt
with
having
glanced
dron
once
understood
that
his
answers
did
not
express
his
personal
views
but
the
general
mood
the
bogucharovo
commune
which
the
elder
had
already
been
carried
away
but
also
knew
that
dron
who
had
acquired
property
and
was
hated
the
commune
must
hesitating
between
the
two
camps
the
masters
and
the
serfs
noticed
this
hesitation
dron
look
and
therefore
frowned
and
moved
closer
him
now
just
listen
dronushka
said
don
talk
nonsense
his
excellency
prince
andrew
himself
gave
orders
move
all
the
people
away
and
not
leave
them
with
the
enemy
and
there
order
from
the
tsar
about
too
anyone
who
stays
traitor
the
tsar
you
hear
hear
dron
answered
without
lifting
his
eyes
alpatych
was
not
satisfied
with
this
reply
dron
will
turn
out
badly
said
shaking
his
head
the
power
your
hands
dron
rejoined
sadly
dron
drop
alpatych
repeated
withdrawing
his
hand
from
his
bosom
and
solemnly
pointing
the
floor
dron
feet
can
see
through
you
and
three
yards
into
the
ground
under
you
continued
gazing
the
floor
front
dron
dron
was
disconcerted
glanced
furtively
alpatych
and
again
lowered
his
eyes
you
drop
this
nonsense
and
tell
the
people
get
ready
leave
their
homes
and
moscow
and
get
carts
ready
for
tomorrow
morning
for
the
princess

and
don
any

dron
suddenly
fell

knees

the
keys
from

cried
alpatych
sternly

three

the

that

been
able

the
old

for
twenty
years

long
since

him
the
reputation

and
that
the

dron
got
and
was
about
say
something
but
alpatych
interrupted
him
what
you
have
got
into
your
heads
what
are
you
thinking
what
with
the
people

dron
they
quite
beside

abruptly
quite
beside

officer
and
you

and
that
they
must

and

alpatych
did
not
insist
further
had
managed
people
for
long
time
and
knew
that
the
chief
way
make
them
obey
show
suspicion
that
they
can
possibly
disobey
having
wrung
submissive
understand
from
dron
alpatych
contented
himself
with
that
though
not
only
doubted
but
felt
almost
certain
that
without
the
help
troops
the
carts
would
not
forthcoming
and
was
for
when
evening
came
carts
had
been
provided
the
village
outside
the
drink
shop
another
meeting
was
being
held
which
decided
that
the
horses
should
driven
out
into
the
woods
and
the
carts
should
not
provided
without
saying
anything
this
the
princess
alpatych
had
his
own
belongings
taken
out
the
carts
which
had
arrived
from
bald
hills
and
had
those
horses
got
ready
for
the
princess
carriages
meanwhile
went
himself
the
police
authorities
chapter
after
her
father
funeral
princess
mary
shut
herself
her
room
and
did
not
admit
anyone
maid
came
the
door
say
that
alpatych
was
asking
for
orders
about
their
departure
this
was
before
his
talk
with
dron
princess
mary
raised
herself
the
sofa
which
she
had
been
lying
and
replied
through
the
closed
door
that
she
did
not
mean
away
and
begged
left
peace
the
windows
the
room
which
she
was
lying
looked
westward
she
lay
the
sofa
with
her
face
the
wall
fingering
the
buttons
the
leather
cushion
and
seeing
nothing
but
that
cushion
and
her
confused
thoughts
were
centered
one
subject
the
irrevocability
death
and
her
own
spiritual
baseness
which
she
had
not
suspected
but
which
had
shown
itself
during
her
father
illness
she
wished
pray
but
did
not
dare
dared
not
her
present
state
mind
address
herself
god
she
lay
for
long
time
that
position
the
sun
had
reached
the
other
side
the
house
and
its
slanting
rays
shone
into
the
open
window
lighting
the
room
and
part
the
morocco
cushion
which
princess
mary
was
looking
the
flow
her
thoughts
suddenly
stopped
unconsciously
she
sat
smoothed
her
hair
got
and
went
the
window
involuntarily
inhaling
the
freshness
the
clear
but
windy
evening
yes
you
can
well
enjoy
the
evening
now
gone
and
one
will
hinder
you
she
said
herself
and
sinking
into
chair
she
let
her
head
fall
the
window
sill
someone
spoke
her
name
soft
and
tender
voice
from
the
garden
and
kissed
her
head
she
looked
was
mademoiselle
bourienne
black
dress
and
weepers
she
softly
approached
princess
mary
sighed
kissed
her
and
immediately
began
cry
the
princess
looked
her
all
their
former
disharmony
and
her
own
jealousy
recurred
her
mind
but
she
remembered
too
how
had
changed
late
toward
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
could
not
bear
see
her
thereby
showing
how
unjust
were
the
reproaches
princess
mary
had
mentally
addressed
her
besides
for
for
who
desired
his
death
condemn
anyone
she
thought
princess
mary
vividly
pictured
herself
the
position
mademoiselle
bourienne
whom
she
had
late
kept
distance
but
who
yet
was
dependent
her
and
living
her
house
she
felt
sorry
for
her
and
held
out
her
hand
with
glance
gentle
inquiry
mademoiselle
bourienne
once
began
crying
again
and
kissed
that
hand
speaking
the
princess
sorrow
and
making
herself
partner
she
said
her
only
consolation
was
the
fact
that
the
princess
allowed
her
share
her
sorrow
that
all
the
old
misunderstandings
should
sink
into
nothing
but
this
great
grief
that
she
felt
herself
blameless
regard
everyone
and
that
from
above
saw
her
affection
and
gratitude
the
princess
heard
her
not
heeding
her
words
but
occasionally
looking
her
and
listening
the
sound
her
voice
your
position
doubly
terrible
dear
princess
said
mademoiselle
bourienne
after
pause
understand
that

cannot
think
yourself
but

love
for
you
must
has
alpatych
been

she
asked
princess
mary
did
not
answer
she
did
not
understand
who
was
where
possible
plan
think
anything
now
not
all
the
same
she
thought
and
did
not
reply
you

said
mademoiselle
bourienne
that

french
would
dangerous

and
god
knows
princess
mary
looked
her
companion
without
understanding
what
she
was
talking
about
anyone
knew
how
little
anything
matters
now
she
said
course
would
account
wish
away
from
him
alpatych
did
say
something
about
going
speak
him
can
nothing
nothing
and
don
want

him
hopes

time
get
away
tomorrow
but
think

said
mademoiselle
bourienne
because
you
will
agree
chere
marie
fall
into
the
hands
the
soldiers
riotous
peasants
would
terrible
mademoiselle
bourienne
took
from
her
reticule
proclamation
not
printed
ordinary
russian
paper
general
rameau
telling
people
not
leave
their
homes
and
that
the
french
authorities
would
afford
them
proper
protection
she
handed
this
the
princess
think
would
best
appeal
that
general
she
continued
and
sure
that
all
due
respect
would
shown
you
princess
mary
read
the
paper
and
her
face
began
quiver
with
stifled
sobs
from
whom
did
you
get
this
she
asked
they
probably
recognized
that
french
name
replied
mademoiselle
bourienne
blushing
princess
mary
with
the
paper
her
hand
rose
from
the
window
and
with
pale
face
went
out
the
room
and
into
what
had
been
prince
andrew
study
dunyasha
send
alpatych
dronushka
somebody
she
said
and
tell
mademoiselle
bourienne
not
come
she
added
hearing
mademoiselle
bourienne
voice
must
once
once
she
said
appalled
the
thought
being
left
the
hands
the
french
prince
andrew
heard
that
was
the
power
the
french
that
the
daughter
prince
nicholas
bolkonski
asked
general
rameau
for
protection
and
accepted
his
favor
this
idea
horrified
her
made
her
shudder
blush
and
feel
such
rush
anger
and
pride
she
had
never
experienced
before
all
that
was
distressing
and
especially
all
that
was
humiliating
her
position
rose
vividly
her
mind
they
the
french
would
settle
this
house
general
rameau
would
occupy
prince
andrew
study
and
amuse
himself
looking
through
and
reading
his
letters
and
papers
mademoiselle
bourienne
would
the
honors
bogucharovo
for
him
should
given
small
room
favor
the
soldiers
would
violate
father
newly
dug
grave
steal
his
crosses
and
stars
they
would
tell
their
victories
over
the
russians
and
would
pretend
sympathize
with
sorrow
thought
princess
mary
not
thinking
her
own
thoughts
but
feeling
bound
think
like
her
father
and
her
brother
for
herself
she
did
not
care
where
she
remained
what
happened
her
but
she
felt
herself
the
representative
her
dead
father
and
prince
andrew
involuntarily
she
thought
their
thoughts
and
felt
their
feelings
what
they
would
have
said
and
what
they
would
have
done
she
felt
bound
say
and
she
went
into
prince
andrew
study
trying
enter
completely
into
his
ideas
and
considered
her
position
the
demands
life
which
had
seemed
her
annihilated
her
father
death
all
once
rose
before
her
with
new
previously
unknown
force
and
took
possession
her
agitated
and
flushed
she
paced
the
room
sending
now
for
michael
ivanovich
and
now
for
tikhon
dron
dunyasha
the
nurse
and
the
other
maids
could
not
say
how
far
mademoiselle
bourienne
statement
was
correct
alpatych
was
not
home
had
gone
the
police
neither
could
the
architect
michael
ivanovich
who
being
sent
for
came
with
sleepy
eyes
tell
princess
mary
anything
with
just
the
same
smile
agreement
with
which
for
fifteen
years
had
been
accustomed
answer
the
old
prince
without
expressing
views
his
own
now
replied
princess
mary
that
nothing
definite
could
got
from
his
answers
the
old
valet
tikhon
with
sunken
emaciated
face
that
bore
the
stamp
inconsolable
grief
replied
yes

questions
and
hardly
refrained
from
sobbing
looked

length
dron
the
village

entered
the
room
and
with
deep
bow
princess
mary
came

princess

walked
and
down
the
room
and
stopped

began
but

with
sigh
they
were

for
while

when
such
sorrow
was
filling
her
soul
there
could
rich
people
and
poor
and
the
rich
could
refrain
from
helping
the
poor
she
had
heard
vaguely
that
there
was
such
thing

which
was
sometimes
given
the
peasants
she
also
knew
that
neither
her
father
nor
her

would
refuse
help
the
peasants
need
she
only
feared
make
some
mistake
speaking
about
the
distribution
the
grain
she
wished
give
she
was
glad
such
cares
presented
themselves
enabling
her
without
scruple
forget
her
own
grief

began
asking

about
the
peasants
needs

was

replied
that

had
never
doubted
his
devotion
and
that
she
was
ready

and
for
the
peasants
chapter
hour
later
dunyasha
came

the
princess
that

all
the
peasants
had
assembled

barn

protests
she
went
out
into
the
porch
dron
dunyasha
the
nurse
and
michael
ivanovich
following
her
they
probably
think
offering

the
grain
bribe

away

french
thought
princess
mary

moscow
estate

she
thought
she
went
out
the
twilight
toward
the
crowd
standing
the
pasture
the
barn
the
men
crowded
closer
together
stirred
and
rapidly
took
off
their
hats
princess
mary
lowered
her
eyes
and
tripping
over
her
skirt
came
close
them
many
different
eyes
old
and
young
were
fixed
her
and
there
were
many
different
faces
that
she
could
not
distinguish
any
them
and
feeling
that
she
must
speak
them
all
once
did
not
know
how
but
again
the
sense
that
she
represented
her
father
and
her
brother
gave
her
courage
and
she
boldly
began
her
speech
very
glad
you
have
come
she
said
without
raising
her
eyes
and
feeling
her
heart
beating
quickly
and
violently
dronushka
tells
that
the
war
has
ruined
you
that
our
common
misfortune
and
shall
grudge
nothing
help

myself
going

promise

the
princess
stopped
sighs
were
the
only
sound
heard
the
crowd
not
doing
this
own
account
she
continued
the
name
dead
father
who
was
good
master
you
and
brother
and
his
son
again
she
paused
one
broke
the
silence
ours
common
misfortune
and
will
share
together
all
that
mine
yours
she
concluded
scanning
the
faces
before
her
all
eyes
were
gazing
her
with
one
and
the
same
expression
she
could
not
fathom
whether
was
curiosity
devotion
gratitude
apprehension
and
distrust
but
the
expression
all
the
faces
was
identical
are
all
very
thankful
for
your
bounty
but
won
for
take
the
landlord
grain
said
voice
the
back
the
crowd
but
why
not
asked
the
princess
one
replied
and
princess
mary
looking
round
the
crowd
found
that
every
eye
she
met
now
was
immediately
dropped
but
why
don
you
want
take
she
asked
again
one
answered
the
silence
began
oppress
the
princess
and
she
tried
catch
someone
eye
why
don
you
speak
she
inquired
very
old
man
who
stood
just
front
her
leaning
his
stick
you
think
something
more
wanted
tell
will
anything
said
she
catching
his
eye
but
this
angered
him
bent
his
head
quite
low
and
muttered
why
should
agree
don
want
the
grain
why
should
give
everything
don
agree
don
agree
are
sorry
for
you
but
not
willing
away
yourself
alone
came
from
various
sides
the
crowd
and
again
all
the
faces
that
crowd
bore
identical
expression
though
now
was
certainly
not
expression
curiosity
gratitude
but
angry
resolve
but
you
can
have
understood
said
princess
mary
with
sad
smile
why
don
you
want
promise
house
and
feed
you
while
here
the
enemy
would
ruin
you
but
her
voice
was
drowned

voices
the
crowd
not
willing
let
them
ruin
won
take
your
grain

agree
again
princess
mary
tried
catch
someone
eye
but
not
single
eye
the
crowd
was
turned

they
were
all
trying
avoid
her
look
she
felt
strange
and
awkward

down
your
houses

into

crowd
were
heard
saying
with
drooping
head
princess
mary
left
the
crowd
and
went
back
the
house
having
repeated
her
order
dron
have
horses
ready
for
her
departure
next
morning
she
went
her
room
and
remained
alone
with
her
own
thoughts
chapter
xii
for
long
time
that
night
princess
mary
sat
the
open
window
her
room
hearing
the
sound
the
peasants
voices
that
reached
her
from
the
village
but
was
not
them
she
was
thinking
she
felt
that
she
could
not
understand
them
however
much
she
might
think
about
them
she
thought
only
one
thing
her
sorrow
which
after
the
break
caused
cares
for
the
present
seemed
already
belong
the
past
now
she
could
remember
and
weep
pray
after
sunset
the
wind
had
dropped
the
night
was
calm
and
fresh
toward
midnight
the
voices
began
subside
cock
crowed
the
full
moon
began
show
from
behind
the
lime
trees
fresh
white
dewy
mist
began
rise
and
stillness
reigned
over
the
village
and
the
house
pictures
the
near
past
her
father
illness
and
last
moments
rose
one
after
another
her
memory
with
mournful
pleasure
she
now
lingered
over
these
images
repelling
with
horror
only
the
last
one
the
picture
his
death
which
she
felt
she
could
not
contemplate
even
imagination
this
still
and
mystic
hour
night
and
these
pictures
presented
themselves
her
clearly
and
such
detail
that
they
seemed
now
present
now
past
and
now
future
she
vividly
recalled
the
moment
when
had
his
first
stroke
and
was
being
dragged
along
his
armpits
through
the
garden
bald
hills
muttering
something
with
his
helpless
tongue
twitching
his
gray
eyebrows
and
looking
uneasily
and
timidly
her
even
then
wanted
tell
what
told
the
day
died
she
thought
had
always
thought
what
said
then
and
she
recalled
all
its
detail
the
night
bald
hills
before
had
the
last
stroke
when
with
foreboding
disaster
she
had
remained
home
against
his
will
she
had
not
slept
and
had
stolen
downstairs
tiptoe
and
going
the
door
the
conservatory
where
slept
that
night
had
listened
the
door
suffering
and
weary
voice
was
saying
something
tikhon
speaking
the
crimea
and
its
warm
nights
and
the
empress
evidently
had
wanted
talk
and
why
didn
call
why
didn
let
there
instead
tikhon
princess
mary
had
thought
and
thought
again
now
now
will
never
tell
anyone
what
had
his
soul
never
will
that
moment
return
for
him
for
when
might
have
said
all
longed
say
and
not
tikhon
but
might
have
heard
and
understood
him
why
didn
enter
the
room
she
thought
perhaps
would
then
have
said
what
said
the
day
died
while
talking
tikhon
asked
about
twice
wanted
see
and
was
standing
close
outside
the
door
was
sad
and
painful
for
him
talk
tikhon
who
did
not
understand
him
remember
how
began
speaking
him
about
lise
she
were
alive
had
forgotten
she
was
dead
and
tikhon
reminded
him
that
she
was
more
and
shouted
fool
was
greatly
depressed
from
behind
the
door
heard
how
lay
down
his
bed
groaning
and
loudly
exclaimed
god
why
didn
then
what
could
have
done
what
could
have
lost
and
perhaps
would
then
have
been
comforted
and
would
have
said
that
word
and
princess
mary
uttered
aloud
the
caressing
word
had
said
her
the
day
his
death
dear
est
she
repeated
and
began
sobbing
with
tears
that
relieved
her
soul
she
now
saw
his
face
before
her
and
not
the
face
she
had
known
ever
since
she
could
remember
and
had
always
seen
distance
but
the
timid
feeble
face
she
had
seen
for
the
first
time
quite
closely
with
all
its
wrinkles
and
details
when
she
stooped
near
his
mouth
catch
what
said
dear
est
she
repeated
again
what
was
thinking
when
uttered
that
word
what
thinking
now
this
question
suddenly
presented
itself
her
and
answer
she
saw
him
before
her
with
the
expression
that
was
his
face
lay
his
coffin
with
his
chin
bound
with
white
handkerchief
and
the
horror
that
had
seized
her
when
she
touched
him
and
convinced
herself
that
that
was
not
but
something
mysterious
and
horrible
seized
her
again
she
tried
think
something
else
and
pray
but
could
neither
with
wide
open
eyes
she
gazed
the
moonlight
and
the
shadows
expecting
every
moment
see
his
dead
face
and
she
felt
that
the
silence
brooding
over
the
house
and
within
held
her
fast
dunyasha
she
whispered
dunyasha
she
screamed
wildly
and
tearing
herself
out
this
silence
she
ran
the
servants
quarters
meet
her
old
nurse
and
the
maidservants
who
came
running
toward
her

said
alpatych
rostov
dismounted
gave
his
horse
the
orderly
and
followed
alpatych
the
house
questioning
him
the
state
affairs
appeared
that
the
princess
offer
corn
the
peasants
the
previous
day
and
her
talk
with
dron
and
the
meeting
had
actually
had
bad
effect
that
dron
had
finally
given
the
keys
and
joined
the
peasants
and
had
not
appeared
when
alpatych
sent
for
him
and
that
the
morning
when
the
princess
gave
orders
harness
for
her
journey
the
peasants
had
come
large
crowd
the
barn
and
sent
word
that
they
would
not
let
her
leave
the
village
that
there
was
order
not
move
and
that
they
would
unharness
the
horses
alpatych
had
gone
out
admonish
them
but
was
told
was
chiefly
karp
who
did
the
talking
dron
not
showing
himself
the
crowd
that
they
could
not
let
the
princess
that
there
was
order
the
contrary
but
that
she
stayed
they
would
serve
her
before
and
obey
her
everything
the
moment
when
rostov
and
ilyin
were
galloping
along
the
road
princess
mary
despite
the
dissuasions
alpatych
her
nurse
and
the
maids
had
given
orders
harness
and
intended
start
but
when
the
cavalrymen
were
espied
they
were
taken
for
frenchmen
the
coachman
ran
away
and
the
women
the
house
began
wail

sent
you
exclaimed
deeply
moved
voices
rostov
passed
through
the
anteroom
princess
mary
was
sitting
helpless
and
bewildered
the
large
sitting
room
when
rostov
was
shown
she
could
not
grasp
who
was
and
why
had
come
what
was
happening
her
when
she
saw
his
russian
face
and
his
walk
and
the
first
words
uttered
recognized
him
man
her
own
class
she
glanced
him
with
her
deep
radiant
look
and
began
speaking
voice
that
faltered
and
trembled
with
emotion
this
meeting
immediately
struck
rostov
romantic

helpless
girl
overwhelmed
with
grief
left
the
mercy
coarse
rioting
peasants
and
what
strange
fate
sent
here
what
gentleness
and
nobility
there
are
her
features
and
expression
thought
looked
her
and
listened
her
timid
story
when
she
began
tell
him
that
all
this
had
happened
the
day
after
her
father
funeral
her
voice
trembled
she
turned
away
and
then
fearing
might
take
her
words
meant
move
him
pity
looked
him
with
apprehensive
glance
inquiry
there
were
tears
rostov
eyes
princess
mary
noticed
this
and
glanced
gratefully
him
with
that
radiant
look
which
caused
the
plainness
her
face
forgotten
cannot
express
princess
how
glad
that
happened
ride
here
and
able
show
readiness
serve
you
said
rostov
rising
when
you
please
and
give
you

honor
that
one
shall
dare
cause
you
annoyance
only
you
will
allow

escort
and
bowing
respectfully
lady

moved
toward
the
door
rostov
deferential
tone
seemed
indicate
that
though
would
consider
himself
happy
acquainted
with
her
did
not
wish
take
advantage
her
misfortunes
intrude
upon
her
princess
mary
understood
this
and
appreciated
his
delicacy
very
very
grateful
you
she
said
french
but
hope
was
all
misunderstanding
and
that
one
blame
for
she
suddenly
began
cry
excuse
she
said
rostov
knitting
his
brows
left
the
room
with
another
low
bow
chapter

well
she
pretty
friend

one
delicious
her

dunyasha
but
glancing
rostov
face
ilyin
stopped
short
saw
that
his
hero
and
commander
was
following
quite
different
train
thought
rostov
glanced
angrily
ilyin
and
without
replying
strode
off
with
rapid
steps
the
village
show
them
give
them
the
brigands
said
himself
alpatych
gliding
trot
only
just
managing
not
run
kept
with
him
with
difficulty
what
decision
have
you
been
pleased
come
said
rostov
stopped
and
clenching
his
fists
suddenly
and
sternly
turned
alpatych
decision
what
decision
old
dotard
cried
what
have
you
been
about
the
peasants
are
rioting
and
you
can
manage
them
you
traitor
yourself
know
you
flay
you
all
alive
and
afraid
wasting
his
store
anger
left
alpatych
and
went
rapidly
forward
alpatych
mastering
his
offended
feelings
kept
pace
with
rostov
gliding
gait
and
continued
impart
his
views
said
the
peasants
were
obdurate
and
that
the
present
moment
would
imprudent
overresist
them
without
armed
force
and
would
not
better
first
send
for
the
military
give
them
armed
force
overresist
them
uttered
rostov
meaninglessly
breathless
with
irrational
animal
fury
and
the
need
vent
without
considering
what
would
moved
unconciously
with
quick
resolute
steps
toward
the
crowd
and
the
nearer
drew
the
more
alpatych
felt
that
this
unreasonable
action
might
produce
good
results
the
peasants
the
crowd
were
similarly
impressed
when
they
saw
rostov
rapid
firm
steps
and
resolute
frowning
face
after
the
hussars
had
come
the
village
and
rostov
had
gone
see
the
princess
certain
confusion
and
dissension
had
arisen
among
the
crowd
some
the
peasants
said
that
these
new
arrivals
were
russians
and
might
take
amiss
that
the
mistress
was
being
detained
dron
was
this
opinion
but
soon
expressed
karp
and
others
attacked
their
elder
how
many
years
have
you
been
fattening
the

shouted
him
all

and
that

that
all
about

another
was
your
son

conscripted
but
fear
you
begrudged
your
lump
son
little
old
man
suddenly
began
attacking
dron
and
they
took
vanka
shaved
for
soldier
but
all

die
not
against
the
commune
said
dron
that
not
against

filled
your
belly
the
two
tall
peasants
had
their
say
soon
rostov
followed
ilyin
lavrushka
and
alpatych
came
the
crowd
karp
thrusting
his
fingers
into
his
belt
and
smiling
little
walked
the
front
dron
the
contrary
retired
the
rear
and
the
crowd
drew
closer
together
who

elder
here

shouted
rostov
coming
the
crowd
with
quick
steps
the
elder
what
you
want
with
him
asked
karp
but
before
the
words
were
well
out
his
mouth
his
cap
flew
off
and
fierce
blow
jerked
his
head
one
side
caps
off

shouted
rostov
wrathful
voice
where
the
elder
cried
furiously

meek
and
flustered
voices
here
and
there
were
heard
calling
and

come
off
their
heads

following
the
orders
declared
karp
and
that
moment
several
voices
began
speaking
together

and
ordered

the
men
obediently
came
out

crowd
and
began
taking
off
their
belts
where
the

demanded
rostov

voice
with
pale
and
frowning
face
dron
stepped
out
the
crowd

lavrushka
shouted
rostov
that
order
too
could
not
possibly
meet
with
any
opposition
and
fact
two
more
peasants
began
binding
dron
who
took
off
his
own
belt
and
handed
them

rostov

alpatych
coming
into
his

again

all
our
stupidity
yakov
alpatych
came
the
answers
and
the
crowd
began
once
disperse
through
the
village
the
two
bound
men
were
led
off
the
master
house
the
two
drunken
peasants
followed
them
aye
when

the
other

two
hours
later
the
carts
were
standing
the
courtyard
the
bogucharovo
house
the
peasants
were
briskly

the

rostov
did
not
back
the

but
remained
the

awaiting
her
departure
when
her
carriage
drove
out

and
accompanied
her
eight
miles
from
bogucharovo
where
the

was
occupied
our

the

respectfully
took
leave
her
for
the

make
blush
please
don

but
the
princess
she
did
not
again
thank
him
words
thanked
him
with
the
whole
expression
her
face
radiant
with
gratitude
and
tenderness
she
could
not
believe
that
there
was
nothing
thank
him
for
the
contrary
seemed
her
certain
that
had
not
been
there
she
would
have
perished
the
hands
the
mutineers
and
the
french
and
that
had
exposed
himself
terrible
and
obvious
danger
save
her
and
even
more
certain
was
that
was
man
lofty
and
noble
soul
able
understand
her
position
and
her
sorrow
his
kind
honest
eyes
with
the
tears
rising
them
when
she
herself
had
begun
cry
she
spoke
her
loss
did
not
leave
her
memory
when
she
had
taken
leave
him
and
remained
alone
she
suddenly
felt
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
and
then
not
for
the
first
time
the
strange
question
presented
itself
her
did
she
love
him
the
rest
the
way
moscow
though
the
princess
position
was
not
cheerful
one
dunyasha
who
went
with
her
the
carriage
more
than
once
noticed
that
her
mistress
leaned
out
the
window
and
smiled
something
with
expression
mingled
joy
and
sorrow
well
supposing
love
him
thought
princess
mary
ashamed
she
was
acknowledging
herself
that
she
had
fallen
love
with
man
who
would
perhaps
never
love
her
she
comforted
herself
with
the
thought
that
one
would
ever
know
and
that
she
would
not
blame
without
ever
speaking
anyone
she
continued
the
end
her
life
love
the
man
with
whom
she
had
fallen
love
for
the
first
and
last
time
her
life
sometimes
when
she
recalled
his
looks
his
sympathy
and
his
words
happiness
did
not
appear
impossible
her
was
those
moments
that
dunyasha
noticed
her
smiling
she
looked
out
the
carriage
window
was
not
fate
that
brought
him
bogucharovo
and
that
very
moment
thought
princess
mary
and
that
caused
his
sister
refuse
brother
and
all
this
princess
mary
saw
the
hand
providence
the
impression
the
princess
made
rostov
was
very
agreeable
one
remember
her
gave
him
pleasure
and
when
his
comrades
hearing
his
adventure
bogucharovo
rallied
him
having
gone
look
for
hay
and
having
picked
one
the
wealthiest
heiresses
russia
grew
angry
made
him
angry
just
because
the
idea
marrying
the
gentle
princess
mary
who
was
attractive
him
and
had
enormous
fortune
had
against
his
will
more
than
once
entered
his
head
for
himself
personally
nicholas
could
not
wish
for
better
wife
marrying
her
would
make
the
countess
his
mother
happy
would
able
put
his
father
affairs
order
and
would
even
felt
ensure
princess
mary
happiness
but
sonya
and
his
plighted
word
that
was
why
rostov
grew
angry

prince
andrew
knew
denisov
from
what
natasha
had
told
him
her
first
suitor
this
memory
carried
him
sadly
and
sweetly
back
those
painful
feelings
which
had
not
thought
lately
but
which
still
found
place
his
soul
late
had
received
many
new
and
very
serious
impressions
such
the
retreat
from
smolensk
his
visit
bald
hills
and
the
recent
news
his
father
death
and
had
experienced
many
emotions
that
for
long
time
past
those
memories
had
not
entered
his
mind
and
now
that
they
did
they
did
not
act
him
with
nearly
their
former
strength
for
denisov
too
the
memories
awakened
the

romantic
past
when
after

after

without
realizing
what
was
doing
smiled
the
recollection
that
time

his

interested
him
passionately

exclusively
this

devised
while
serving
the
outposts
during
the
retreat
had
proposed
that
plan
barclay
tolly
and
now
wished
propose
kutuzov
the
plan
was
based
the
fact
that
the
french
line
operation
was
too
extended
and
proposed
that
instead
concurrently
with
action
the
front
bar
the
advance
the
french
should
attack
their
line

began
explaining
his
plan

and
began
gesticulating
explained
his

bolkonski
the
midst
his
explanation
shouts
were
heard
from
the
army
growing
more
incoherent
and
more
diffused
mingling
with
music
and
songs
and
coming
from
the
field
where
the
review
was
held
sounds
hoofs
and
shouts
were
nearing
the

cossack
standing

they

coming
down
the
street
mounted
rather
small

huge

generals
rode
behind
him
barclay
was
riding
almost
beside
him
and
crowd
officers
ran
after
and
around
them
shouting
hurrah
his
adjutants
galloped
into
the
yard
before
him
kutuzov
was
impatiently
urging
his
horse
which
ambled
smoothly
under
his
weight
and
raised
his
hand
his
white
horse

with
red
band
and

nodding
his
head
continually
when
came
the
guard

fine
set
grenadiers
mostly
wearing
decorations
who
were
giving
him
the
salute
looked
them
silently
and
attentively
for
nearly
minute
with
the
steady
gaze
commander
and
then
turned
the
crowd
generals
and
officers
surrounding
him
suddenly
his
face
assumed
subtle
expression
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
air
perplexity
and
with
such
fine
fellows
retreat
and
retreat
well
good
general
added
and
rode
into
the
yard
past
prince
andrew
and
denisov
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
shouted
those
behind
him
since
prince
andrew
had
last
seen
him
kutuzov
had
grown
still
more
corpulent
flaccid
and
fat
but
the
bleached
eyeball
the
scar
and
the
familiar
weariness
his
expression
were
still
the
same
was
wearing
the
white
horse
guard
cap
and
military
overcoat
with
whip
hanging
over
his
shoulder

strap
sat
heavily
and
swayed
limply
his
brisk
little
horse
whew

just
audibly
rode
into
the
yard
his

expressed
the
relief
relaxed

felt
man
who
means

after

drew
his
left
foot
out
the
stirrup
and
lurching
with
his
whole
body
and
puckering
his
face
with
the
effort
raised
with
difficulty
onto
the
saddle
leaned
his
knee
groaned
and
slipped
down
into
the
arms
the
cossacks
and
adjutants
who
stood
ready
assist
him
pulled
himself
together
looked
round
screwing
his
eyes
glanced
prince
andrew
and
evidently
not
recognizing
him
moved
with
his
waddling
gait
the
porch
whew
whew
whew
whistled
and
again
glanced
prince
andrew
often
occurs
with
old
men
was
only
after
some
seconds
that
the
impression
produced
prince
andrew
face
linked
itself
with
kutuzov
remembrance
his
personality
how
you
dear
prince
how
you
dear
boy
come
along
said
glancing
wearily
round
and
stepped
onto
the
porch
which
creaked
under
his
weight
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
sat
down
bench
the
porch
and
how
your
father
received
news
his
death
yesterday
replied
prince
andrew
abruptly
kutuzov
looked
him
with
eyes
wide
open
with
dismay
and
then
took
off
his
cap
and
crossed
himself
may
the
kingdom
heaven
his
god
will
done
all
sighed
deeply
his
whole
chest
heaving
and
was
silent
for
while
loved
him
and
respected
him
and
sympathize
with
you
with
all
heart
embraced
prince
andrew
pressing
him
his
fat
breast
and
for
some
time
did
not
let
him
when
released
him
prince
andrew
saw
that
kutuzov
flabby
lips
were
trembling
and
that
tears
were
his
eyes
sighed
and
pressed
the
bench
with
both
hands
raise
himself
come
come
with
have
talk
said
but
that
moment
denisov
more
intimidated
his
superiors
than
the
enemy
came
with
jingling
spurs
the
steps
the
porch
despite
the
angry
whispers
the
adjutants
who
tried
stop
him
kutuzov
his
hands
still
pressed
the
seat
glanced
him
glumly
denisov
having
given
his
name
announced
that
had
communicate
his
serene
highness
matter
great
importance
for
their
country
welfare
kutuzov
looked
wearily
him
and
lifting
his
hands
with
gesture
annoyance
folded
them
across
his
stomach
repeating
the
words
for
our
country
welfare
well
what
speak
denisov
blushed
like
girl
was
strange
see
the
color
rise
that
shaggy
bibulous
time
worn
face
and
boldly
began
expound
his
plan
cutting
the
enemy
lines
communication
between
smolensk
and
vyazma
denisov
came
from
those
parts
and
knew
the
country
well
his
plan
seemed
decidedly
good
one
especially
from
the
strength
conviction
with
which
spoke
kutuzov
looked
down
his
own
legs
occasionally
glancing
the
door
the
adjoining
hut
expecting
something
unpleasant
emerge
from
and
from
that
hut
while
denisov
was
speaking
general
with
portfolio
under
his
arm
really
did
appear
what
said
kutuzov
the
midst
denisov
explanations
are
you
ready
soon
ready
your
serene
highness
replied
the
general
kutuzov
swayed
his
head
much
say
how
one
man
deal
with
all
and
again
listened
denisov
give
word
honor
wussian
officer
said
denisov
that
can
bweak
napoleon
line
communication
what
relation
are
you
intendant
general
kiril
andreevich
denisov
asked
kutuzov
interrupting
him
uncle
your
sewene
highness

said
kutuzov
cheerfully
all
right
all
right
friend
stay
here
the
staff
and

talk
with
nod
denisov
turned
away
and
put
out
his
hand
for
the
papers
konovnitsyn
had
brought
him
would
not
your
serene
highness
like
come
inside
said
the
general
duty
discontented
voice
the
plans
must
examined
and
several
papers
have
signed
adjutant
came
out
and
announced
that
everything
was
readiness
within
but
kutuzov
evidently
did
not
wish
enter
that
room
till
was
disengaged
made
grimace
tell
them
bring
small
table
out
here
dear
boy
look
them
here
said
don
away
added
turning
prince
andrew
who
remained
the
porch
and
listened
the
general
report
while
this
was
being
given
prince
andrew
heard
the
whisper
woman
voice
and
the
rustle
silk
dress
behind
the
door
several
times
glancing
that
way
noticed
behind
that
door
plump
rosy
handsome
woman
pink
dress
with
lilac
silk
kerchief
her
head
holding
dish
and
evidently
awaiting
the
entrance
the
commander
chief
kutuzov
adjutant
whispered
prince
andrew
that
this
was
the
wife
the
priest
whose
home
was
and
that
she
intended
offer
his
serene
highness
bread
and
salt
her
husband
has
welcomed
his
serene
highness
with
the
cross
the
church
and
she
intends
welcome
him
the
house
she
very
pretty
added
the
adjutant
with
smile
those
words
kutuzov
looked
round
was
listening
the
general
report
which
consisted
chiefly
criticism
the
position
tsarevo
zaymishche
had
listened
denisov
and
seven
years
previously
had
listened
the
discussion
the
austerlitz
council
war
evidently
listened
only
because
had
ears
which
though
there
was
piece
tow
one
them
could
not
help
hearing
but
was
evident
that
nothing
the
general
could
say
would
surprise
even
interest
him
that
knew
all
that
would
said
beforehand
and
heard
all
only
because
had
one
has
listen
the
chanting
service
prayer
all
that
denisov
had
said
was
clever
and
the
point
what
the
general
was
saying
was
even
more
clever
and
the
point
but
was
evident
that
kutuzov
despised
knowledge
and
cleverness
and
knew
something
else
that
would
decide
the
matter
something
independent
cleverness
and
knowledge
prince
andrew
watched
the
commander
chief
face
attentively
and
the
only
expression
could
see
there
was
one
boredom
curiosity
the
meaning
the
feminine
whispering
behind
the
door
and
desire
observe
propriety
was
evident
that
kutuzov
despised
cleverness
and
learning
and
even
the
patriotic
feeling
shown
denisov
but
despised
them
not
because
his
own
intellect
feelings
knowledge
did
not
try
display
any
these
but
because
something
else
despised
them
because
his
old
age
and
experience
life
the
only
instruction
kutuzov
gave
his
own
accord
during
that
report
referred
looting
the
russian
troops
the
end
the
report
the
general
put
before
him
for
signature
paper
relating
the
recovery
payment
from
army
commanders
for
green
oats
mown
down
the
soldiers
when
landowners
lodged
petitions
for
compensation
after
hearing
the
matter
kutuzov
smacked
his
lips
together
and
shook
his
head
into
the
stove
into
the
fire
with
tell
you
once
for
all
dear
fellow
said
into
the
fire
with
all
such
things
let
them
cut
the
crops
and
burn
wood
their
hearts
content
don
order
allow
but
don
exact
compensation
either
one
can
get
without
when
wood
chopped
the
chips

the

again
this
german
precision
muttered
shaking
his
head
chapter
xvi
well
that
all
said
kutuzov
signed
the
last
the
documents
and
rising
heavily
and
smoothing
out
the
folds
his
fat
white
neck
moved
toward
the
door
with
more
cheerful
expression
the
priest
wife
flushing
rosy
red
caught
the
dish
she
had
after
all
not
managed
present
the
right
moment
though
she
had
long
been
preparing
for
and
with
low
bow
offered
kutuzov
screwed
his
eyes
smiled
lifted
her
chin
with
his
hand
and
said
what
beauty
thank
you
sweetheart
took
some
gold
pieces
from
his
trouser
pocket
and
put
them
the
dish
for
her
well
dear
and
how
are
getting
asked
moving
the
door
the
room
assigned
him
the
priest
wife
smiled
and
with
dimples
her
rosy
cheeks
followed
him
into
the
room
the
adjutant
came
out
the
porch
and
asked
prince
andrew
lunch
with
him
half
hour
later
prince
andrew
was
again
called
kutuzov
found
him
reclining
armchair
still
the
same
unbuttoned
overcoat
had
his
hand
french
book
which
closed
prince
andrew
entered
marking
the
place
with
knife
prince
andrew
saw
the
cover
that
was
les
chevaliers
cygne
madame
genlis
well
sit
down
sit
down
here
let
have
talk
said
kutuzov
sad
very
sad
but
remember
dear
fellow
that
father
you
second
father
prince
andrew
told
kutuzov
all
knew
his
father
death
and
what
had
seen
bald
hills
when
passed
through
what
what
they
have
brought
kutuzov
suddenly
cried
agitated
voice
evidently
picturing
vividly
himself
from
prince
andrew
story
the
condition
russia
was
but
give
time
give
time
said
with
grim
look
evidently
not
wishing
continue
this
agitating
conversation
and
added
sent
for
you
keep
you
with
thank
your
serene
highness
but
fear
longer
fit
for
the
staff
replied
prince
andrew
with
smile
which
kutuzov
noticed
kutuzov
glanced
inquiringly
him
but
above
all
added
prince
andrew
have
grown
used
regiment
fond
the
officers
and
fancy
the
men
also
like
should
sorry
leave
the
regiment
decline
the
honor
being
with
you
believe
shrewd
kindly
yet
subtly
derisive
expression
lit
kutuzov
podgy
face
cut
bolkonski
short
sorry
for
need
you
but
you
right
you
right
not
here
that
men
are
needed
advisers
are
always
plentiful
but
men
are
not
the
regiments
would
not
what
they
are
the
would
advisers
served
there
you
remember
you
austerlitz
remember
yes
remember
you
with
the
standard
said
kutuzov
and
flush
pleasure
suffused
prince
andrew
face
this
recollection
taking
his
hand
and
drawing
him
downwards
kutuzov
offered
his
cheek
kissed
and
again
prince
andrew
noticed
tears
the
old
man
eyes
though
prince
andrew
knew
that
kutuzov
tears
came
easily
and
that
was
particularly
tender
and
considerate
him
from
wish
show
sympathy
with
his
loss
yet
this
reminder
austerlitz
was
both
pleasant
and
flattering
him
your
way
and
god
with
you
know
your
path
the
path
honor
paused
missed
you
bucharest
but
needed
someone
send
and
changing
the
subject
kutuzov
began
speak
the
turkish
war
and
the
peace
that
had
been
concluded
yes
have
been
much
blamed
said
both
for
that
war
and
the
peace
but
everything
came
the
right
time
tout
vient
point
celui
qui
sait
attendre
and
there
were
many
advisers
there
here
went
returning
the
subject
advisers
which
evidently
occupied
him
those
advisers
said
had
listened
them
all
should
not
have
made
peace
with
turkey
and
should
not
have
been
through
with
that
war
everything
haste
but
more
haste
less
speed
kamenski
would
have
been
lost
had
not
died
stormed
fortresses
with
thirty
thousand
men
not
difficult
capture
fortress
but
difficult
win
campaign
for
that
not
storming
and
attacking
but
patience
and
time
are
wanted
kamenski
sent
soldiers
rustchuk
but
only
employed
these
two
things
and
took
more
fortresses
than
kamenski
and
made
them
turks
eat
horseflesh
swayed
his
head
and
the
french
shall
too
believe
went
growing
warmer
and
beating
his
chest
make
them
eat
horseflesh
and
tears
again
dimmed
his
eyes
everything
comes
time
him
who
knows
how
wait
but
shan
have
accept
battle
remarked
prince
andrew
shall
everybody
wants
can
helped
but
believe
dear
boy
there
nothing
stronger
than
those
two
patience
and
time
they
will
all
but
the
advisers
entendent

some
want

others
don

one
asked
evidently
expecting
answer
well
what
you
want
repeated
and
his
eye
shone
with
deep
shrewd
look
tell
you
what
continued
prince
andrew
still
did
not
reply
will
tell
you
what
and
what
dans

mon
cher
paused
abstiens

articulated
the
french
proverb
deliberately
don
see
that
way
that
the
trouble
when
doubt
dear
fellow
nothing
well
good
dear
fellow
remember
that
with
all
heart
share
your
sorrow
and
that
for
you
not
serene
highness
nor
prince
nor
commander
chief
but
father
you
want
anything
come
straight
good
bye
dear
boy
again
embraced
and
kissed
prince
andrew
but
before
the
latter
had
left
the
room
kutuzov
gave
sigh
relief
and
went
with
his
unfinished
novel
les
chevaliers
cygne
madame
genlis
prince
andrew
could
not
have
explained
how
why
was
but
after
that
interview
with
kutuzov
went
back
his
regiment
reassured
the
general
course
affairs
and
the
man
whom
had
been
entrusted
the
more
realized
the
absence
all
personal
motive
that
old
man
whom
there
seemed
remain
only
the
habit
passions
and
place
intellect
grouping
events
and
drawing
conclusions
only
the
capacity
calmly
contemplate
the
course
events
the
more
reassured
was
that
everything
would
should
will
not
bring
any
plan
his
own
will
not
devise
undertake
anything
thought
prince
andrew
but
will
hear
everything
remember
everything
and
put
everything
its
place
will
not
hinder
anything
useful
nor
allow
anything
harmful
understands
that
there
something
stronger
and
more
important
than
his
own
will
the
inevitable
course
events
and
can
see
them
and
grasp
their
significance
and
seeing
that
significance
can
refrain
from
meddling
and
renounce
his
personal
wish
directed
something
else
and
above
all
thought
prince
andrew
one
believes
him
because
russian
despite
the
novel
genlis
and
the
french
proverbs
and
because
his
voice
shook
when
said
what
they
have
brought
and
had
sob
when
said
would
make
them
eat
horseflesh
such
feelings
more
less
dimly
shared
all
the
unanimity
and
general
approval
were
founded
with
which
despite
court
influences
the
popular
choice
kutuzov
commander
chief
was
received
chapter
xvii
after
the
emperor
had
left
moscow
life
flowed
there
its
usual
course
and
its
course
was
very
usual
that
was
difficult
remember
the
recent
days
patriotic
elation
and
ardor
hard
believe
that
russia
was
really
danger
and
that
the
members
the
english
club
were
also
sons
the
fatherland
ready
sacrifice
everything
for
the
one
thing
that
recalled
the
patriotic
fervor
everyone
had
displayed
during
the
emperor
stay
was
the
call
for
contributions
men
and
money
necessity
that
soon
the
promises
had
been
made
assumed
legal
official
form
and
became
unavoidable
with
the
enemy
approach
moscow
the
moscovites
view
their
situation
did
not
grow
more
serious
but
the
contrary
became
even
more
frivolous
always
happens
with
people
who
see
great
danger
approaching
the
approach
danger
there
are
always
two
voices
that
speak
with
equal
power
the
human
soul
one
very
reasonably
tells
man
consider
the
nature
the
danger
and
the
means
escaping
the
other
still
more
reasonably
says
that
too
depressing
and
painful
think
the
danger
since
not
man
power
foresee
everything
and
avert
the
general
course
events
and
therefore
better
disregard
what
painful
till
comes
and
think
about
what
pleasant
solitude
man
generally
listens
the
first
voice
but
society
the
second
was
now
with
the
inhabitants
moscow
was
long
since
people
had
been
gay
moscow
that
year
rostopchin
broadsheets
headed
woodcuts
drink
shop
potman
and
moscow
burgher
called
karpushka
chigirin
who
having
been
militiaman
and
having
had
rather
too
much
the
pub
heard
that
napoleon
wished
come
moscow
grew
angry
abused
the
french
very
bad
language
came
out
the
drink
shop
and
under
the
sign
the
eagle
began
address
the
assembled
people
were
read
and
discussed
together
with
the
latest
vasili
lvovich
pushkin
bouts
rimes
the
corner
room
the
club
members
gathered
read
these
broadsheets
and
some
liked
the
way
karpushka
jeered
the
french
saying
they
will
swell
with
russian
cabbage
burst
with
our
buckwheat
porridge
and
choke
themselves
with
cabbage
soup
they
are
all
dwarfs
and
one
peasant
woman
will
toss
three
them
with
hayfork
others
did
not
like
that
tone
and
said
was
stupid
and
vulgar
was
said
that
rostopchin
had
expelled
all
frenchmen
and
even
all
foreigners
from
moscow
and
that
there
had
been
some
spies
and
agents
napoleon
among
them
but
this
was
told
chiefly
introduce
rostopchin
witty
remark
that
occasion
the
foreigners
were
deported
nizhni
boat
and
rostopchin
had
said
them
french
rentrez
vousmemes
entrez
dans
barque
faites
pas
une
barque
charon
there
was
talk
all
the
government
offices
having
been
already
removed
from
moscow
and
this
shinshin
witticism
was
added
that
for
that
alone
moscow
ought
grateful
napoleon
was
said
that
mamonov
regiment
would
cost
him
eight
hundred
thousand
rubles
and
that
bezukhov
had
spent
even
more
his
but
that
the
best
thing
about
bezukhov
action
was
that
himself
was
going
don
uniform
and
ride
the
head
his
regiment
without
charging
anything
for
the
show
think
over
get
into
the
barque
and
take
care
not
make

directing
sly
sarcastic

toward

good
nature
pierre
personality
immediately
checked
any
attempt

him
his

she
petit

jeune

little
bit
love
with
the
young
man
forfeit
forfeit
forfeit
but
how
could
one
say
that
russian
chapter
xviii
when
pierre
returned
home
was
handed
two
rostopchin
broadsheets
that
had
been
brought
that
day
the
first
declared
that
the
report
that
count
rostopchin
had
forbidden
people
leave
moscow
was
false
the
contrary
was
glad
that
ladies
and
tradesmen
wives
were
leaving
the
city
there
will
less
panic
and
less
gossip
ran
the
broadsheet
but
will
stake
life
that
scoundrel
will
not
enter
moscow
these
words
showed
pierre
clearly
for
the
first
time
that
the
french
would
enter
moscow
the
second
broadsheet
stated
that
our
headquarters
were
vyazma
that
count
wittgenstein
had
defeated
the
french
but
that
many
the
inhabitants
moscow
wished
armed
weapons
were
ready
for
them
the
arsenal
sabers
pistols
and
muskets
which
could
had
low
price
the
tone
the
proclamation
was
not
jocose
the
former
chigirin
talks
pierre
pondered
over
these
broadsheets
evidently
the
terrible
stormcloud
had
desired
with
the
whole
strength
his
soul
but
which
yet
aroused
involuntary
horror
him
was
drawing
near
shall
join
the
army
and
enter
the
service
wait
asked
himself
for
the
hundredth
time
took
pack
cards
that
lay
the
table
and
began
lay
them
out
for
game
patience
this
patience
comes
out
said
himself
after
shuffling
the
cards
holding
them
his
hand
and
lifting
his
head
comes
out
means
what
does
mean
had
not
decided
what
should
mean
when
heard
the
voice
the
eldest
princess
the
door
asking
whether
she
might
come
then
will
mean
that
must
the
army
said
pierre
himself
come
come
added
the
princess
only
the
eldest
princess
the
one
with
the
stony
face
and
long
waist
was
still
living
pierre
house
the
two
younger
ones
had
both
married
excuse
coming
you
cousin
she
said
reproachful
and
agitated
voice
you
know
some
decision
must
come
what
going
happen
everyone
has
left
moscow
and
the
people

barbara

the

with

she
sat

barbara

told

killed
her
because

but
you
take
everything

said
pierre
and
began
laying
out
his
cards
for
patience
although
that
patience
did
come
out
pierre
did
not
join
the
army
but
remained
deserted
moscow
ever
the
same
state
agitation
irresolution
and
alarm
yet
the
same
time
joyfully
expecting
something
terrible
next
day
toward
evening
the

set
off
and
pierre

came
inform

general
the

made
out
pierre
that
his

pierre
listened
him
scarcely
able
repress
smile
well
then
sell
said
what
done
can
draw
back
now
the
worse
everything
became
especially
his
own
affairs
the
better
was
pierre
pleased
and
the
more
evident
was
that
the
catastrophe
expected
was
approaching
hardly
anyone

round
the

stopped
and
got
out

french

accused

the

piteously
another

near
judging
their

they
were

pierre
pushed
his

through
the

what

kept
asking

the

the

answered
him
the
stout

rose
frowned
shrugged
his

and
evidently
trying
appear
firm
began
pull
his
jacket
without
looking
about
him
but
suddenly
his
lips
trembled
and
began
cry
the
way
full

cry

angry
with

for

the

the

choked

turned

took

this

murmured
himself
the
sight
the
tortured
frenchman
and
the
crowd
surrounding
the

pierre
had
definitely
made
his
mind
that
could
longer
remain
moscow
and
would
leave
for
the

that
very

that
seemed
him
that
either
had
told

this
that

pierre
gave
orders
evstafey
his

knew
everything

and
after

left

changing

that
night

that
there
had
been

nobody

next

was
approaching
mozhaysk
every

pierre
pushed
forward

the
farther
left
moscow
behind
and
the
deeper
plunged
into
that
sea
troops
the
more
was
overcome
restless
agitation
and
new
and
joyful
feeling
had
not
experienced
before
was
feeling
akin
what
had
felt
the
sloboda
palace
during
the
emperor
visit
sense
the
necessity
undertaking
something
and
sacrificing
something
now
experienced
glad
consciousness
that
everything
that
constitutes

happiness

rubbish
pleasant

with

with
what
pierre
could
not

and
did
not
try
determine
for

and
for
what
felt
such
particular
delight
sacrificing
everything
was
not

with

chapter
xix
the
twenty
fourth
august
the
battle
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
fought
the
twenty
fifth
not
shot
was
fired
either
side
and
the
twenty
sixth
the
battle
borodino
itself
took
place
why
and
how
were
the
battles
shevardino
and
borodino
given
and
accepted
why
was
the
battle
borodino
fought
there
was
not
the
least
sense
for
either
the
french
the
russians
its
immediate
result
for
the
russians
was
and
was
bound
that
were
brought
nearer
the
destruction
moscow
which
feared
more
than
anything
the
world
and
for
the
french
its
immediate
result
was
that
they
were
brought
nearer
the
destruction
their
whole
army
which
they
feared
more
than
anything
the
world
what
the
result
must
was
quite
obvious
and
yet
napoleon
offered
and
kutuzov
accepted
that
battle
the
commanders
had
been
guided
reason
would
seem
that
must
have
been
obvious
napoleon
that
advancing
thirteen
hundred
miles
and
giving
battle
with
probability
losing
quarter
his
army
was
advancing
certain
destruction
and
must
have
been
equally
clear
kutuzov
that
accepting
battle
and
risking
the
loss
quarter
his
army
would
certainly
lose
moscow
for
kutuzov
this
was
mathematically
clear
that
when
playing
draughts
have
one
man
less
and
exchanging
shall
certainly
lose
and
therefore
should
not
exchange
when
opponent
has
sixteen
men
and
have
fourteen
only
one
eighth
weaker
than
but
when
have
exchanged
thirteen
more
men
will
three
times
strong
before
the
battle
borodino
our
strength
proportion
the
french
was
about
five
six
but
after
that
battle
was
little
more
than
one
two
previously
had
hundred
thousand
against
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
afterwards
little
more
than
fifty
thousand
against
hundred
thousand
yet
the
shrewd
and
experienced
kutuzov
accepted
the
battle
while
napoleon
who
was
said
commander
genius
gave
losing
quarter
his
army
and
lengthening
his
lines
communication
still
more
said
that
expected
end
the
campaign
occupying
moscow
had
ended
previous
campaign
occupying
vienna
there
much
evidence
the
contrary
napoleon
historians
themselves
tell
that
from
smolensk
onwards
wished
stop
knew
the
danger
his
extended
position
and
knew
that
the
occupation
moscow
would
not
the
end
the
campaign
for
had
seen
smolensk
the
state
which
russian
towns
were
left
him
and
had
not
received
single
reply
his
repeated
announcements
his
wish
negotiate
giving
and
accepting
battle
borodino
kutuzov
acted
involuntarily
and
irrationally
but
later
fit
what
had
occurred
the
historians
provided
cunningly
devised
evidence
the
foresight
and
genius
the
generals
who
all
the
blind
tools
history
were
the
most
enslaved
and
involuntary
the
ancients
have
left
model
heroic
poems
which
the
heroes
furnish
the
whole
interest
the
story
and
are
still
unable
accustom
ourselves
the
fact
that
for
our
epoch
histories
that
kind
are
meaningless
the
other
question
how
the
battle
borodino
and
the
preceding
battle
shevardino
were
fought
there
also
exists
definite
and
well
known
but
quite
false
conception
all
the
historians
describe
the
affair
follows
the
russian
army
they
say
its
retreat
from
smolensk
sought
out
for
itself
the
best
position
for
general
engagement
and
found
such
position
borodino
the
russians
they
say
fortified
this
position
advance
the
left
the
highroad
from
moscow
smolensk
and
almost
right
angle
from
borodino
utitsa
the
very
place
where
the
battle
was
fought
front
this
position
they
say
fortified
outpost
was
set
the
shevardino
mound
observe
the
enemy
the
twenty
fourth
are
told
napoleon
attacked
this
advanced
post
and
took
and
the
twenty
sixth
attacked
the
whole
russian
army
which
was
position
the
field
borodino
the
histories
say
and
all
quite
wrong
anyone
who
cares
look
into
the
matter
can
easily
convince
himself
the
russians
did
not
seek
out
the
best
position
but
the
contrary
during
the
retreat
passed
many
positions
better
than
borodino
they
did
not
stop
any
one
these
positions
because
kutuzov
did
not
wish
occupy
position
had
not
himself
chosen
because
the
popular
demand
for
battle
had
not
yet
expressed
itself
strongly
enough
and
because
miloradovich
had
not
yet
arrived
with
the
militia
and
for
many
other
reasons
the
fact
that
other
positions
they
had
passed
were
stronger
and
that
the
position
borodino
the
one
where
the
battle
was
fought
far
from
being
strong
was
more
position
than
any
other
spot
one
might
find
the
russian
empire
sticking
pin
into
the
map
hazard
not
only
did
the
russians
not
fortify
the
position
the
field
borodino
the
left
and
right
angle
the
highroad
that
the
position
which
the
battle
took
place
but
never
till
the
twenty
fifth
august
did
they
think
that
battle
might
fought
there
this
was
shown
first
the
fact
that
there
were
entrenchments
there
the
twenty
fifth
and
that
those
begun
the
twenty
fifth
and
twenty
sixth
were
not
completed
and
secondly
the
position
the
shevardino
redoubt
that
redoubt
was
quite
senseless
front
the
position
where
the
battle
was
accepted
why
was
more
strongly
fortified
than
any
other
post
and
why
were
all
efforts
exhausted
and
six
thousand
men
sacrificed
defend
till
late
night
the
twenty
fourth
cossack
patrol
would
have
sufficed
observe
the
enemy
thirdly
proof
that
the
position
which
the
battle
was
fought
had
not
been
foreseen
and
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
not
advanced
post
that
position
have
the
fact
that
the
twenty
fifth
barclay
tolly
and
bagration
were
convinced
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
the
left
flank
the
position
and
that
kutuzov
himself
his
report
written
hot
haste
after
the
battle
speaks
the
shevardino
redoubt
the
left
flank
the
position
was
much
later
when
reports
the
battle
borodino
were
written
leisure
that
the
incorrect
and
extraordinary
statement
was
invented
probably
justify
the
mistakes
commander
chief
who
had
represented
infallible
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
advanced
post
whereas
reality
was
simply
fortified
point
the
left
flank
and
that
the
battle
borodino
was
fought
entrenched
position
previously
selected
where
was
fought
quite
unexpected
spot
which
was
almost
unentrenched
the
case
was
evidently
this
position
was
selected
along
the
river
kolocha
which
crosses
the
highroad
not
right
angle
but
acute
angle
that
the
left
flank
was
shevardino
the
right
flank
near
the
village
novoe
and
the
center
borodino
the
confluence
the
rivers
kolocha
and
voyna
anyone
who
looks
the
field
borodino
without
thinking
how
the
battle
was
actually
fought
this
position
protected
the
river
kolocha
presents
itself
obvious
for
army
whose
object
was
prevent
enemy
from
advancing
along
the
smolensk
road
moscow
napoleon
riding
valuevo
the
twenty
fourth
did
not
see
the
history
books
say
did
the
position
the
russians
from
utitsa
borodino
could
not
have
seen
that
position
because
did
not
exist
nor
did
see
advanced
post
the
russian
army
but
while
pursuing
the
russian
rearguard
came
upon
the
left
flank
the
russian
position
the
shevardino
redoubt
and
unexpectedly
for
the
russians
moved
his
army
across
the
kolocha
and
the
russians
not
having
time
begin
general
engagement
withdrew
their
left
wing
from
the
position
they
had
intended
occupy
and
took
new
position
which
had
not
been
foreseen
and
was
not
fortified
crossing
the
other
side
the
kolocha
the
left
the
highroad
napoleon
shifted
the
whole
forthcoming
battle
from
right
left
looking
from
the
russian
side
and
transferred
the
plain
between
utitsa
semenovsk
and
borodino
plain
more
advantageous
position
than
any
other
plain
russia
and
there
the
whole
battle
the
twenty
sixth
august
took
place
had
napoleon
not
ridden
out
the
evening
the
twenty
fourth
the
kolocha
and
had
not
then
ordered
immediate
attack
the
redoubt
but
had
begun
the
attack
next
morning
one
would
have
doubted
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
the
left
flank
our
position
and
the
battle
would
have
taken
place
where
expected
that
case
should
probably
have
defended
the
shevardino
redoubt
our
left
flank
still
more
obstinately
should
have
attacked
napoleon
the
center
the
right
and
the
engagement
would
have
taken
place
the
twenty
fifth
the
position
intended
and
had
fortified
but
the
attack
our
left
flank
took
place
the
evening
after
the
retreat
our
rear
guard
that
immediately
after
the
fight
gridneva
and
the
russian
commanders
did
not
wish
were
not
time
begin
general
engagement
then
the
evening
the
twenty
fourth
the
first
and
chief
action
the
battle
borodino
was
already
lost
the
twenty
fourth
and
obviously
led
the
loss
the
one
fought
the
twenty
sixth
after
the
loss
the
shevardino
redoubt
found
ourselves
the
morning
the
twenty
fifth
without
position
for
our
left
flank
and
were
forced
bend
back
and
hastily
entrench
where
chanced
not
only
was
the
russian
army
the
twenty
sixth
defended
weak
unfinished
entrenchments
but
the
disadvantage
that
position
was
increased
the
fact
that
the
russian
commanders
not
having
fully
realized
what
had
happened
namely
the
loss
our
position
the
left
flank
and
the
shifting
the
whole
field
the
forthcoming
battle
from
right
left
maintained
their
extended
position
from
the
village
novoe
utitsa
and
consequently
had
move
their
forces
from
right
left
during
the
battle
happened
that
throughout
the
whole
battle
the
russians
opposed
the
entire
french
army

the

the
twenty
fifth

was
leaving
mozhaysk
the
descent
the
high
steep
hill
down
which
winding
road
led
out

and
the

the
day
before
the
peasant

shouting
and
lashing
their

kept
crossing
from
side
side
the
carts
each
which
three
four
wounded
soldiers
were
lying
sitting
jolted
over
the
stones
that
had
been
thrown
the
steep
incline
make
something
like
road
the
wounded
bandaged
with
rags
with
pale
cheeks
compressed
lips
and
knitted
brows
held
the
sides
the
carts
they
were
jolted
against

almost
all

childlike
curiosity

shouted
angrily
the
convoy

keep
one
side
the
road
the
cavalry
regiment
descended
the
hill
with
its
singers
surrounded
pierre
carriage
and
blocked
the
road
pierre
stopped
being
pressed
against
the
side
the
cutting
which
the
road
ran
the
sunshine
from
behind
the
hill
did
not
penetrate
into
the
cutting
and
there
was
cold
and
damp
but
above
pierre
head
was
the
bright
august
sunshine
and
the
bells
sounded
merrily
one
the
carts
with
wounded
stopped
the
side
the
road
close
pierre
the
driver
his
bast
shoes
ran
panting
placed
stone
under
one
its
tireless
hind
wheels
and
began
arranging
the
breech
band
his
little
horse
one
the
wounded
old
soldier
with
bandaged
arm
who
was
following
the
cart
foot
caught
hold
with
his
sound
hand
and
turned
look
pierre
say
fellow
countryman
will
they
set
down
here
take
moscow
asked
pierre
was
deep
thought
that
did
not
hear
the
question
was
looking
now
the
cavalry
regiment
that
had
met
the
convoy
wounded
now
the
cart
which
was
standing
which
two
wounded
men
were
sitting
and
one
was
lying
one
those
sitting
the
cart
had
probably
been
wounded
the
cheek
his
whole
head
was
wrapped
rags
and
one
cheek
was
swollen
the
size
baby
head
his
nose
and
mouth
were
twisted
one
side
this
soldier
was
looking
the
cathedral
and
crossing
himself
another
young
lad
fair
haired
recruit
white
though
there
was
blood
his
thin
face
looked
pierre
kindly
with
fixed
smile
the
third
lay
prone
that
his
face
was
not
visible
the
cavalry
singers
were
passing
close
lost
quite
lost
head
keen
living
foreign
land
they
sang
their
soldiers
dance
song
responding
them
but
with
different
sort
merriment
the
metallic
sound
the
bells
reverberated
high
above
and
the
hot
rays
the
sun
bathed
the
top
the
opposite
slope
with
yet
another
sort
merriment
but
beneath
the
slope
the
cart
with
the
wounded
near
the
panting
little
nag
where
pierre
stood
was
damp
somber
and
sad
the
soldier
with
the
swollen
cheek
looked
angrily
the
cavalry
singers
the
coxcombs
muttered
reproachfully
not
the
soldiers
only
but
seen
peasants
today
too
the
peasants
even
they
have
said
the
soldier
behind
the
cart
addressing
pierre
with
sad
smile
distinctions
made
nowadays
they
want
the
whole
nation
fall
them
word
moscow
they
want
make
end
spite
the
obscurity
the
soldier
words
pierre
understood
what
wanted
say
and
nodded
approval
the
road
was
clear
again
pierre
descended
the
hill
and
drove
kept
looking
either
side
the
road
for
familiar
faces
but
only
saw
everywhere
the
unfamiliar
faces
various
military
men
different
branches
the
service
who
all
looked
with
astonishment
his
white
hat
and
green
tail
coat
having
gone
nearly
three
miles
last
met
acquaintance
and
eagerly
addressed
him
this
was
one
the
head
army
doctors
was
driving
toward
pierre
covered
gig
sitting
beside
young
surgeon
and
recognizing
pierre
told
the
cossack
who
occupied
the
driver
seat
pull
count
your
excellency
how
come
you
here
asked
the
doctor
well
you
know
wanted
see
yes
yes
there
will
something
see
pierre
got
out
and
talked
the
doctor
explaining
his
intention
taking
part
battle
the
doctor
advised
him
apply
direct
kutuzov
why
should
you
god
knows
where
out
sight
during
the
battle
said
exchanging
glances
with
his
young
companion
anyhow
his
serene
highness
knows
you
and
will
receive
you
graciously
that
what
you
must
the
doctor
seemed
tired
and
hurry
you
think
also
wanted
ask
you
where
our
position
exactly
said
pierre
the
position
repeated
the
doctor
well
that
not
line
drive
past
tatarinova
lot
digging
going
there
the
hillock
and
you
see
can
one
see
from
there
you
would
but
the
doctor
interrupted
him
and
moved
toward
his
gig
would
with
you
but
honor
here
and
pointed
his
throat
galloping
the
commander
the
corps
how
matters
stand
you
know
count
there
battle
tomorrow
out
army
hundred
thousand
must
expect
least
twenty
thousand
wounded
and
haven
stretchers
bunks
dressers
doctors
enough
for
six
thousand
have
ten
thousand
carts
but
need
other
things
well
must
manage
best
can
the
strange
thought
that
the
thousands
men
young
and
old
who
had
stared
with
merry
surprise
his
hat
perhaps
the
very
men
had
noticed
twenty
thousand
were
inevitably
doomed
wounds
and
death
amazed
pierre
they
may
die
tomorrow
why
are
they
thinking
anything
but
death
and
some
latent
sequence
thought
the
descent
the
mozhaysk
hill
the
carts
with
the
wounded
the
ringing
bells
the
slanting
rays
the
sun
and
the
songs
the
cavalrymen
vividly
recurred
his
mind
the
cavalry
ride
battle
and
meet
the
wounded
and
not
for
moment
think
what
awaits
them
but
pass
winking
the
wounded
yet
from
among
these
men
twenty
thousand
are
doomed
die
and
they
wonder
hat
strange
thought
pierre
continuing
his
way
tatarinova
front
landowner
house
the
left
the
road
stood
carriages
wagons
and
crowds
orderlies
and
sentinels
the
commander
chief
was
putting
there
but
just
when
pierre
arrived
was
not
and
hardly
any
the
staff
were
there
they
had
gone
the
church
service
pierre
drove
toward
gorki
when
had
ascended
the
hill
and
reached
the
little
village
street
saw
for
the
first
time
peasant
militiamen
their
white
shirts
and
with
crosses
their
caps
who
talking
and
laughing
loudly
animated
and
perspiring
were
work
huge
knoll
overgrown
with
grass
the
right
the
road
some
them
were
digging
others
were
wheeling
barrowloads
earth
along
planks
while
others
stood
about
doing
nothing
two
officers
were
standing
the
knoll
directing
the
men
seeing
these
peasants
who
were
evidently
still
amused
the
novelty
their
position
soldiers
pierre
once
more
thought
the
wounded
men
mozhaysk
and
understood
what
the
soldier
had
meant
when
said
they
want
the
whole
nation
fall
them
the
sight
these
bearded
peasants
work
the
battlefield
with
their
queer
clumsy
boots
and
perspiring
necks
and
their
shirts
opening
from
the
left
toward
the
middle
unfastened
exposing
their
sunburned
collarbones
impressed
pierre
more
strongly
with
the
solemnity
and
importance
the
moment
than
anything
had
yet
seen
heard
chapter
xxi
pierre
stepped
out
his
carriage
and
passing
the
toiling
militiamen
ascended
the
knoll
from
which
according
the
doctor
the
battlefield
could
seen
was
about
eleven
clock
the
sun
shone
somewhat
the
left
and
behind
him
and
brightly
lit
the
enormous
panorama
which
rising
like
amphitheater
extended
before
him
the
clear
rarefied
atmosphere
from
above
the
left
bisecting
that
amphitheater
wound
the
smolensk
highroad
passing
through
village
with
white
church
some
five
hundred
paces
front
the
knoll
and
below
this
was
borodino
below
the
village
the
road
crossed
the
river
bridge
and
winding
down
and
rose
higher
and
higher
the
village
valuevo
visible
about
four
miles
away
where
napoleon
was
then
stationed
beyond
valuevo
the
road
disappeared
into
yellowing

and
there
over
the

and
the

indefinite
masses

the

the
ground
the
right
along
the
course
the

moskva
rivers
was
broken
and
hilly
between
the
hollows
the
villages
bezubova
and
zakharino
showed
the
distance
the
left
the
ground
was
more
level
there
were
fields
grain
and
the
smoking
ruins
semenovsk
which
had
been
burned
down
could
seen
all
that
pierre
saw
was
indefinite
that
neither
the
left
nor
the
right
side
the
field
fully
satisfied
his
expectations
nowhere
could
see
the
battlefield
had
expected
find
but
only
fields

mounds
and

and

could
descry
military
position
this
place
which
teemed
with
life
nor
could
even
distinguish
our
troops
from
the
enemy
must
ask
someone
who
knows
thought
and
addressed
officer
who
was
looking
with
curiosity
his
huge
unmilitary
figure
may
ask
you
said
pierre
what
village
that
front
burdino
isn
said
the
officer
turning
his
companion
borodino
the
other
corrected
him
the
officer
evidently
glad
opportunity
for
talk
moved
pierre
are
those
our
men
there
pierre
inquired
yes
and
there
further
are
the
french
said
the
officer
there
they
are
there
you
can
see
them
where
where
asked
pierre
one
can
see
them
with
the
naked
eye
why
there
the
officer
pointed
with
his
hand
the
smoke
visible
the
left
beyond
the
river
and
the
same
stern
and
serious
expression
that
pierre
had
noticed
many
the
faces
had
met
came
into
his
face
those
are
the
french
and
over
there
pierre
pointed
knoll
the
left
near
which
some
troops
could
seen
those
are
ours
ours
and
there
pierre
pointed
another
knoll
the
distance
with
big
tree
near
village
that
lay
hollow
where
also
some
campfires
were
smoking
and
something
black
was
visible
that
his
again
said
the
officer
was
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
ours
yesterday
but
now
his
then
how
about
our
position
our
position
replied
the
officer
with
smile
satisfaction
can
tell
you
quite
clearly
because
constructed
nearly
all
our
entrenchments
there
you
see
there
our
center
borodino
just
there
and
pointed
the
village
front
them
with
the
white
church
that
where
one
crosses
the
kolocha
you
see
down
there
where
the
rows
hay
are
lying
the
hollow
there
the
bridge
that
our
center
our
right
flank
over
there
pointed
sharply
the
right
far
away
the
broken
ground
that
where
the
moskva
river
and
have
thrown
three
redoubts
there
very
strong
ones
the
left
flank
here
the
officer
paused
well
you
see
that
difficult
explain
yesterday
our
left
flank
was
there
shevardino
you
see
where
the
oak
but
now
have
withdrawn
our
left
wing
now
over
there
you
see
that
village
and
the
smoke
that
semenovsk
yes
there
pointed
raevski
knoll
but
the
battle
will
hardly
there
his
having
moved
his
troops
there
only
ruse
will
probably
pass
round
the
right
the
moskva
but
wherever
may
many
man
will
missing
tomorrow
remarked
elderly
sergeant
who
had
approached
the
officer
while
was
giving
these
explanations
had
waited
silence
for
him
finish
speaking
but
this
point
evidently
not
liking
the
officer
remark
interrupted
him
gabions
must
sent
for
said
sternly
the
officer
appeared
abashed
though
understood
that
one
might
think
how
many
men
would
missing
tomorrow
but
ought
not
speak
well
send
number
three
company
again
the
officer
replied
hurriedly
and
you
are
you
one
the
doctors
come
own
answered
pierre
and
went
down
the
hill
again
passing
the
militiamen
those
damned
fellows
muttered
the
officer
who
followed
him
holding
his
nose
ran
past
the
men
work
there
they
are
bringing
her
coming
there
they
are
they
here
minute
voices
were
suddenly
heard
saying
and
officers
soldiers
and
militiamen
began
running
forward
along
the
road
church
procession
was
coming
the
hill
from
borodino
first
along
the
dusty
road
came
the
infantry
ranks
bareheaded
and
with
arms
reversed
from
behind
them
came
the
sound
church
singing
soldiers
and
militiamen
ran
bareheaded
past
pierre
toward
the
procession
they
are
bringing
her
our
protectress
the
iberian

someone
cried
the
smolensk
mother

another
corrected
him
the
militiamen
both
those
who
had
been
the
village
and
those
who
had
been
work
the
battery
threw
down
their
spades
and
ran
meet
the
church
procession
following
the
battalion
that
marched
along
the
dusty
road
came
priests
their
vestments
one
little
old
man
hood
with
attendants
and
singers
behind
them
soldiers
and
officers
bore
large
dark
faced
icon
with
embossed
metal
cover
this
was
the
icon
that
had
been
brought
from
smolensk
and
had
since
accompanied
the
army
behind
before
and
both
sides
crowds
militiamen
with
bared
heads
walked
ran
and
bowed
the
ground
the
summit
the
hill
they
stopped
with
the
icon
the
men
who
had
been
holding
the
linen
bands
attached
were
relieved
others
the
chanters
relit
their
censers
and
service
began
the
hot
rays
the
sun
beat
down
vertically
and
fresh
soft
wind
played
with
the
hair
the
bared
heads
and
with
the
ribbons
decorating
the
icon
the
singing
did
not
sound
loud
under
the
open
sky
immense
crowd
bareheaded
officers
soldiers
and
militiamen
surrounded
the
icon
behind
the
priest
and
chanter
stood
the
notabilities
spot
reserved
for
them
bald
general
with
george
cross
his
neck
stood
just
behind
the
priest
back
and
without
crossing
himself
was
evidently
german
patiently
awaited
the
end
the
service
which
considered
necessary
hear
the
end
probably
arouse
the
patriotism
the
russian
people
another
general
stood
martial
pose
crossing
himself
shaking
his
hand
front
his
chest
while
looking
about
him
standing
among
the
crowd
peasants
pierre
recognized
several
acquaintances
among
these
notables
but
did
not
look
them
his
whole
attention
was
absorbed
watching
the
serious
expression
the
faces
the
crowd
soldiers
and
militiamen
who
were
all
gazing
eagerly
the
icon
soon
the
tired
chanters
who
were
singing
the
service
for
the
twentieth
time
that
day
began
lazily
and
mechanically
sing
save
from
calamity
thy
servants
mother
god
and
the
priest
and
deacon
chimed
for
thee
under
god
all
flee
inviolable
bulwark
and
protection
there
again
kindled
all
those
faces
the
same
expression
consciousness
the
solemnity
the
impending
moment
that
pierre
had
seen
the
faces
the
foot
the
hill
mozhaysk
and
momentarily
many
and
many
faces
had
met
that
morning
and
heads
were
bowed
more
frequently
and
hair
tossed
back
and
sighs
and
the
sound
men
made
they
crossed
themselves
were
heard
the
crowd
round
the
icon
suddenly
parted
and
pressed
against
pierre
someone
very
important
personage
judging
the
haste
with
which
way
was
made
for
him
was
approaching
the
icon
was
kutuzov
who
had
been
riding
round
the
position
and
his
way
back
tatarinova
had
stopped
where
the
service
was
being
held
pierre
recognized
him
once
his
peculiar
figure
which
distinguished
him
from
everybody
else
with
long
overcoat
his
exceedingly
stout
round
shouldered
body
with
uncovered
white
head
and
puffy
face
showing
the
white
ball
the
eye
had
lost
kutuzov
walked
with
plunging
swaying
gait
into
the
crowd
and
stopped
behind
the
priest
crossed
himself
with
accustomed
movement
bent
till
touched
the
ground
with
his
hand
and
bowed
his
white
head
with
deep
sigh
behind
kutuzov
was
bennigsen
and
the
suite
despite
the
presence
the
commander
chief
who
attracted
the
attention
all
the
superior
officers
the
militiamen
and
soldiers
continued
their
prayers
without
looking
him
when
the
service
was
over
kutuzov
stepped
the
icon
sank
heavily
his
knees
bowed
the
ground
and
for
long
time
tried
vainly
rise
but
could
not
account
his
weakness
and
weight
his
white
head
twitched
with
the
effort
last
rose
kissed
the
icon
child
does
with
naively
pouting
lips
and
again
bowed
till
touched
the
ground
with
his
hand
the
other
generals
followed
his
example
then
the
officers
and
after
them
with
excited
faces
pressing
one
another
crowding
panting
and
pushing
scrambled
the
soldiers
and
militiamen
chapter

staggering
amid
the
crush
pierre
looked
about
him
count
peter
kirilovich
how
did
you
get
here
said
voice
pierre
looked
round
boris
drubetskoy
brushing
his
knees
with
his
hand
had
probably
soiled
them
when
too
had
knelt
before
the
icon
came
him
smiling
boris
was
elegantly
dressed
with
slightly
martial
touch
appropriate
campaign
wore
long
coat
and
like
kutuzov
had
whip
slung
across
his
shoulder
meanwhile
kutuzov
had
reached
the
village
and
seated
himself
the
shade
the
nearest
house
bench
which
one
cossack
had
run
fetch
and
another
had
hastily
covered
with
rug
immense
and
brilliant
suite
surrounded
him
the
icon
was
carried
further
accompanied
the
throng
pierre
stopped
some
thirty
paces
from
kutuzov
talking
boris
explained
his
wish
present
the
battle
and
see
the
position
this
what
you
must
said
boris
will
the
honors
the
camp
you
you
will
see
everything
best
from
where
count
bennigsen
will
attendance
him
you
know
mention
him
but
you
want
ride
round
the
position
come
along
with
are
just
going
the
left
flank
then
when
get
back
spend
the
night
with
and
arrange
game
cards
course
you
know
dmitri
sergeevich
those
are
his
quarters
and
pointed
the
third
house
the
village
gorki
but
should
like
see
the
right
flank
they
say
very
strong
said
pierre
should
like
start
from
the
moskva
river
and
ride
round
the
whole
position
well
you
can
that
later
but
the
chief
thing
the
left
flank
yes
yes
but
where
prince
bolkonski
regiment
can
you
point
out
prince
andrew
shall
pass
and
take
you
him
what
about
the
left
flank
asked
pierre
tell
you
the
truth
between
ourselves
god
only
knows
what
state
our
left
flank
said
boris
confidentially
lowering
his
voice
not
all
what
count
bennigsen
intended
meant
fortify
that
knoll
quite
differently
but
boris
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
serene
highness
would
not
have
someone
persuaded
him
you
see
but
boris
did
not
finish
for
that
moment
kaysarov
kutuzov
adjutant
came
pierre
kaysarov
said
boris
addressing
him
with
unembarrassed
smile
was
just
trying
explain
our
position
the
count
amazing
how
his
serene
highness
could
foresee
the
intentions
the
french
you
mean
the
left
flank
asked
kaysarov
yes
exactly
the
left
flank
now
extremely
strong
though
kutuzov
had
dismissed
all
unnecessary
men
from
the
staff
boris
had
contrived
remain
headquarters
after
the
changes
had
established
himself
with
count
bennigsen
who
like
all
whom
boris
had
been
attendance
considered
young
prince
drubetskoy
invaluable
man
the
higher
command
there
were
two
sharply
defined
parties
kutuzov
party
and
that
bennigsen
the
chief
staff
boris
belonged
the
latter
and
one
else
while
showing
servile
respect
kutuzov
could
create
impression
that
the
old
fellow
was
not
much
good
and
that
bennigsen
managed
everything
now
the
decisive
moment
battle
had
come
when
kutuzov
would
destroyed
and
the
power
pass
bennigsen
even
kutuzov
won
the
battle
would
felt
that
everything
was
done
bennigsen
any
case
many
great
rewards
would
have
given
for
tomorrow
action
and
new
men
would
come
the
front
boris
was
full
nervous
vivacity
all
day
after
kaysarov
others
whom
pierre
knew
came
him
and
had
not
time
reply
all
the
questions
about
moscow
that
were
showered
upon
him
listen
all
that
was
told
him
the
faces
all
expressed
animation
and
apprehension
but
seemed
pierre
that
the
cause
the
excitement
shown
some
these
faces
lay
chiefly
questions
personal
success
his
mind
however
was
occupied
the
different
expression
saw
other
faces
expression
that
spoke
not
personal
matters
but
the
universal
questions
life
and
death
kutuzov
noticed
pierre
figure
and
the
group
gathered
round
him
call
him
said
kutuzov
adjutant
told
pierre
his
serene
highness
wish
and
pierre
went
toward
kutuzov
bench
but
militiaman
got
there
before
him
was
dolokhov
how
did
that
fellow
get
here
asked
pierre
creature
that
wriggles
anywhere
was
the
answer
has
been
degraded
you
know
now
wants
bob
again
been
proposing
some
scheme
other
and
has
crawled
into
the
enemy
picket
line
night
brave
fellow
pierre
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
respectfully
kutuzov
concluded
that
reported
your
serene
highness
you
might
send
away
say
that
you
knew
what
was
reporting
but
then
shouldn
lose
anything
dolokhov
was
saying
yes
yes
but
were
right
should
rendering
service
fatherland
for
which
ready
die
yes
yes
and
should
your
serene
highness
require
man
who
will
not
spare
his
skin
please
think
perhaps
may
prove
useful
your
serene
highness
yes
yes
kutuzov
repeated
his
laughing
eye
narrowing
more
and
more
looked
pierre
just
then
boris
with
his
courtierlike
adroitness
stepped
pierre
side
near
kutuzov
and
most
natural
manner
without
raising
his
voice
said
pierre
though
continuing
interrupted
conversation
the
militia
have
put
clean
white
shirts
ready
die
what
heroism
count
boris
evidently
said
this
pierre
order
overheard
his
serene
highness
knew
kutuzov
attention
would
caught
those
words
and
was
what
are
you
saying
about
the
militia
asked
boris
preparing
for
tomorrow
your
serene
highness
for
death
they
have
put
clean
shirts
wonderful
matchless
people
said
kutuzov
and
closed
his
eyes
and
swayed
his
head
matchless
people
repeated
with
sigh
you
want
smell
gunpowder
said
pierre
yes
pleasant
smell
have
the
honor
one
your
wife
adorers
she
well
quarters
are
your
service
and
often
happens
with
old
people
kutuzov
began
looking
about
absent
mindedly
forgetting
all
wanted
say
then
evidently
remembering
what
wanted
beckoned
andrew
kaysarov
his
adjutant
brother
those
verses
those
verses
marin
how
they
those
wrote
about
gerakov
lectures
for
the
corps
inditing
recite
them
recite
them
said
evidently
preparing
laugh
kaysarov
recited
kutuzov
smilingly
nodded
his
head
the
rhythm
the
verses
when
pierre
had
left
kutuzov
dolokhov
came
him
and
took
his
hand
very
glad
meet
you
here
count
said
aloud
regardless
the
presence
strangers
and
particularly
resolute
and
solemn
tone
the
eve
day
when
god
alone
knows
who
fated
survive
glad
this
opportunity
tell
you
that
regret
the
misunderstandings
that
occurred
between
and
should
wish
you
not
have
any
ill
feeling
for
beg
you
forgive
pierre
looked
dolokhov
with
smile
not
knowing
what
say
him
with
tears
his
eyes
dolokhov
embraced
pierre
and
kissed
him
boris
said
few
words
his
general
and
count
bennigsen
turned
pierre
and
proposed
that
should
ride
with
him
along
the
line
will
interest
you
said
yes
very
much
replied
pierre
half
hour
later
kutuzov
left
for
tatarinova
and
bennigsen
and
his
suite
with
pierre
among
them
set
out
their
ride
along
the
line
chapter
xxiii
from
gorki
bennigsen
descended
the
highroad
the
bridge
which
when
they
had
looked
from
the
hill
the
officer
had
pointed
out
being
the
center
our
position
and
where
rows
fragrant
new
mown
hay
lay
the
riverside
they
rode
across
that
bridge
into
the
village
borodino
and
thence
turned
the
left
passing
enormous
number
troops
and
guns
and
came
high
knoll
where
militiamen
were
digging
this
was
the
redoubt
yet
unnamed
which
afterwards
became
known
the
raevski
redoubt
the
knoll
battery
but
pierre
paid
special
attention
did
not
know
that
would
become
more
memorable
him
than
any
other
spot
the
plain
borodino
they
then
crossed
the
hollow
semenovsk
where
the
soldiers
were
dragging
away
the
last
logs
from
the
huts
and
barns
then
they
rode
downhill
and
uphill
across
ryefield
trodden
and
beaten
down
hail
following
track
freshly
made
the
artillery
over
the
furrows
the
plowed
land
and
reached
some
fleches
which
were
still
being
dug
kind
entrenchment
the
fleches
bennigsen
stopped
and
began
looking
the
shevardino
redoubt
opposite
which
had
been
ours
the
day
before
and
where
several
horsemen
could
descried
the
officers
said
that
either
napoleon
murat
was
there
and
they
all
gazed
eagerly
this
little
group
horsemen
pierre
also
looked
them
trying
guess
which
the
scarcely
discernible
figures
was
napoleon
last
those
mounted
men
rode
away
from
the
mound
and
disappeared
bennigsen
spoke
general
who
approached
him
and
began
explaining
the
whole
position
our
troops
pierre
listened
him
straining
each
faculty
understand
the
essential
points
the
impending
battle
but
was
mortified
feel
that
his
mental
capacity
was
inadequate
for
the
task
could
make
nothing
bennigsen
stopped
speaking
and
noticing
that
pierre
was
listening
suddenly
said
him
don
think
this
interests
you
the
contrary
very
interesting
replied
pierre
not
quite
truthfully
from
the
fleches
they
rode
still
farther
the
left
along
road
winding
through
thick
low
growing
birch
wood
the
middle
the
wood
brown
hare
with
white
feet
sprang
out
and
scared
the
tramp
the
many
horses
grew
confused
that
leaped
along
the
road
front
them
for
some
time
arousing
general
attention
and
laughter
and
only
when
several
voices
shouted
did
dart
one
side
and
disappear
the
thicket
after
going
through
the
wood
for
about
mile
and
half
they
came
out
glade
where
troops
tuchkov
corps
were
stationed
defend
the
left
flank
here
the
extreme
left
flank
bennigsen
talked
great
deal
and
with
much
heat
and
seemed
pierre
gave
orders
great
military
importance
front
tuchkov
troops
was
some
high
ground
not
occupied
troops
bennigsen
loudly
criticized
this
mistake
saying
that
was
madness
leave
height
which
commanded
the
country
around
unoccupied
and
place
troops
below
some
the
generals
expressed
the
same
opinion
one
particular
declared
with
martial
heat
that
they
were
put
there
slaughtered
bennigsen
his
own
authority
ordered
the
troops
occupy
the
high
ground
this
disposition
the
left
flank
increased
pierre
doubt
his
own
capacity
understand
military
matters
listening
bennigsen
and
the
generals
criticizing
the
position
the
troops
behind
the
hill
quite
understood
them
and
shared
their
opinion
but
for
that
very
reason
could
not
understand
how
the
man
who
put
them
there
behind
the
hill
could
have
made
gross
and
palpable
blunder
pierre
did
not
know
that
these
troops
were
not
bennigsen
supposed
put
there
defend
the
position
but
were
concealed
position
ambush
that
they
should
not
seen
and
might
able
strike
approaching
enemy
unexpectedly
bennigsen
did
not
know
this
and
moved
the
troops
forward
according
his
own
ideas
without
mentioning
the
matter
the
commander
chief
chapter
xxiv
that
bright
evening
august
prince
andrew
lay
leaning
his
elbow
broken
down
shed
the
village
knyazkovo
the
further
end
his
regiment
encampment
through
gap
the
broken
wall
could
see
beside
the
wooden
fence
row
thirty
year
old
birches
with
their
lower
branches
lopped
off
field
which
shocks
oats
were
standing
and
some
bushes
near
which
rose
the
smoke
campfires
the
soldiers
kitchens
narrow
and
burdensome
and
useless
anyone
his
life
now
seemed
him
prince
andrew
the
eve
battle
felt
agitated
and
irritable
had
done
seven
years
before
austerlitz
had
received
and
given
the
orders
for
next
day
battle
and
had
nothing
more
but
his
thoughts
the
simplest
clearest
and
therefore
most
terrible
thoughts
would
give
him
peace
knew
that
tomorrow
battle
would
the
most
terrible
all
had
taken
part
and
for
the
first
time
his
life
the
possibility
death
presented
itself
him
not
relation
any
worldly
matter
with
reference
its
effect
others
but
simply
relation
himself
his
own
soul
vividly
plainly
terribly
and
almost
certainty
and
from
the
height
this
perception
all
that
had
previously
tormented
and
preoccupied
him
suddenly
became
illumined
cold
white
light
without
shadows
without
perspective
without
distinction
outline
all
life
appeared
him
like
magic
lantern
pictures
which
had
long
been
gazing
artificial
light
through
glass
now
suddenly
saw
those
badly
daubed
pictures
clear
daylight
and
without
glass
yes
yes
there
they
are
those
false
images
that
agitated
enraptured
and
tormented
said
himself
passing
review
the
principal
pictures
the
magic
lantern
life
and
regarding
them
now
the
cold
white
daylight
his
clear
perception
death
there
they
are
those
rudely
painted
figures
that
once
seemed
splendid
and
mysterious
glory
the
good
society
love
woman
the
fatherland
itself
how
important
these
pictures
appeared
with
what
profound
meaning
they
seemed
filled
and
all
simple
pale
and
crude
the
cold
white
light
this
morning
which
feel
dawning
for
the
three
great
sorrows
his
life
held
his
attention
particular
his
love
for
woman
his
father
death
and
the
french
invasion
which
had
overrun
half
russia
love
that
little
girl
who
seemed
brimming
over
with
mystic
forces
yes
indeed
loved
her
made
romantic
plans
love
and
happiness
with
her
what
boy
was
said
aloud
bitterly
believed
some
ideal
love
which
was
keep
her
faithful
for
the
whole
year
absence
like
the
gentle
dove
the
fable
she
was
pine
apart
from
but
was
much
simpler
really
was
all
very
simple
and
horrible
when
father
built
bald
hills
thought
the
place
was
his
his
land
his
air
his
peasants
but
napoleon
came
and
swept
him
aside
unconscious
his
existence
might
brush
chip
from
his
path
and
his
bald
hills
and
his
whole
life
fell
pieces

and
the
birches
with
their
light
and
shade
the
curly
clouds
the
smoke
the
campfires
and
all
that
was
around
him
changed
and
seemed
terrible
and
menacing
cold
shiver
ran
down
his
spine
rose
quickly
went
out
the
shed
and
began
walk
about
after
had
returned
voices
were
heard
outside
the
shed
who
that
cried
the

from

shyly
entered

the

prince
andrew
rose
hastily
listened
the
business
they
had
come
about
gave
them
some
further
instructions
and
was
about
dismiss
them
when
heard
familiar
lisping
voice
behind
the
shed
devil
take
said
the
voice
man
stumbling
over
something
prince
andrew
looked
out
the
shed
and
saw
pierre
who
had
tripped
over
pole
the
ground
and
had
nearly
fallen
coming
his
way
was
unpleasant
prince
andrew

reminded
him
all
the
painful
moments
his
last
visit
moscow
you
what
surprise
said
what
brings
you
here
this
unexpected
said
this
his
eyes
and
face
expressed
more
than
coldness
they
expressed
hostility
which
pierre
noticed
once
had
approached
the
shed
full
animation
but
seeing
prince
andrew
face
felt
constrained
and
ill
ease
have
come
simply
you
know
come
interests
said
pierre
who
had
often
that
day
senselessly
repeated
that
word
interesting
wish
see
the
battle
yes
and
what
the
masonic
brothers
say
about
war
how
would
they
stop
said
prince
andrew
sarcastically
well
and
how
moscow

chapter

the
officers
were
about
take
leave
but
prince
andrew
apparently
reluctant
left
alone
with
his
friend
asked
them
stay
and
have
tea
seats
were
brought
and
was
the
tea
the
officers
gazed
with
surprise
pierre
huge
stout
figure
and
listened
his
talk
moscow
and
the
position
our
army
round
which
had
ridden
prince
andrew
remained
silent
and
his
expression
was
forbidding
that
pierre
addressed
his
remarks
chiefly
the
good
natured
battalion
commander
you
understand
the
whole
position
our
troops
prince
andrew
interrupted
him
yes
that
how
you
mean
said
pierre
not
being
military
man
can
say
have
understood
fully
but
understand
the
general
position
well
then
you
know
more
than
anyone
else
who
may
said
prince
andrew
said
pierre
looking
over
his
spectacles
perplexity
prince
andrew
well
and
what
you
think
kutuzov
appointment
asked
was
very
glad
his
appointment
that
all
know
replied
prince
andrew
and
tell
your
opinion
barclay
tolly
moscow
they
are
saying
heaven
knows
what
about
him
what
you
think
him
ask
them
replied
prince
andrew
indicating
the
officers
pierre
looked
timokhin
with
the
condescendingly
interrogative
smile
with
which
everybody
involuntarily
addressed
that
officer
see
light
again
since
his
serenity
has
been
appointed
your
excellency
said
timokhin
timidly
and
continually
turning
glance
his
colonel
why
asked
pierre
well
mention
only
firewood
and
fodder
let
inform
you
why
when
were
retreating
from
sventsyani
dare
not
touch
stick
wisp
hay
anything
you
see
were
going
away
would
get
all
wasn
your
excellency
and
again
timokhin
turned
the
prince
but
daren
our
regiment
two
officers
were
court
martialed
for
that
kind
thing
but
when
his
serenity
took
command
everything
became
straight
forward
now
see
light
then
why
was
forbidden
timokhin
looked
about
confusion
not
knowing
what
how
answer
such
question
pierre
put
the
same
question
prince
andrew
why
not
lay
waste
the
country
were
abandoning
the
enemy
said
prince
andrew
with
venomous
irony
very
sound
one
can
permit
the
land
pillaged
and
accustom
the
troops
marauding
smolensk
too
judged
correctly
that
the
french
might
outflank
they
had
larger
forces
but
could
not
understand
this
cried
prince
andrew
shrill
voice
that
seemed
escape
him
involuntarily
could
not
understand
that
there
for
the
first
time
were
fighting
for
russian
soil
and
that
there
was
spirit
the
men
such
had
never
seen
before
that
had
held
the
french
for
two
days
and
that
that
success
had
increased
our
strength
tenfold
ordered
retreat
and
all
our
efforts
and
losses
went
for
nothing
had
thought
betraying
tried
the
best
could
thought
out
everything
and
that
why
unsuitable
unsuitable
now
just
because
plans
out
everything
very
thoroughly
and
accurately
every
german
has
how
can
explain
well
say
your
father
has
german
valet
and
splendid
valet
and
satisfies
your
father
requirements
better
than
you
could
then
all
right
let
him
serve
but
your
father
mortally
sick
you
send
the
valet
away
and
attend
your
father
with
your
own
unpracticed
awkward
hands
and
will
soothe
him
better
than
skilled
man
who
stranger
could
has
been
with
barclay
while
russia
was
well
foreigner
could
serve
her
and
splendid
minister
but
soon
she
danger
she
needs
one
her
own
kin
but
your
club
they
have
been
making
him
out
traitor
they
slander
him
traitor
and
the
only
result
will
that
afterwards
ashamed
their
false
accusations
they
will
make
him
out
hero
genius
instead
traitor
and
that
will
still
more
unjust
honest
and
very
punctilious
german
and
they
say
skillful
commander
rejoined
pierre
don
understand
what
meant
skillful
commander
replied
prince
andrew
ironically
skillful
commander
replied
pierre
why
one
who
foresees
all
contingencies
and
foresees
the
adversary
intentions
but
that
impossible
said
prince
andrew
were
matter
settled
long
ago
pierre
looked
him
surprise
and
yet
they
say
that
war
like
game
chess
remarked
yes
replied
prince
andrew
but
with
this
little
difference
that
chess
you
may
think
over
each
move
long
you
please
and
are
not
limited
for
time
and
with
this
difference
too
that
knight
always
stronger
than
pawn
and
two
pawns
are
always
stronger
than
one
while
war
battalion
sometimes
stronger
than
division
and
sometimes
weaker
than
company
the
relative
strength
bodies
troops
can
never
known
anyone
believe
went
things
depended
arrangements
made
the
staff
should
there
making
arrangements
but
instead
that
have
the
honor
serve
here
the
regiment
with
these
gentlemen
and
consider
that
tomorrow
battle
will
depend
and
not
those
others
success
never
depends
and
never
will
depend
position
equipment
even
numbers
and
least
all
position
but
what
then
the
feeling
that
and
him
pointed
timokhin
and
each
soldier
prince
andrew
glanced
timokhin
who
looked
his
commander
alarm
and
bewilderment
contrast
his
former
reticent
taciturnity
prince
andrew
now
seemed
excited
could
apparently
not
refrain
from
expressing
the
thoughts
that
had
suddenly
occurred
him
battle
won
those
who
firmly
resolve
win
why
did
lose
the
battle
austerlitz
the
french
losses
were
almost
equal
ours
but
very
early
said
ourselves
that
were
losing
the
battle
and
did
lose
and
said
because
had
nothing
fight
for
there
wanted
get
away
from
the
battlefield
soon
could
lost
let
run
and
ran
had
not
said
that
till
the
evening
heaven
knows
what
might
not
have
happened
but
tomorrow
shan
say
you
talk
about
our
position
the
left
flank
weak
and
the
right
flank
too
extended
went
that
all
nonsense
there
nothing
the
kind
but
what
awaits
tomorrow
hundred
million
most
diverse
chances
which
will
decided
the
instant
the
fact
that
our
men
theirs
run
not
run
and
that
this
man
that
man
killed
but
all
that
being
done
present
only
play
the
fact
that
those
men
with
whom
you
have
ridden
round
the
position
not
only
not
help
matters
but
hinder
they
are
only
concerned
with
their
own
petty
interests
such
moment
said
pierre
reproachfully
such
moment
prince
andrew
repeated
them
only
moment
affording
opportunities
undermine
rival
and
obtain
extra
cross
ribbon
for
tomorrow
means
this
russian
army
hundred
thousand
and
french
army
hundred
thousand
have
met
fight
and
the
thing
that
these
two
hundred
thousand
men
will
fight
and
the
side
that
fights
more
fiercely
and
spares
itself
least
will
win
and
you
like
will
tell
you
that
whatever
happens
and
whatever
muddles
those
the
top
may
make
shall
win
tomorrow
battle
tomorrow
happen
what
may
shall
win
there
now
your
excellency
that
the
truth
the
real
truth
said
timokhin
who
would
spare
himself
now
the
soldiers
battalion
believe
wouldn
drink
their
vodka
not
the
day
for
that
they
say
all
were
silent
the
officers
rose
prince
andrew
went
out
the
shed
with
them
giving
final
orders
the
adjutant
after
they
had
gone
pierre
approached
prince
andrew
and
was
about
start
conversation
when
they
heard
the
clatter
three
horses
hoofs
the
road
not
far
from
the
shed
and
looking
that
direction
prince
andrew
recognized
wolzogen
and
clausewitz
accompanied
cossack
they
rode
close
continuing
converse
and
prince
andrew
involuntarily
heard
these
words
der
krieg
muss
raum
verlegt
werden
der
ansicht
kann
ich
nicht
genug
preis
geben
said
one
them
the
war
must
extended
widely
cannot
sufficiently
commend
that
view
said
the
other
der
zweck
ist
nur
den
feind
schwächen
kann
man
gewiss
nicht
den
verlust
der
privat
personen
achtung
nehmen
yes
the
only
aim
weaken
the
enemy
course
one
cannot
take
into
account
the
loss
private
individuals
agreed
the
other
extend
widely
said
prince
andrew
with
angry
snort
when
they
had
ridden
past
that
extend
were
father
son
and
sister
bald
hills
that
all
the
same
him
that
what
was
saying
you
those
german
gentlemen
won
win
the
battle
tomorrow
but
will
only
make
all
the
mess
they
can
because
they
have
nothing
their
german
heads
but
theories
not
worth
empty
eggshell
and
haven
their
hearts
the
one
thing
needed
tomorrow
that
which
timokhin
has
they
have
yielded
all
europe
him
and
have
now
come
teach
fine
teachers
and
again
his
voice
grew
shrill
you
think
shall
win
tomorrow
battle
asked
pierre
yes
yes
answered
prince
andrew
absently
one
thing
would
had
the
power
began
again
would
not
take
prisoners
why
take
prisoners
chivalry
the
french
have
destroyed
home
and
are
their
way
destroy
moscow
they
have
outraged
and
are
outraging
every
moment
they
are
enemies
opinion
they
are
all
criminals
and
thinks
timokhin
and
the
whole
army
they
should
executed
since
they
are
foes
they
cannot
friends
whatever
may
have
been
said
tilsit
yes
yes
muttered
pierre
looking
with
shining
eyes
prince
andrew
quite
agree
with
you
the
question
that
had
perturbed
pierre
the
mozhaysk
hill
and
all
that
day
now
seemed
him
quite
clear
and
completely
solved
now
understood
the
whole
meaning
and
importance
this
war
and
the
impending
battle
all
had
seen
that
day
all
the
significant
and
stern
expressions
the
faces
had
seen
passing
were
lit
for
him
new
light
understood
that
latent
heat
they
say
physics
patriotism
which
was
present
all
these
men
had
seen
and
this
explained
him
why
they
all
prepared
for
death
calmly
and
were
lightheartedly
not
take
prisoners
prince
andrew
continued
that
itself
would
quite
change
the
whole
war
and
make
less
cruel
have
played
war
that
what
vile
play
magnanimity
and
all
that
stuff
such
magnanimity
and
sensibility
are
like
the
magnanimity
and
sensibility
lady
who
faints
when
she
sees
calf
being
killed
she
kindhearted
that
she
can
look
blood
but
enjoys
eating
the
calf
served
with
sauce
they
talk
the
rules
war
chivalry
flags
truce
mercy
the
unfortunate
and
all
rubbish
saw
chivalry
and
flags
truce
they
humbugged
and
humbugged
them
they
plunder
other
people
houses
issue
false
paper
money
and
worst
all
they
kill
children
and
father
and
then
talk
rules
war
and
magnanimity
foes
take
prisoners
but
kill
and
killed
who
has
come
this
have
through
the
same
sufferings
prince
andrew
who
had
thought
was
all
the
same
him
whether
not
moscow
was
taken
smolensk
had
been
was
suddenly
checked
his
speech
unexpected
cramp
his
throat
paced
and
down
few
times
silence
but
his
eyes
glittered
feverishly
and
his
lips
quivered
began
speaking
there
was
none
this
magnanimity
war
should
war
only
when
was
worth
while
going
certain
death
now
then
there
would
not
war
because
paul
ivanovich
had
offended
michael
ivanovich
and
when
there
was
war
like
this
one
would
war
and
then
the
determination
the
troops
would
quite
different
then
all
these
westphalians
and
hessians
whom
napoleon
leading
would
not
follow
him
into
russia
and
should
not
fight
austria
and
prussia
without
knowing
why
war
not
courtesy
but
the
most
horrible
thing
life
and
ought
understand
that
and
not
play
war
ought
accept
this
terrible
necessity
sternly
and
seriously
all
lies
that
get
rid
falsehood
and
let
war
war
and
not
game
now
war
the
favorite
pastime
the
idle
and
frivolous
the
military
calling
the
most
highly
honored
but
what
war
what
needed
for
success
warfare
what
are
the
habits
the
military
the
aim
war
murder
the
methods
war
are
spying
treachery
and
their
encouragement
the
ruin
country
inhabitants
robbing
them
stealing
provision
the
army
and
fraud
and
falsehood
termed
military
craft
the
habits
the
military
class
are
the
absence
freedom
that
discipline
idleness
ignorance
cruelty
debauchery
and
drunkenness
and
spite
all
this
the
highest
class
respected
everyone
all
the
kings
except
the
chinese
wear
military
uniforms
and
who
kills
most
people
receives
the
highest
rewards
they
meet
shall
meet
tomorrow
murder
one
another
they
kill
and
maim
tens
thousands
and
then
have
thanksgiving
services
for
having
killed
many
people
they
even
exaggerate
the
number
and
they
announce
victory
supposing
that
the
more
people
they
have
killed
the
greater
their
achievement
how
does
god
above
look
them
and
hear
them
exclaimed
prince
andrew
shrill
piercing
voice
friend
has
late
become
hard
for
live
see
that
have
begun
understand
too
much
and
doesn
for
man
taste
the
tree
knowledge
good
and
evil
well
not
for
long
added
however
you
sleepy
and
time
for
sleep

said
prince
andrew
suddenly
pierre
replied
looking
prince
andrew
with
frightened
compassionate
eyes
before
battle
one
must
have
one
sleep
out
repeated
prince
andrew
came
quickly
pierre
and
embraced
and
kissed
him
good
bye
off
shouted
whether
meet
again
not
and
turning
away
hurriedly
entered
the
shed
was
already
dark
and
pierre
could
not
make
out
whether
the
expression
prince
andrew
face
was
angry
tender
for
some
time
stood
silence
considering
whether
should
follow
him
away
does
not
want
pierre
concluded
and
know
that
this
our
last
meeting
sighed
deeply
and
rode
back
gorki
entering
the
shed
prince
andrew
lay
down
rug
but
could
not
sleep
closed
his
eyes
one
picture
succeeded
another
his
imagination
one
them
dwelt
long
and
joyfully
vividly
recalled
evening
petersburg
natasha
with
animated
and
excited
face
was
telling
him
how
she
had
gone
look
for
mushrooms
the
previous
summer
and
had
lost
her
way
the
big
forest
she
incoherently
described
the
depths
the
forest
her
feelings
and
talk
with
beekeeper
she
met
and
constantly
interrupted
her
story
say
can
not
telling
right
you
don
understand
though
encouraged
her
saying
that
did
understand
and
really
had
understood
all
she
wanted
say
but
natasha
was
not
satisfied
with
her
own
words
she
felt
that
they
did
not
convey
the
passionately
poetic
feeling
she
had
experienced
that
day
and
wished
convey
was
such
delightful
old
man
and
was
dark
the
forest
and
had
such
kind
can
describe
she
had
said
flushed
and
excited
prince
andrew
smiled
now
the
same
happy
smile
then
when
had
looked
into
her
eyes
understood
her
thought
not
only
understood
her
but
was
just
that
inner
spiritual
force
that
sincerity
that
frankness
soul
that
very
soul
hers
which
seemed
fettered
her
body
was
that
soul
loved
her
loved
strongly
and
happily
and
suddenly
remembered
how
his
love
had
ended
did
not
need
anything
that
kind
neither
saw
nor
understood
anything
the
sort
only
saw
her
pretty
and
fresh
young
girl
with
whom
did
not
deign
unite
his
fate
and
and
still
alive
and
gay
prince
andrew
jumped
someone
had
burned
him
and
again
began
pacing
and
down
front

shed

talking
some

the

napoleon
had
not
yet
left

bedroom
and
was
finishing
his
toilet
slightly
snorting
and
grunting
presented
now
his
back
and
now
his
plump
hairy
chest
the
brush
with
which
his

was
rubbing
him
down
another

with
his

over

said
repeating
the
aide

words
they
are
forcing

them
much
the

hunching
his
back
and
presenting
his
fat
shoulders
all
right
let
monsieur
beausset
enter
and
fabvier
too
said
nodding
the

yes

and
the
aide

disappeared
through

the
tent

majesty
and
wearing

went
with
firm
quick
steps

meanwhile
were
busily
engaged
arranging
the
present

brought
from
the
empress
two
chairs
directly

entrance
but
napoleon
had
dressed
and
come
out
with
such
unexpected
rapidity
that
had
not
time
finish
arranging
the
surprise
napoleon
noticed
once
what
they
were
about
and
guessed
that
they
were
not
ready
did
not
wish
deprive
them
the
pleasure
giving
him
surprise
pretended
not
see
beausset
and
called
fabvier
him
listening
silently
and
with
stern
frown
what
fabvier
told
him
the
heroism
and
devotion
his
troops
fighting
salamanca
the
other
end
europe
with
but
one
thought
worthy
their
emperor
and
but
one
fear
fail
please
him
the
result
that
battle
had
been
deplorable
napoleon
made
ironic
remarks
during
fabvier
account
had
not
expected
that
matters
could
otherwise
his
absence
must
make
for
that
moscow
said
napoleon
see
you

added
and
summoned
beausset
who
that
time
had
prepared
the
surprise
having
placed
something
the
chairs
and
covered
with
cloth
beausset
bowed
low
with
that
courtly
french
bow
which
only
the
old
retainers
the
bourbons
knew
how
make
and
approached
him
presenting
envelope
napoleon
turned
him
gaily
and
pulled
his
ear
you
have
hurried
here
very
glad
well
what
paris
saying
asked
suddenly
changing
his
former
stern
expression
for
most
cordial
tone
sire
all
paris
regrets
your
absence
replied
beausset
was
proper
but
though
napoleon
knew
that
beausset
had
say
something
this
kind
and
though
his
lucid
moments
knew
was
untrue
was
pleased
hear
from
him
again
honored
him
touching
his
ear
very
sorry
have
made
you
travel
far
said
sire
expected
nothing
less
than
find
you
the
gates
moscow
replied
beausset
napoleon
smiled
and
lifting
his
head
absent
mindedly
glanced
the
right
aide
camp
approached
with
gliding
steps
and
offered
him
gold
snuffbox
which
took
yes
has
happened
luckily
for
you
said
raising
the
open
snuffbox
his
nose
you
are
fond
travel
and
three
days
you
will
see
moscow
you
surely
did
not
expect
see
that
asiatic
capital
you
will
have
pleasant
journey
beausset
bowed
gratefully
this
regard
for
his
taste
for
travel
which
had
not
till
then
been
aware
what
this
asked
napoleon
noticing
that
all
the
courtiers
were
looking
something
concealed
under
cloth
with
courtly
adroitness
beausset
half
turned
and
without
turning
his
back
the
emperor
retired
two
steps
twitching
off
the
cloth
the
same
time
and
said
present
your

from

for

the

not
clear
what
the

meant

spiking

with

the

apparently
seemed

done

said
pointing

that

glanced

sat
down
before

from

everyone
went
out

leaving
the

himself

his

not

the

out

beausset

the

was
more

was
evident
anyone

the

otherwise
napoleon
rode
over
the
plain
and
surveyed
the
locality
with
profound
air
and
silence
nodded
with
approval
shook
his

dubiously
and
without

around

the

guided

the

inspected

pondered
little

and
then
indicated
the

these
dispositions
which
are
very
obscure
and
confused
one
allows
oneself
regard
the
arrangements
without
religious
awe
his
genius
related
napoleon
orders
deal
with
four
points
four
different
orders
not
one
these
was
could
carried
out
the
disposition
said
first
that
the
batteries
placed
the
spot
chosen
napoleon
with
the
guns
pernetti
and
fouche
which
were
come
line
with
them
guns
all
were
open
fire
and
shower
shells
the
russian
fleches
and
redoubts
this
could
not
done
from
the
spots
selected
napoleon
the
projectiles
did
not
carry
the
russian
works
and
those
guns
shot
into
the
air
until
the
nearest
commander
contrary
napoleon
instructions
moved
them
forward
the
second
order
was
that
poniatowski
moving
the
village
through
the
wood
should
turn
the
russian
left
flank
this
could
not
done
and
was
not
done
because
poniatowski
advancing
the
village
through
the
wood
met
tuchkov
there
barring
his
way
and
could
not
and
did
not
turn
the
russian
position
the
third
order
was
general
campan
will
move
through
the
wood
seize
the
first
fortification
general
campan
division
did
not
seize
the
first
fortification
but
was
driven
back
for
emerging
from
the
wood
had
reform
under
grapeshot
which
napoleon
was
unaware
the
fourth
order
was
the
vice
king
will
occupy
the
village
borodino
and
cross
its
three
bridges
advancing
the
same
heights
morand
and
gdrard
divisions
for
whose
movements
directions
are
given
which
under
his
leadership
will
directed
against
the
redoubt
and
come
into
line
with
the
rest
the
forces
far
one
can
make
out
not
much
from
this
unintelligible
sentence
from
the
attempts
the
vice
king
made
execute
the
orders
given
him
was
advance
from
the
left
through
borodino
the
redoubt
while
the
divisions
morand
and
gerard
were
advance
simultaneously
from
the
front
all
this
like
the
other
parts
the
disposition
was
not
and
could
not
executed
after
passing
through
borodino
the
vice
king
was
driven
back
the
kolocha
and
could
get
farther
while
the
divisions
morand
and
gerard
did
not
take
the
redoubt
but
were
driven
back
and
the
redoubt
was
only
taken
the
end
the
battle
the
cavalry
thing
probably
unforeseen
and
not
heard
napoleon
not
one
the
orders
the
disposition
was
could
executed
but
the
disposition
said
that
after
the
fight
has
commenced
this
manner
orders
will
given
accordance
with
the
enemy
movements
and
might
supposed
that
all
necessary
arrangements
would
made
napoleon
during
the
battle
but
this
was
not
and
could
not
done
for
during
the
whole
battle
napoleon
was
far
away
that
appeared
later
could
not
know
the
course
the
battle
and
not
one
his
orders
during
the
fight
could
executed
chapter
xxviii
many
historians
say
that
the
french
did
not
win
the
battle
borodino
because
napoleon
had
cold
and
that
had
not
had
cold
the
orders
gave
before
and
during
the
battle
would
have
been
still
more
full
genius
and
russia
would
have
been
lost
and
the
face
the
world
have
been
changed
historians
who
believe
that
russia
was
shaped
the
will
one
man
peter
the
great
and
that
france
from
republic
became
empire
and
french
armies
went
russia
the
will
one
man
napoleon
say
that
russia
remained
power
because
napoleon
had
bad
cold
the
twenty
fourth
august
may
seem
logical
and
convincing
had
depended
napoleon
will
fight
not
fight
the
battle
borodino
and
this
that
other
arrangement
depended
his
will
then
evidently
cold
affecting
the
manifestation
his
will
might
have
saved
russia
and
consequently
the
valet
who
omitted
bring
napoleon
his
waterproof
boots
the
twenty
fourth
would
have
been
the
savior
russia
along
that
line
thought
such
deduction
indubitable
indubitable
the
deduction
voltaire
made
jest
without
knowing
what
was
jesting
when
saw
that
the
massacre
bartholomew
was
due
charles
stomach
being
deranged
but
men
who
not
admit
that
russia
was
formed

will
one
man
peter
that
the
french
empire
was
formed
and
the
war
with
russia
begun
the
will
one
man
napoleon
that
argument
seems
not
merely
untrue
and
irrational
but
contrary
all
human
reality
the
question
what
causes
historic
events
another
answer
presents
itself
namely
that
the
course
human
events
predetermined
from
high
depends
the
coincidence
the
wills
all
who
take
part
the
events
and
that
napoleon
influence
the
course
these
events
purely
external
and
fictitious
strange
first
glance
may
seem
suppose
that
the
massacre
bartholomew
was
not
due
charles
will
though
gave
the
order
for
and
thought
was
done
result
that
order
and
strange
may
seem
suppose
that
the
slaughter
eighty
thousand
men
borodino
was
not
due
napoleon
will
though
ordered
the
commencement
and
conduct
the
battle
and
thought
was
done
because
ordered
strange
these
suppositions
appear
yet
human
dignity
which
tells
that
each
not
more
least
not
less
man
than
the
great
napoleon
demands
the
acceptance
that
solution
the
question
and
historic
investigation
abundantly
confirms
the
battle
borodino
napoleon
shot
one
and
killed
one
that
was
all
done
the
soldiers
therefore
was
not
who
killed
people
the
french
soldiers
went
kill
and
killed
the
battle
borodino
not
because
napoleon
orders
but
their
own
volition
the
whole
army
french
italian
german
polish
and
dutch
hungry
ragged
and
weary
the
campaign
felt
the
sight
army
blocking
their
road
moscow
that
the
wine
was
drawn
and
must
drunk
had
napoleon
then
forbidden
them
fight
the
russians
they
would
have
killed
him
and
have
proceeded
fight
the
russians
because
was
inevitable
when
they
heard
napoleon
proclamation
offering
them
compensation
for
mutilation
and
death
the
words
posterity
about
their
having
been
the
battle
before
moscow
they
cried
vive
empereur
just
they
had
cried
vive
empereur
the
sight
the
portrait
the
boy
piercing
the
terrestrial
globe
with
toy
stick
and
just
they
would
have
cried
vive
empereur
any
nonsense
that
might
told
them
there
was
nothing
left
for
them
but
cry
vive
empereur
and
fight
order
get
food
and
rest
conquerors
moscow
was
not
because
napoleon
commands
that
they
killed
their
fellow
men
and
was
not
napoleon
who
directed
the
course
the
battle
for
none
his
orders
were
executed
and
during
the
battle
did
not
know
what
was
going
before
him
the
way
which
these
people
killed
one
another
was
not
decided
napoleon
will
but
occurred
independently
him
accord
with
the
will
hundreds
thousands
people
who
took
part
the
common
action
only
seemed
napoleon
that
all
took
place
his
will
and
the
question
whether
had
had
not
cold
has
more
historic
interest
than
the
cold
the
least
the
transport
soldiers
moreover
the
assertion
made
various
writers
that
his
cold
was
the
cause
his
dispositions
not
being
well
planned
former
occasions
and
his
orders
during
the
battle
not
being
good
previously
quite
baseless
which
again
shows
that
napoleon
cold
the
twenty
sixth
august
was
unimportant
the
dispositions
cited
above
are
not
all
worse
but
are
even
better
than
previous
dispositions
which
had
won
victories
his
pseudo
orders
during
the
battle
were
also
worse
than
formerly
but
much
the
same
usual
these
dispositions
and
orders
only
seem
worse
than
previous
ones
because
the
battle
borodino
was
the
first
napoleon
did
not
win
the
profoundest
and
most
excellent
dispositions
and
orders
seem
very
bad
and
every
learned
militarist
criticizes
them
with
looks
importance
when
they
relate
battle
that
has
been
lost
and
the
very
worst
dispositions
and
orders
seem
very
good
and
serious
people
fill
whole
volumes
demonstrate
their
merits
when
they
relate
battle
that
has
been
won
the
dispositions
drawn
weyrother
for
the
battle
austerlitz
were
model
perfection
for
that
kind
composition
but
still
they
were
criticized
criticized
for
their
very
perfection
for
their
excessive
minuteness
napoleon
the
battle
borodino
fulfilled
his
office
representative
authority
well
and
even
better
than
other
battles
did
nothing
harmful
the
progress
the
battle
inclined
the
most
reasonable
opinions
made
confusion
did
not
contradict
himself
did
not
get
frightened
run
away

the
night

dark
and
damp
scarcely
perceptible
moisture
was
descending
from
above
near
the

were
dimly
burning
among
the
french

and
the
distance
those

were
clearly
audible
napoleon
walked
about

the
fires
and
listened
these
sounds
and

the

resounded
and
died
away
the
prevailing

some
minutes
passed

the

then
fourth
and
fifth
boomed
solemnly
near
the

the

not

ceased
reverberate
before

rang
out
and
yet
more
were
heard

after

ordered
his
groom
get
the

ready
and
call
him
early
the

and
then
immediately
fell
asleep

next
morning
everybody
had
already
left

rattling
the
little
windows
and
his
groom
was
shaking
him
your
excellency
your
excellency
your
excellency
kept
repeating
pertinaciously
while
shook
pierre
the
shoulder
without
looking
him
having
apparently
lost
hope
getting
him
wake
what
has
begun

pierre
asked

said
the

all
the

gone
out
and
his
serene
highness
himself
rode
past
long
ago
pierre
dressed
hastily
and
ran
out
the
porch
outside
all
was
bright
fresh
dewy
and
cheerful
the
sun
just
bursting
forth
from
behind
cloud
that
had
concealed
was
shining
with
rays
still
half
broken
the
clouds
over
the
roofs
the
street
opposite
the

besprinkled

the
road
the

the

standing
before

cried
the

telling
the

follow
him
with

pierre
went
down
the
street
the
knoll
from
which
had
looked
the
field
battle
the
day
before
crowd
military
men
was
assembled
there
members
the
staff
could
heard
conversing
french
and
kutuzov
gray
head
white
cap
with
red
band
was
visible
his
gray
nape
sunk
between
his
shoulders
was
looking
through
field
glass
down
the
highroad
before
him
mounting
the
steps
the
knoll
pierre
looked
the
scene
before
him
spellbound
beauty
was
the
same
panorama
had
admired
from
that
spot
the
day
before
but
now
the
whole
place
was
full
troops
and
covered
smoke
clouds
from
the
guns
and
the
slanting
rays
the
bright
sun
rising
slightly
the
left
behind
pierre
cast
upon
through
the
clear
morning
air
penetrating
streaks
rosy
golden
tinted
light
and
long
dark
shadows
the
forest
the
farthest
extremity
the
panorama
seemed
carved
some
precious
stone
yellowish
green
color
its
undulating
outline
was
silhouetted
against
the
horizon
and
was
pierced
beyond
valuevo
the
smolensk
highroad
crowded
with
troops
nearer
hand
glittered
golden
cornfields
interspersed
with
copses
there
were
troops
seen
everywhere
front
and
the
right
and
left
all
this
was
vivid
majestic
and
unexpected
but
what
impressed
pierre
most
all
was
the
view
the
battlefield
itself
borodino
and
the
hollows
both
sides
the
kolocha
above
the
kolocha
borodino
and
both
sides
especially
the
left
where
the
voyna
flowing
between
its
marshy
banks
falls
into
the
kolocha
mist
had
spread
which
seemed
melt
dissolve
and
become
translucent
when
the
brilliant
sun
appeared
and
magically
colored
and
outlined
everything
the
smoke
the
guns
mingled
with
this
mist
and
over
the
whole
expanse
and
through
that
mist
the
rays
the
morning
sun
were
reflected
flashing
back
like
lightning
from
the
water
from
the
dew
and
from
the
bayonets
the
troops
crowded
together
the
riverbanks
and
borodino
white
church
could
seen
through
the
mist
and
here
and
there
the
roofs
huts
borodino
well
dense
masses
soldiers
green
ammunition
chests
and
ordnance
and
all
this
moved
seemed
move
the
smoke
and
mist
spread
out
over
the
whole
space
just
the
mist
enveloped
hollow
near
borodino
along
the
entire
line
outside
and
above
and
especially
the
woods
and
fields
the
left
the
valleys
and
the
summits
the
high
ground
clouds
powder
smoke
seemed
continually
spring
out
nothing
now
singly
now
several
time
some
translucent
others
dense
which
swelling
growing
rolling
and
blending
extended
over
the
whole
expanse
these
puffs
smoke
and
strange
say
the
sound
the
firing
produced
the
chief
beauty
the
spectacle
puff
suddenly
round
compact
cloud
smoke
was
seen
merging
from
violet
into
gray
and
milky
white
and
boom
came
the
report
second
later
puff
puff
and
two
clouds
arose
pushing
one
another
and
blending
together
and
boom
boom
came
the
sounds
confirming
what
the
eye
had
seen
pierre
glanced
round
the
first
cloud
which
had
seen
round
compact
ball
and
its
place
already
were
balloons
smoke
floating
one
side
and
puff
with
pause
puff
puff
three
and
then
four
more
appeared
and
then
from
each
with
the
same
interval
boom
boom
boom
came
the
fine
firm
precise
sounds
reply
seemed
those
smoke
clouds
sometimes
ran
and
sometimes
stood
still
while
woods
fields
and
glittering
bayonets
ran
past
them
from
the
left
over
fields
and
bushes
those
large
balls
smoke
were
continually
appearing
followed
their
solemn
reports
while
nearer
still
the
hollows
and
woods
there
burst
from
the
muskets
small
cloudlets
that
had
time
become
balls
but
had
their
little
echoes
just
the
same
way
trakh
takh
came
the
frequent
crackle
musketry
but
was
irregular
and
feeble
comparison
with
the
reports
the
cannon
pierre
wished
there
with
that
smoke
those
shining
bayonets
that
movement
and
those
sounds
turned
look
kutuzov
and
his
suite
compare
his
impressions
with
those
others
they
were
all
looking
the
field
battle
was
and
seemed
him
with
the
same
feelings
all
their
faces
were
now
shining
with
that
latent
warmth
feeling
pierre
had
noticed
the
day
before
and
had
fully
understood
after
his
talk
with
prince
andrew
dear
fellow
and
christ
with
you
kutuzov
was
saying
general
who
stood
beside
him
not
taking
his
eye
from
the
battlefield
having
received
this
order
the
general
passed
pierre
his
way
down
the
knoll
the
crossing
said
the
general
coldly
and
sternly
reply
one
the
staff
who
asked
where
was
going
there
too
too
thought
pierre
and
followed
the
general
the
general
mounted
horse
cossack
had
brought
him
pierre
went
his
groom
who
was
holding
his
horses
and
asking
which
was
the
quietest
clambered
onto
seized
the
mane
and
turning
out
his
toes
pressed
his
heels
against
its
sides
and
feeling
that
his
spectacles
were
slipping
off
but
unable
let
the
mane
and
reins
galloped
after
the
general
causing
the
staff
officers
smile
they
watched
him
from
the
knoll
chapter
xxxi
having
descended
the
hill
the
general
after
whom
pierre
was
galloping
turned
sharply
the
left
and
pierre
losing
sight
him
galloped
among
some
ranks
infantry
marching
ahead
him
tried
pass
either
front
them
the
right
left
but
there
were
soldiers
everywhere
all
with
the
same
preoccupied
expression
and
busy
with
some
unseen
but
evidently
important
task
they
all
gazed
with
the
same
dissatisfied
and
inquiring
expression
this
stout
man
white
hat
who
for
some
unknown
reason
threatened
trample
them
under
his
horse
hoofs
why
ride
into
the
middle
the
battalion
one
them
shouted
him
another
prodded
his
horse
with
the
butt
end
musket
and
pierre
bending
over
his
saddlebow
and
hardly
able
control
his
shying
horse
galloped
ahead
the
soldiers
where
there
was
free
space
there
was
bridge
ahead
him
where
other
soldiers
stood
firing
pierre
rode
them
without
being
aware
had
come
the
bridge
across
the
kolocha
between
gorki
and
borodino
which
the
french
having
occupied
borodino
were
attacking
the
first
phase
the
battle
pierre
saw
that
there
was
bridge
front
him
and
that
soldiers
were
doing
something
both
sides
and
the
meadow
among
the
rows
new
mown
hay
which
had
taken
notice
amid
the
smoke
the
campfires
the
day
before
but
despite
the
incessant
firing
going
there
had
idea
that
this
was
the
field
battle
did
not
notice
the
sound
the
bullets
whistling
from
every
side
the
projectiles
that
flew
over
him
did
not
see
the
enemy
the
other
side
the
river
and
for
long
time
did
not
notice
the
killed
and
wounded
though
many
fell
near
him
looked
about
him
with
smile
which
did
not
leave
his
face
why
that
fellow
front
the
line
shouted
somebody
him
again
the
left
keep
the
right
the
men
shouted
him
pierre
went
the
right
and
unexpectedly
encountered
one
raevski
adjutants
whom
knew
the
adjutant
looked
angrily
him
evidently
also
intending
shout
him
but
recognizing
him
nodded
how
have
you
got
here
said
and
galloped
pierre
feeling
out
place
there
having
nothing
and
afraid
getting
someone
way
again
galloped
after
the
adjutant
what
happening
here
may
come
with
you
asked
one
moment
one
moment
replied
the
adjutant
and
riding
stout
colonel
who
was
standing
the
meadow
gave
him
some
message
and
then
addressed
pierre
why
have
you
come
here
count
asked
with
smile
still
inquisitive
yes
yes
assented
pierre
but
the
adjutant
turned
his
horse
about
and
rode
here
tolerable
said
but
with
bagration
the
left
flank
they
getting
frightfully
hot
really
said
pierre
where
that
come
along
with
our
knoll
can
get
view
from
there
and
our
battery
still
bearable
said
the
adjutant
will
you
come
yes
come
with
you
replied
pierre
looking
round
for
his
groom
was
only
now
that
noticed
wounded
men
staggering
along
being
carried
stretchers
that
very
meadow
had
ridden
over
the
day
before
soldier
was
lying
athwart
the
rows
scented
hay
with
his
head
thrown
awkwardly
back
and
his
shako
off
why
haven
they
carried
him
away
pierre
was
about
ask
but
seeing
the
stern
expression
the
adjutant
who
was
also
looking
that
way
checked
himself
pierre
did
not
find
his
groom
and
rode
along
the
hollow
with
the
adjutant
raevski
redoubt
his
horse
lagged
behind
the
adjutant
and
jolted
him
every
step
you
don
seem
used
riding
count
remarked
the
adjutant
not
that
but
her
action
seems
jerky
said
pierre
puzzled
tone
why
she
wounded
said
the
adjutant
the
off
foreleg
above
the
knee
bullet
doubt
congratulate
you
count
your
baptism
fire
having
ridden
the
smoke
past
the
sixth
corps
behind
the
artillery
which
had
been
moved
forward
and
was
action
deafening
them
with
the
noise
firing
they
came
small
wood
there
was
cool
and
quiet
with
scent
autumn
pierre
and
the
adjutant
dismounted
and
walked
the
hill
foot
the
general
here
asked
the
adjutant
reaching
the
knoll
was
here
minute
ago
but
has
just
gone
that
way
someone
told
him
pointing
the
right
the
adjutant
looked
pierre
puzzled
what
with
him
now
don
trouble
about
said
pierre
onto
the
knoll
may
yes
you
see
everything
from
there
and
less
dangerous
and
come
for
you
pierre
went
the
battery
and
the
adjutant
rode
they
did
not
meet
again
and
only
much
later
did
pierre
learn
that
lost
arm
that
day
the
knoll
which
pierre
ascended
was
that
famous
one
afterwards
known
the
russians
the
knoll
battery
raevski
redoubt
and
the
french
grande
redoute
fatale
redoute
redoute
centre
around
which
tens
thousands
fell
and
which
the
french
regarded
the
key
the
whole
position
this
redoubt
consisted
knoll
three
sides
which
trenches
had
been
dug
within
the
entrenchment
stood
ten
guns
that
were
being
fired
through
openings
the
earthwork
line
with
the
knoll
both
sides
stood
other
guns
which
also
fired
incessantly
little
behind
the
guns
stood
infantry
when
ascending
that
knoll
pierre
had
notion
that
this
spot
which
small
trenches
had
been
dug
and
from
which
few
guns
were
firing
was
the
most
important
point
the
battle
the
contrary
just
because
happened
there
thought
one
the
least
significant
parts
the
field
having
reached
the
knoll
pierre
sat
down
one
end
trench
surrounding
the
battery
and
gazed
what
was
going
around
him
with
unconsciously
happy
smile
occasionally
rose
and
walked
about
the
battery
still
with
that
same
smile
trying
not
obstruct
the
soldiers
who
were
loading
hauling
the
guns
and
continually
running
past
him
with
bags
and
charges
the
guns
that
battery
were
being
fired
continually
one
after
another
with
deafening
roar
enveloping
the
whole
neighborhood
powder
smoke
contrast
with
the
dread
felt
the
infantrymen
placed
support
here
the
battery
where
small
number
men
busy
their
work
were
separated
from
the
rest
trench
everyone
experienced
common
and
were
family
feeling
animation
the
intrusion
pierre
nonmilitary
figure
white
hat
made
unpleasant
impression
first
the
soldiers
looked
askance
him
with
surprise
and
even
alarm
they
went
past
him
the
senior
artillery
officer
tall
long

pockmarked
man
moved
over
pierre
see
the
action
the
farthest
gun
and
looked
him
with
curiosity
young
round
faced
officer
quite
boy
still
and
evidently
only
just
out
the
cadet
college
who
was
zealously
commanding
the
two
guns
entrusted
him
addressed
pierre
sternly
sir
said
permit
ask
you
stand
aside
you
must
not
here
the
soldiers
shook
their
heads
disapprovingly
they
looked
pierre
but
when
they
had
convinced
themselves
that
this
man
the
white
hat
was
doing
harm
but
either
sat
quietly
the
slope
the
trench
with
shy
smile
politely
making
way
for
the
soldiers
paced
and
down
the
battery
under
fire
calmly
were
boulevard
their
feeling
hostile
distrust
gradually
began
change
into
kindly
and
bantering
sympathy
such
soldiers
feel
for
their
dogs
cocks
goats
and
general
for
the
animals
that
live
with
the
regiment
the
men
soon
accepted
pierre
into
their
family
adopted
him
gave
him
nickname
our
gentleman
and
made
kindly
fun
him
among
themselves
shell
tore
the
earth
two
paces
from
pierre
and
looked
around
with
smile
brushed
from
his
clothes
some
earth
had
thrown
and
how
you
not
afraid
sir
really
now
red

broad

soldier
asked
pierre
with
grin
that
disclosed
set
sound
white
teeth
are
you
afraid
then
said
pierre
what
else
you
expect
answered
the
soldier
she
has
mercy
you
know
when
she
comes
spluttering
down
out
your
innards
one
can
help
being
afraid
said
laughing
several
the
men
with
bright
kindly
faces
stopped
beside
pierre
they
seemed
not
have
expected
him
talk
like
anybody
else
and
the
discovery
that
did
delighted
them
the
business
soldiers
but
gentleman
wonderful
there
gentleman
for
you
your
places
cried
the
young
officer
the
men
gathered
round
pierre
the
young
officer
was
evidently
exercising
his
duties
for
the
first
second
time
and
therefore
treated
both
his
superiors
and
the
men
with
great
precision
and
formality
the
booming
cannonade
and
the
fusillade
musketry
were
growing
more
intense
over
the
whole
field
especially
the
left
where
bagration
fleches
were
but
where
pierre
was
the
smoke
the
firing
made
almost
impossible
distinguish
anything
moreover
his
whole
attention
was
engrossed
watching
the
family
circle
separated
from
all
else
formed
the
men
the
battery
his
first
unconscious
feeling
joyful
animation
produced
the
sights
and

the

was
now
replaced

especially
since

the

around
him

some
twenty

already

away
from

two
guns
were
smashed
and
cannon
balls
fell
more
and
more
frequently
the
battery
and
spent
bullets
buzzed
and
whistled
around
but
the
men
the

seemed
not
notice
this
and
merry
voices
and
jokes
were
heard
all

after
every

the
liveliness
increased
more
and

the

what

happening
there

absorbed
watching
this

over

was

struck
pale
young

who
letting
his

hang
down
was
walking
backwards
and
kept
glancing
uneasily
around
the

the

disappeared
amid
the
smoke
but
their

could
still

minutes
later
crowds
wounded

came
back
from

something
happened
the

beside
himself
with
terror
pierre
jumped
and
ran
back
the
battery
the
only
refuge
from
the
horrors
that
surrounded
him
entering
the
earthwork
noticed
that
there
were
men
doing
something
there
but
that
shots
were
being
fired
from
the
battery
had
time
realize
who
these
men
were
saw
the
senior
officer
lying
the
earth
wall
with
his
back
turned
were
examining
something
down
below
and
that
one
the
soldiers
had
noticed
before
was
struggling
forward
shouting
brothers
and
trying
free
himself
from
some
men
who
were
holding
him
the
arm
also
saw
something
else
that
was
strange
but
had
not
time
realize
that
the
colonel
had
been
killed
that
the
soldier
shouting
brothers
was
prisoner
and
that
another
man
had
been
bayoneted
the
back
before
his
eyes
for
hardly
had
run
into
the
redoubt
before
thin
sallow
faced
perspiring
man
blue
uniform
rushed
him
sword
hand
shouting
something
instinctively
guarding
against
the
shock
for
they
had
been
running
together
full
speed
before
they
saw
one
another
pierre
put
out
his
hands
and
seized
the
man
french
officer
the
shoulder
with
one
hand
and
the
throat
with
the
other
the
officer
dropping
his
sword
seized
pierre
his
collar
for
some
seconds
they
gazed
with
frightened
eyes
one
another
unfamiliar
faces
and
both
were
perplexed
what
they
had
done
and
what
they
were
next
taken
prisoner
have
taken
him
prisoner
each
was
thinking
but
the
french
officer
was
evidently
more
inclined
think
had
been
taken
prisoner
because
pierre
strong
hand
impelled
instinctive
fear
squeezed
his
throat
ever
tighter
and
tighter
the
frenchman
was
about
say
something
when
just
above
their
heads
terrible
and
low
cannon
ball
whistled
and
seemed
pierre
that
the
french
officer
head
had
been
torn
off
swiftly
had
ducked
pierre
too
bent
his
head
and
let
his
hands
fall
without
further
thought
who
had
taken
whom
prisoner
the
frenchman
ran
back
the
battery
and
pierre
ran
down
the
slope
stumbling
over
the
dead
and
wounded
who
seemed
him
caught
his
feet
but
before
reached
the
foot
the
knoll
was
met
dense
crowd
russian
soldiers
who
stumbling
tripping
and
shouting
ran
merrily
and
wildly
toward
the
battery
this
was
the
attack
for
which
ermolov
claimed
the
credit
declaring
that
only
his
courage
and
good
luck
made
such
feat
possible
was
the

there
the

and
our

shouting

pursued
them
far
beyond
the
battery
that
was
difficult
call
them
back
the
prisoners
were
brought
down
from
the

and
among
them
was

onto

where
had
spent
over
hour
and
that

not
find

there
were

down

stop
now

horrified
what

aimlessly
going
toward

moving
from

but
behind
the

the

was
still
high
and

the

near

something
seemed
seething
the
smoke
and
the
roar

and

did
not

the
chief
action
the

borodino
was
fought
within
the
seven

and
the

these

were

the
chief
action
the
day
took
place
open
space
visible
from
both
sides
and
was
fought
the
simplest
and
most
artless
way
the
battle
began
both
sides
with
cannonade
from
several
hundred
guns
then
when
the
whole
field
was
covered
with
smoke
two
divisions
campan
and
dessaix
advanced
from
the
french
right
while

troops
advanced
borodino
from
their
left
from
the
shevardino

where
napoleon
was
standing
the
fleches
were
two
thirds
mile
away
and
was
more
than
mile
the
crow
flies
borodino
that
napoleon
could
not
see
what
was
happening
there
especially
the
smoke
mingling
with
the
mist
hid
the
whole
locality
the
soldiers
dessaix
division
advancing
against
the
fleches
could
only
seen
till
they
had
entered
the
hollow
that
lay
between
them
and
the
fleches
soon
they
had
descended
into
that
hollow
the
smoke
the
guns
and
musketry
the
fleches
grew
dense
that
covered
the
whole
approach
that
side
through
the
smoke
glimpses
could
caught
something
black
probably
men
and
times
the
glint
bayonets
but
whether
they
were
moving
stationary
whether
they
were
french
russian
could
not
discovered
from
the
shevardino
redoubt
the
sun
had
risen
brightly
and
its
slanting
rays
struck
straight
into

shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
looked
the
fleches
the
smoke
spread
out
before
them
and
times
looked
the
smoke
were
moving
times
the
troops
moved
sometimes
shouts
were
heard
through
the
firing
but
was
impossible
tell
what
was
being
done
there
napoleon
standing
the
knoll
looked
through
field
glass
and
its
small
circlet
saw
smoke
and
men
sometimes
his
own
and
sometimes
russians
but
when
looked
again
with
the
naked
eye
could
not
tell
where
what
had
seen
was
descended
the
knoll
and
began
walking
and
down
before
occasionally
stopped
listened
the
firing
and
gazed
intently
the
battlefield
but
not
only
was
impossible
make
out
what
was
happening
from
where
was
standing
down
below
from
the
knoll
above
which
some
his
generals
had
taken
their
stand
but
even
from
the
fleches
themselves
which
this
time
there
were
now
russian
and
now
french
soldiers
alternately
together
dead
wounded
alive
frightened
maddened
even
those
fleches
themselves
was
impossible
make
out
what
was
taking
place
there
for
several
hours
amid
incessant
cannon
and

fire
now
russians
were

another
screamed
and
ran
back
again
from
the
battlefield
adjutants
had
sent
out
and
orderlies
from
his
marshals
kept
galloping
napoleon
with
reports
the
progress
the
action
but
all
these
reports
were
false
both
because
was
impossible
the
heat
battle
say
what
was
happening
any
given
moment
and
because
many
the
adjutants
did
not
the
actual
place
conflict
but
reported
what
they
had
heard
from
others
and
also
because
while
adjutant
was
riding
more
than
mile
napoleon
circumstances
changed
and
the
news
brought
was
already
becoming
false
thus
adjutant
galloped
from
murat
with
tidings
that
borodino
had
been
occupied
and
the
bridge
over
the
kolocha
was
the
hands
the
french
the
adjutant
asked
whether
napoleon
wished
the
troops
cross
napoleon
gave
orders
that
the
troops
should
form
the
farther
side
and
wait
but
before
that
order
was
given
almost
soon
fact
the
adjutant
had
left
borodino
the
bridge
had
been
retaken
the
russians
and
burned
the
very
skirmish
which
pierre
had
been
present
the
beginning
the
battle
adjutant
galloped
from
the
fleches
with
pale
and
frightened
face
and
reported
napoleon
that
their
attack
had
been
repulsed
campan
wounded
and
davout
killed
yet
the
very
time
the
adjutant
had
been
told
that
the
french
had
been
repulsed
the
fleches
had
fact
been
recaptured
other
french
troops
and
davout
was
alive
and
only
slightly
bruised
the
basis
these
necessarily
untrustworthy
reports
napoleon
gave
his
orders
which
had
either
been
executed
before
gave
them
could
not
and
were
not
executed
the
marshals
and
generals
who
were
nearer
the
field
battle
but
like
napoleon
did
not
take
part
the
actual
fighting
and
only
occasionally
went
within
musket
range
made
their
own
arrangements
without
asking
napoleon
and
issued
orders
where
and
what
direction
fire
and
where
cavalry
should
gallop
and
infantry
should
run
but
even
their
orders
like
napoleon
were
seldom
carried
out
and
then
but
partially
for
the
most
part
things
happened
contrary
their
orders
soldiers

ran
back
meeting
grapeshot
soldiers
ordered

where
they
were
suddenly
seeing
russians
unexpectedly
before
them
sometimes
rushed
back
and
sometimes
forward
and
the
cavalry
dashed
without
orders

the
flying
russians
this
way
two
cavalry
regiments
galloped
through
the
semenovsk
hollow
and
soon
they
reached
the
top
the
incline
turned
round
and
galloped
full
speed
back
again
the
infantry
moved
the

way
sometimes
running
quite
other

than
those
they
were
ordered
all

where
and
when

for

for

what
stake
what
dearest

his

and
sometimes
seems
that
safety
lies
running

sometimes
running

all

the
handsome

adjutant
with
the
long
hair
sighed
deeply
without
removing
his
hand
from
his
hat
and
galloped
back
where
men
were
being
slaughtered
napoleon
rose
and
having
summoned
caulaincourt
and
berthier
began
talking
them
about
matters

the

with

began
boldly
demonstrating
the
necessity
sending

swore
his
honor
that
the
russians
were
lost
the

would
give

napoleon
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
continued
pace
and
down
without
replying
belliard
began
talking
loudly
and
eagerly
the

around

began
the

said
napoleon
with
angry

the
adjutant
bent
his
head
affirmatively
and
began
report
but
the
emperor
turned
from
him
took
couple
steps
stopped
came
back
and
called

moving
his

the

galloped
claparede

and
few
minutes
later
the
young
guards
stationed
behind
the
knoll
moved
forward
napoleon
gazed
silently
that
direction
suddenly
said
berthier
can

though
there
was

sending

claparede
and
even
obvious

and

stopping

and
sending

the

all
said
the

they
all
asked
for

all
said

morosely
and
turned

beamed

and
glided
away
the

napoleon
was
experiencing

like
that
ever
lucky
gambler
who
after
recklessly
flinging
money
about
and
always
winning
suddenly
just
when
has
calculated
all
the

the

finds
that
the
more
considers
his

the
more
surely
loses
his

the

his
generals
the

the

preparations
had
been
made
the

and
the

himself
was
still
the

and
knew
that
was
now
even
more
experienced
and
skillful
than
before
even
the
enemy
was
the
same
austerlitz
and
friedland
yet
the
terrible
stroke
his
arm
had
supernaturally
become
impotent
all
the
old
methods
that
had
been
unfailingly
crowned
with
success
the
concentration
batteries
one

attack
reserves
break
the
enemy

and

attack
the

iron
all
these
methods
had
already
been
employed
yet
not
only
was
there
victory
but
from
all
sides
came
the
same
news
generals
killed
and
wounded
reinforcements
needed
the
impossibility
driving
back
the
russians
and
disorganization
among
his
own
troops
formerly
after
had
given
two
three
orders
and
uttered
few
phrases
marshals
and
adjutants
had
come
galloping
with
congratulations
and
happy

announcing
the

and
but
now
something
strange
was
happening
his
troops
despite
news
the
capture
the
fleches
napoleon
saw
that
this
was
not
the
same
not
all
the
same
what
had
happened
his
former
battles
saw
that
what
was
feeling
was
felt
all
the
men
about
him
experienced
the
art

all
their
faces
looked
dejected
and
they
all
shunned
one
another
eyes
only
beausset
could
fail
grasp
the
meaning
what
was
happening
but
napoleon
with
his
long
experience
war
well
knew
the
meaning
battle
not
gained
the
attacking
side
eight
hours
after
all
efforts
had
been
expended
knew
that
was
lost
battle
and
that
the
least
accident
might
now
with
the
fight
balanced
such
strained
center
destroy
him
and
his
army
when
ran
his
mind
over
the
whole
this
strange
russian
campaign
which
not
one
battle
had
been
won
and
which
not
flag
cannon
army
corps
had
been
captured
two
months
when
looked
the
concealed
depression
the
faces
around
him
and
heard
reports
the
russians
still
holding
their
ground
terrible
feeling
like
nightmare
took
possession
him
and
all
the
unlucky
accidents
that
might
destroy
him
occurred
his
mind
the
russians
might
fall
his
left
wing
might
break
through
his
center
himself
might
killed
stray
cannon
ball
all
this
was
possible
former
battles
had
only
considered
the
possibilities
success
but
now
innumerable
unlucky
chances
presented
themselves
and
expected
them
all
yes
was
like
dream
which
man
fancies
that
ruffian
coming
attack
him
and
raises
his
arm
strike
that
ruffian
terrible
blow
which
knows
should
annihilate
him
but
then
feels
that
his
arm
drops
powerless
and
limp
like
rag
and
the
horror
unavoidable
destruction
seizes
him
his
helplessness
the
news
that
the
russians
were
attacking
the
left
flank
the
french
army
aroused
that
horror
napoleon
sat
silently
campstool
below
the
knoll
with
head
bowed
and
elbows
his
knees
berthier
approached
and
suggested
that
they
should
ride
along
the
line
ascertain
the
position
affairs
what
what
you
say
asked
napoleon
yes
tell
them
bring
horse
mounted
and
rode
toward
semenovsk
amid
the
powder
smoke
slowly
dispersing
over
the
whole
space
through
which
napoleon
rode
horses
and
men
were
lying
pools
blood
singly

neither
napoleon
nor
any
his
generals
had
ever
before
seen
such
horrors
many
slain
such
small

the
roar
guns
that
had
not
ceased
for
ten

wearied
the
ear
and
gave
peculiar
significance
the

napoleon
rode
the

semenovsk
and
through
the
smoke
saw
ranks
men

unfamiliar
him
they
were
russians
the
russians
stood
serried
ranks
behind
semenovsk
village
and
its
knoll
and
their
guns
boomed
incessantly
along
their
line
and
sent
forth
clouds

was

battle
was
continuous
slaughter
which
could
avail
either
the
french
the
russians
napoleon
stopped
his
horse
and
again
fell
into
the
reverie
from
which
berthier
had
aroused
him
could
not
stop
what
was
going
before
him
and
around
him
and
was
supposed
directed
him
and
depend
him
and
from
its
lack
success
this
affair
for
the
first
time
seemed
him
unnecessary
and
horrible
one
the
generals
rode
napoleon
and
ventured
offer
lead
the
old
guard
into

ney
and
berthier
standing
near
napoleon
exchanged
looks
and
smiled
contemptuously
this
general
senseless
offer
napoleon
bowed
his
head
and
remained
silent
long
time
eight
hundred
leagues
from

will
not
have

said
and
turning
his

rode

sent

lids

nonchalantly
stretching
his
legs
approached
kutuzov
with
half
contemptuous
smile
his
lips
scarcely
touching
the
peak
his
cap
treated
his
serene
highness
with
somewhat
affected
nonchalance
intended
show
that
highly
trained
military
man
left
russians
make
idol
this
useless
old
man
but
that
knew
whom
was
dealing
with
der

their
own
set
the
germans
called
kutuzov
making
himself
very
comfortable
thought
wolzogen
and
looking
severely
the
dishes

kutuzov
began
report
the
old
gentleman
the
position

the
left
flank
barclay
had
ordered
him
and
himself
had
seen
and
understood
all

and
cannot
dislodge
them
for
lack

the
men

running
away
and
impossible

kutuzov
ceased
chewing
and
fixed
astonished
gaze
wolzogen
not
understanding
what
was
said
him
wolzogen
noticing
the
old

agitation
said
with

shouted
frowning
and
rising
quickly
went
wolzogen
how
how
dare
you
shouted
choking
and
making
threatening
gesture
with
his
trembling
arms
how
dare
you
sir
say
that
you

from
that
his

incorrect
and
that

than

was
about
make
rejoinder
but
kutuzov
interrupted
him
the

and
inform

the

tomorrow
said
kutuzov
sternly
all
were
silent
and
the
only
sound
audible
was
the
heavy
breathing
the
panting
old
general
they
are
repulsed
everywhere
for
which
thank
god
and
our
brave
army
the
enemy
beaten
and
tomorrow
shall
drive
him
from
the
sacred

said
kutuzov
crossing
himself
and
suddenly
sobbed
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
wolzogen
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
curling
his
lips
stepped
silently
aside
marveling
the

who
was
just
ascending

this
was

who
had
spent
the
whole

the
most
important
part
the
field
borodino
raevski
reported
that
the
troops
were
firmly
holding
their
ground
and
that
the
french
longer
ventured
attack
after
hearing
him
kutuzov
said
french
then
you
not
think
like
some
others
that
must
retreat
the
contrary
your
highness
indecisive
actions
always
the
most
stubborn

kaysarov
kutuzov
called
his

sit
down
and
write
out
the
order
the
day
for
tomorrow
and
you
continued
addressing
another
ride
along
the
line
and
announce
that
tomorrow
attack
while
kutuzov
was
talking
raevski
and
dictating
the
order
the
day
wolzogen
returned
from

and
said
that
general
barclay
wished
have
written
confirmation
the
order
the
field
marshal
had
given
kutuzov
without
looking
wolzogen
gave
directions
for
the
order
written
out
which
the
former
commander

avoid
personal
responsibility
very
judiciously
wished

and
means
that
mysterious
indefinable
bond
which
maintains
throughout
army

and
the
same
temper
known
the
spirit
the
army
and
which
constitutes
the
sinew
war
kutuzov
words
his
order
for
battle
next
day
immediately
became
known
from
one
end
the
army
the
other
was
far
from
being
the
same
words
the
same
order
that
reached
the
farthest
links
that
chain
the
tales
passing
from
mouth
mouth
different
ends
the
army
did
not
even
resemble
what
kutuzov
had
said
but
the
sense
his
words
spread
everywhere
because
what
said
was
not
the
outcome
cunning
calculations
but
feeling
that
lay
the
commander
chief
soul
that
every
russian
and
learning
that
tomorrow
they
were
attack
the
enemy
and
hearing
from
the
highest
quarters
confirmation
what
they
wanted
believe
the
exhausted
wavering
men
felt
comforted

inspirited

was
among
the
reserves
which
till
after

were

inactive
behind

under

artillery
fire
toward

the

having

was
moved
forward
into

where
thousands

perished
that

lost

from

especially
from

boomed
and

quarter
hour
passed
during
which
the
cannon

and
shells
all
flew
overhead
but
sometimes
several
men
were
torn
from
the
regiment
minute
and
the
slain
were
continually
being
dragged
away
and
the
wounded
carried
off
with

remained
for
those

three

apart
but
nevertheless
the
men
were
always
one
and
the

mood
all
alike
were
taciturn
and
morose
talk
was
rarely
heard
the
ranks
and
ceased
altogether
every

fingered
the

and
pulled

while
another
smoothed

refolded
his

and
put
his
boots
again
some
built
little
houses
the
tufts
the

from

all
seemed
fully
absorbed
these
pursuits
when

were
killed
wounded
when
rows

went
past
when
some
troops
retreated
and
when
great
masses
the
enemy
came
into
view
through
the
smoke
one
paid
any
attention
these
things
but
when
our
artillery

advanced
some
our
infantry
were
seen
move
forward
words

were
heard
all
sides
but
the
liveliest
attention
was
attracted

quite
apart

along

was
attracted

when

tucked
its

between
its

and
darted
aside
yells
and
shrieks
laughter
rose
from
the
whole
regiment
but
such
distractions
lasted
only
moment
and
for
eight
hours
the
men
had
been
inactive
without
food
constant
fear
death
and
their
pale
and
gloomy
faces
grew
ever
paler
and
gloomier
prince
andrew
pale
and
gloomy
like
everyone
the
regiment
paced
and
down
from
the
border
one
patch
another
the
edge
the

beside

with
head
bowed
and
arms
behind
his
back
there
was
nothing
for
him
and
orders
given
everything
went
itself
the
killed
were
dragged
from
the

the
wounded
carried
away
and
the

closed

andrew
considering
his
duty
rouse
the
courage
the
men
and
set
them

walked
about
among
the
ranks
but
soon
became
convinced
that
this
was
unnecessary
and
that
there
was
nothing
could
teach
them
all
the
powers
his
soul
every
soldier
there
were
unconsciously
bent
avoiding
the
contemplation
the
horrors
their
situation
walked
along
the
meadow
dragging
his
feet
rustling
the
grass
and
gazing
the
dust
that
covered
his
boots
now
took
big
strides
trying
keep
the
footprints
left
the
meadow
the
mowers
then
counted
his
steps
calculating
how
often
must
walk
from
one
strip
another
walk
mile
then
stripped
the
flowers
from
the
wormwood
that
grew
along
boundary
rut
rubbed
them
his
palms
and
smelled
their
pungent
sweetly
bitter
scent
nothing
remained

nothing
listened
with
weary
ears
the
ever
recurring

from

tore
the

gathered
near
the

the

approached

from

from

this

the

remembered
that

were
looking
him
shameful

said
the
adjutant
what
did
not
finish
speaking

and
the

moment
came
the

from
breaking

and
prince
andrew
started
one
side
raising
his
arm
and
fell

several
officers
ran
him
from
the
right
side
his
abdomen
blood
was
welling
out
making
large
stain
the

the
militiamen
with

behind
the

lay
his

with
his

breathing
heavily
and
noisily
what

waiting
for

along
the
peasants

and
took
him
his
shoulders
and
legs
but
moaned
piteously
and
exchanging
looks
they
set
him
down
again

him

him
all
the

again
took
him
the

laid
him

the

the

adjusting
the

started
hurriedly
along

trodden
down

the

now
that

said
the

joyfully
when
had
got
into

your

said
the
trembling
voice

who
had
run
and
was
looking
down
the
stretcher
prince
andrew
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
the
speaker
from
the

into
which
his
head
had
sunk
deep
and
again
his
eyelids
drooped
the

carried

the

flew
down

and
attentive

the

keeping

tried

drive
from
the
spot
disregarding
the

orders
the
soldiers
stood
leaning
against
their
stretchers
and
gazing
intently
trying
comprehend
the
difficult
problem
what
was
taking
place
before
them
from
the
tents
came

loud
angry
cries
and

plaintive
groans

close
one
the

and
there
stopped
awaiting
instructions
prince
andrew
opened
his
eyes
and
for
long
time
could
not
make
out
what
was
going
around
him
remembered
the

the
wormwood
the

the
whirling
black

and
his
sudden
rush
passionate

two
steps
from
him
leaning
against

and
talking
loudly
and
attracting

attention
stood

the

prince
andrew
looked
him
with
shining
eyes
and
experienced

comfort
but
isn
all
the

now
thought
and
what
will
there
and
what
has
there
been

why

there
was

one
the
doctors
came
out
the
tent
bloodstained
apron
holding
cigar
between
the
thumb
and
little
finger
one
his
small
bloodstained
hands
not
smear
raised
his
head
and
looked
about
him
but
above
the
level
the
wounded
men
evidently
wanted
little
respite
after
turning
his
head
from
right
left
for
some
time
sighed
and
looked
down
all
right
immediately
replied
dresser
who
pointed
prince
andrew
out
him
and
told
them
carry
him
into
the
tent
murmurs
arose
among
the
wounded
who
were
waiting
seems
that
even
the
next
world
only
the
gentry
are

remarked
one
prince

was
carried
and
laid
table
that
had
only
just
been
cleared
and
which
dresser
was
washing
down
prince
andrew
could
not
make
out
distinctly
what
was
that
tent
the
pitiful
groans
from
all
sides
and
the
torturing
pain
his
thigh
stomach
and
back
distracted
him
all
saw
about
him
merged
into
general
impression
naked
bleeding
human
bodies
that
seemed
fill
the
whole
the
low
tent
few
weeks
previously
that
hot
august
day
such
bodies
had
filled
the
dirty
pond
beside
the
smolensk
road
yes
was
the

flesh
the

the
sight
which
had
even
then
filled
him
with
horror
presentiment
there
were
three
operating
tables
the
tent
two
were
occupied
and
the
third
they
placed
prince
andrew
for
little
while
was
left
alone
and
involuntarily
witnessed
what
was
taking
place
the
other
two
tables
the
nearest
one
sat
tartar
probably
cossack
judging
the
uniform
thrown
down
beside
him
four
soldiers
were
holding
him
and
spectacled
doctor
was
cutting
into
his
muscular
brown
back
ooh
ooh
ooh
grunted
the
tartar
and
suddenly
lifting
his
swarthy
snub
nosed
face
with
its
high
cheekbones
and
baring
his
white
teeth
began
wriggle
and
twitch
his
body
and
utter
piercing
ringing
and
prolonged
yells
the
other
table
round
which
many
people
were
crowding
tall
well
fed
man
lay
his
back
with
his
head
thrown
back
his
curly
hair
its
color
and
the
shape
his
head
seemed
strangely
familiar
prince

several
dressers
were
pressing
his
chest
hold
him
down
one
large
white
plump
leg
twitched
rapidly
all
the
time
with
feverish
tremor
the
man
was
sobbing
and
choking
convulsively

was
pale

doing

quickly
turned
away
undress
him
what
are
you
waiting
for
cried
angrily
the
dressers
his
very
first
remotest
recollections
childhood
came
back
prince
andrew
mind
when
the
dresser
with
sleeves
rolled
began
hastily
undo
the
buttons
his
clothes
and
undressed
him
the
doctor
bent
down
over
the
wound
felt
and
sighed
deeply
then
made
sign
someone
and
the
torturing
pain
his
abdomen
caused
prince
andrew
lose
consciousness
when
came
himself
the
splintered
portions
his
thighbone
had
been
extracted
the
torn
flesh
cut
away
and
the
wound
bandaged
water
was
being
sprinkled
his
face
soon
prince
andrew
opened
his
eyes
the
doctor
bent
over
kissed
him
silently
the
lips
and
hurried
away
after
the
sufferings
had
been
enduring
prince
andrew
enjoyed
blissful
feeling
such
had
not
experienced
for
long
time
all
the
best
and
happiest
moments
his
life
especially
his
earliest
childhood
when
used
undressed
and
put
bed
and
when
leaning
over
him
his
nurse
sang
him
sleep
and
burying
his
head
the
pillow
felt
happy
the
mere
consciousness
life
returned
his
memory
not
merely
something
past
but
something
present
the
doctors
were
busily
engaged
with
the
wounded
man
the
shape
whose
head
seemed
familiar
prince
andrew
they
were
lifting
him
and
trying
quiet
him
show
ooh
ooh
his
frightened
moans
could
heard
subdued
suffering
and
broken
sobs
hearing
those
moans
prince
andrew
wanted
weep
whether
because
was
dying
without
glory
because
was
sorry
part
with
life
because
those
memories
childhood
that
could
not
return
because
was
suffering
and
others
were
suffering
and
that
man
near
him
was
groaning
piteously
felt
like
weeping
childlike
kindly
and
almost
happy
tears
the
wounded
man
was
shown
his
amputated
leg
stained
with
clotted
blood
and
with
the
boot
still
ooh
sobbed
like
woman
the
doctor
who
had
been
standing
beside
him
preventing
prince
andrew
from
seeing
his
face
moved
away
god
what
this
why
here
said
prince
andrew
himself
the
miserable
sobbing
enfeebled
man
whose
leg
had
just
been
amputated
recognized
anatole
kuragin
men
were
supporting
him
their
arms
and
offering
him
glass
water
but
his
trembling
swollen
lips
could
not
grasp
its
rim
anatole
was
sobbing
painfully
yes
yes
that
man
somehow
closely
and
painfully
connected
with

prince
andrew
not
yet
clearly
grasping
what
saw
before
him
what
the
connection
that
man
with
childhood
and
life
asked
himself
without
finding
answer
and
suddenly
new
unexpected
memory
from
that
realm
pure
and
loving
childhood
presented
itself
him
remembered
natasha
had
seen
her
for
the
first
time
the
ball
with
her
slender
neck
and
arms
and
with
frightened
happy
face
ready
for
rapture
and
love
and
tenderness
for
her
stronger
and
more
vivid
than
ever
awoke
his
soul
now
remembered
the
connection
that
existed
between
himself
and
this
man
who
was
dimly
gazing
him
through
tears
that
filled
his
swollen
eyes
remembered
everything
and
ecstatic
pity
and
love
for
that
man
overflowed
his
happy
heart
prince
andrew
could
longer
restrain
himself
and
wept
tender
loving
tears
for
his
fellow
men
for
himself
and
for
his
own
and
their
errors
compassion
love
our
brothers
for
those
who

that

which

chapter
xxxviii
the
terrible
spectacle
the
battlefield
covered
with
dead
and
wounded
together
with
the
heaviness
his
head
and
the
news
that
some
twenty
generals
knew
personally
had
been
killed
wounded
and
the
consciousness
the
impotence
his
once
mighty
arm
produced
unexpected
impression
napoleon
who
usually
liked
look
the
killed
and
wounded
thereby
considered
testing
his
strength
mind
this
day
the
horrible
appearance
the
battlefield
overcame
that
strength
mind
which
thought
constituted
his
merit
and
his
greatness
rode
hurriedly
from
the
battlefield
and
returned
the
shevardino
knoll
where
sat
his
campstool
his
sallow
face
swollen
and
heavy
his
eyes
dim
his
nose
red
and
his
voice
hoarse
involuntarily
listening
with
downcast
eyes
the
sounds
firing
with
painful
dejection
awaited
the
end
this
action
which
regarded
himself
participant
and
which
was
unable
arrest
personal
human
feeling
for
brief
moment
got
the
better
the
artificial
phantasm
life
had
served
long
felt
his
own
person
the
sufferings
and
death
had
witnessed
the
battlefield
the
heaviness
his
head
and
chest
reminded
him
the
possibility
suffering
and
death
for
himself
that
moment
did
not
desire
moscow
victory
glory
what
need
had
for
any
more
glory
the
one
thing
wished
for
was
rest
tranquillity
and
freedom
but
when
had
been
the
semenovsk
heights
the
artillery
commander
had
proposed
him
bring
several
batteries

those
heights
strengthen
the
fire
the
russian
troops
crowded

napoleon
had
assented
and
had
given
orders
that
news
should
brought
him
the
effect
those
batteries
produced
adjutant
came
now
inform
him
that
the
fire
two
hundred
guns
had
been
concentrated
the
russians
had
ordered
but
that
they
still
held
their
ground
our
fire
mowing
them
down
rows
but
still
they
hold
said
the
adjutant
they
want
more
said
napoleon
hoarse
voice
sire
asked
the
adjutant
who
had
not
heard
the
remark
they
want
more
croaked
napoleon
frowning
let
them
have
even
before
gave
that
order
the
thing
did
not
desire
and
for
which
gave
the
order
only
because
thought
was
expected
him
was
being
done
and
fell
back
into
that
artificial
realm
imaginary
greatness
and
again
horse
walking
treadmill
thinks
doing
something
for
itself
submissively
fulfilled
the
cruel
sad
gloomy
and
inhuman
role
predestined
for
him
and
not
for
that
day
and
hour
alone
were
the
mind
and
conscience
darkened
this
man
whom
the
responsibility
for
what
was
happening
lay
more
than
all
the
others
who
took
part
never
the
end
his
life
could
understand
goodness
beauty

the
significance
his
actions
which
were
too
contrary
goodness
and
truth
too
remote
from
everything
human
for
him
ever
able
grasp
their
meaning
could
not
disavow
his
actions
belauded
they
were
half

this

every

any

these

might
have
been
seized
with

what
they
were
doing
and
might
have
thrown
everything
and
run
away

but
though
toward

the

felt
all
the
horror
what
they
were
doing

they
would
have
been

off
some

power

they

though
only
one
artilleryman
survived
out
every
three
and
though
they
stumbled
and
panted
with
fatigue
perspiring
and
stained
with
blood
and
powder
the
cannon
balls
flew
just
swiftly
and
cruelly
from
both
sides
crushing
human
bodies
and
that
terrible
work
which
was
not
done
the

man
but
the
will
him
who
governs
men
and
worlds
continued
anyone
looking
the
disorganized
rear
the
russian
army
would
have
said
that
only
the
french
made
one
more
slight
effort
would
disappear
and
anyone
looking
the
rear
the
french
army
would
have
said
that
the
russians
need
only
make
one
more
slight
effort
and
the
french
would
destroyed
but
neither
the
french
nor
the
russians
made
that
effort
and
the
flame
battle
burned
slowly
out
the
russians
did
not
make
that
effort
because
they
were
not
attacking
the
french
the
beginning
the
battle
they
stood
blocking
the
way
moscow
and
they
still
did
the
end
the
battle
the
beginning
but
even
had
the
aim
the
russians
been
drive
the
french
from
their
positions
they
could
not
have
made
this
last
effort
for
all
the
russian
troops
had
been
broken
there
was
part
the
russian
army
that
had
not
suffered
the

and
though
still
holding
their

they
had

with
the
memory

their
former
victories

with
the
consciousness
that
they
had
captured
part
the

and
had
lost
only
quarter
their
men
and
still
had
their
guards
intact
twenty
thousand
strong
might
easily
have
made
that
effort
the
french
who
had
attacked
the
russian
army
order
drive
from
its
position
ought
have
made
that

for

the
russians

the

moscow

the

the
french
had
not
been
attained
and
all
their
efforts
and
losses
were
vain
but
the
french
did
not
make
that
effort
some
historians

that
napoleon
need
only
have
used
his
old
guards
who
were
intact

what

tell
the

say
that
why
this

those
are
its

the

not

says

this

fallacious

the

produced
the

there

indeed
human
reason
replies
every

appear
there

this
does
not
prove

the

caused

because
the

begin
ring
when
the

have
right
assume
that
the

hear
the

have
right
conclude
that
the

and
the

are
the

though
not

the

blow
when

cannot
agree
with

that
the

why
did

continually

innumerable

learned
military
authorities
quite
seriously
tell
that
kutuzov
should
have
moved
his
army
the
kaluga

long
before

and
that
somebody
actually
submitted
such
proposal
him
but
commander

especially
difficult
moment
has
always
before
him
not
one
proposal
but
dozens
simultaneously
and
all
these
proposals
based
strategics
and
tactics
contradict
each
other
commander

business
would
seem
simply
choose
one
these
projects
but
even
that
cannot
events
and
time
not
wait
for
instance
the
twenty
eighth
suggested
him
cross
the
kaluga
road
but
just
then
adjutant
gallops
from
miloradovich
asking
whether
engage
the
french
retire
order
must
given
him
once
that
instant
and
the
order
retreat
carries
past
the
turn
the
kaluga
road
and
after
the
adjutant
comes
the
commissary
general
asking
where
the
stores
are
taken
and
the
chief
the
hospitals
asks
where
the
wounded
are
and
courier
from

brings
letter
from
the
sovereign
which
does
not
admit
the
possibility
abandoning

the

rival
the

who
undermining
him

there
are
always
not

one

several
such
presents

diametrically

quite
freely
decide

defend

palpably

kutuzov
inspect

told
the

that

there
before

and
that

must
retreat
kutuzov
looked
him
silence
give
your
hand
said
and
turning
over
feel
the
pulse
added
you
are
not
well
dear
fellow
think
what
you
are
saying
kutuzov
could
not
yet
admit
the
possibility
retreating
beyond
moscow
without
battle
the

hill
four
miles
from
the
dorogomilov
gate
moscow
kutuzov
got
out
his
carriage
and
sat
down
bench
the
roadside
great
crowd
generals
gathered
round
him
and
count
rostopchin
who
had
come
out
from
moscow
joined
them
this
brilliant
company
separated
into
several
groups
who
all
discussed
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
the
position
the
state
the
army
the
plans
suggested
the
situation
moscow
and
military
questions
generally
though
they
had
not
been
summoned
for
the
purpose
and
though
was
not
called
they
all
felt
that
this
was
really
council
war
the
conversations
all
dealt
with
public
questions
anyone
gave
asked
for
personal
news
was
done
whisper
and
they
immediately
reverted
general
matters
jokes
laughter
smiles
even
were
seen
among
all
these
men
they
evidently
all
made
effort
hold
themselves
the
height
the
situation
demanded
and
all
these
groups
while
talking
among
themselves
tried
keep
near
the
commander
chief
whose
bench
formed
the
center
the
gathering
and
speak
that
might
overhear
them
the
commander
chief
listened
what
was
being
said
and
sometimes
asked
them
repeat
their
remarks
but
did
not
himself
take
part
the
conversations
express
any
opinion
after
hearing
what
was
being
said
one
other
these
groups
generally
turned
away
with
air
disappointment
though
they
were
not
speaking
anything
wished
hear
some
discussed
the
position
that
had
been
chosen
criticizing
not
the
position
itself
much
the
mental
capacity
those
who
had
chosen
others
argued
that
mistake
had
been
made
earlier
and
that

should
have
been
fought
two
days
before

again
spoke

this

and

the

serving

were

and
considering
the
possibility
defending
moscow
similar
manner
count
rostopchin
was
telling
fourth
group
that
was
prepared
die
with
the
city
train
bands
under
the
walls
the
capital
but
that
still
could
not
help
regretting
having
been
left

what
was
happening
and
that
had
known
sooner
things
would
have
been
different
fifth
group
displaying
the
profundity
their
strategic
perceptions
discussed
the
direction
the
troops
would
now
have
take
sixth
group
was
talking
absolute
nonsense
kutuzov
expression
grew
more
and
more
preoccupied
and
gloomy
from
all
this
talk
saw
only
one
thing
that
defend
moscow
was
physical
impossibility
the
full
meaning
those
words
that
say
utterly
impossible
that
any
senseless
commander
were
give
orders
fight
confusion
would
result
but
the
battle
would
still
not
take
place
would
not
take
place
because
the
commanders
not
merely
all
recognized
the
position
impossible
but
their
conversations
were
only
discussing
what
would
happen
after
its
inevitable
abandonment
how
could
the
commanders
lead
their
troops
field
battle
they
considered
impossible
hold
the
lower
grade
officers
and
even
the
soldiers
who
too
reason
also
considered
the
position
impossible
and
therefore
could
not
fight
fully
convinced
they
were
defeat
bennigsen
insisted
the
position
being
defended
and
others
still
discussed
the
question
was
longer
important
itself
but
only
pretext
for
disputes
and
intrigue
this
kutuzov
knew
well
bennigsen
who
had
chosen
the
position
warmly
displayed
his
russian
patriotism
kutuzov
could
not
listen
this
without
wincing
insisting
that
moscow
must
defended
his
aim
was
clear
daylight
kutuzov
the
defense
failed
throw
the
blame
kutuzov
who
had
brought
the
army
far
the
sparrow
hills
without
giving
battle
succeeded
claim
the
success
his
own
battle
were
not
given
clear
himself
the
crime
abandoning
moscow
but
this
intrigue
did
not
now
occupy
the
old
man
mind
one
terrible
question
absorbed
him
and
that
question
heard
reply
from
anyone
the
question
for
him
now
was
have
really
allowed
napoleon
reach
moscow
and
when
did
when
was
decided
can
have
been
yesterday
when
ordered
platov
retreat
was
the
evening
before
when
had

and
told

still
when
when
was
this
terrible
affair
decided
moscow
must
abandoned
the
army
must
retreat
and
the
order
must
given
give
that
terrible
order
seemed
him
equivalent
resigning
the
command
the
army
and
not
only
did
love
power
which
was
accustomed
the
honours
awarded
prince
prozorovski
under

had
served

galled
him
but
was
convinced
that
was

that
that
was

against

maintain

the

these
difficult
circumstances
and
that
all
the
world
alone
could
encounter
the
invincible
napoleon
without
fear
and
was
horrified
the
thought
the
order
had
issue
but
something
had
decided
and
these
conversations
around
him
which
were
assuming
too
free
character
must
stopped
called
the
most
important
generals

rising
from

year

his

the
larger

malasha
looked
down
from
the
oven
with
shy
delight
the
faces
uniforms
and
decorations
the
generals
who
one
after
another
came
into
the
room
and
sat
down
the
broad
benches
the
corner
under
the
icons
granddad
himself
malasha
her
own
mind
called
kutuzov
sat
apart
dark
corner
behind
the
oven
sat
sunk
deep
folding
armchair
and
continually
cleared
his
throat
and
pulled
the
collar
his
coat
which
though
was
unbuttoned
still
seemed
pinch
his
neck
those
who
entered
went
one
one
the
field

pressed
the
hands
some
and
nodded
others
his
adjutant
kaysarov
was
about
draw
back
the
curtain
the
window
facing
kutuzov
but
the
latter
moved
his
hand
angrily
and
kaysarov
understood
that
his
serene
highness
did
not
wish
his
face
seen
round
the
peasant
deal
table
which
lay
maps
plans
pencils
and
papers
many
people
gathered
that
the
orderlies
brought
another
bench
and
put
beside
the
table
ermolov
kaysarov
and
toll
who
had
just
arrived
sat
down
this
bench
the
foremost
place
immediately
under
the
icons
sat
barclay
tolly
his
high
forehead
merging
into
his
bald
crown
had
george
cross
round
his
neck
and
looked
pale
and
ill
had
been
feverish
for
two
days
and
was
now
shivering
and
pain
beside
him
sat
uvarov
who
with
rapid
gesticulations
was
giving
him
some
information
speaking
low
tones
they
all
did
chubby
little
dokhturov
was
listening
attentively
with
eyebrows
raised
and
arms
folded
his
stomach
the
other
side
sat
count
ostermann
tolstoy
seemingly
absorbed
his
own
thoughts
his
broad
head
with
its
bold
features
and
glittering
eyes
was
resting
his
hand
raevski
twitching
forward
the
black
hair
his
temples
was
his
habit
glanced
now
kutuzov
and
now
the
door
with
look
impatience
konovnitsyn
firm
handsome
and
kindly
face
was
lit
tender
sly
smile
his
glance
met
malasha
and
the
expression
his
eyes
caused
the
little
girl
smile
they
were
all
waiting
for
bennigsen
who
the
pretext
inspecting
the
position
was
finishing
his
savory
dinner
they
waited
for
him
from
four
till
six
clock
and
did
not
begin
their
deliberations
all
that
time
but
talked
low
tones
other
matters
only
when
bennigsen
had
entered
the
hut
did
kutuzov
leave
his
corner
and
draw
toward
the
table
but
not
near
enough
for
the
candles
that
had
been
placed
there
light
his
face
bennigsen
opened
the
council
with
the
question
are
abandon
russia
ancient
and
sacred
capital
without
struggle
are
defend
prolonged
and
general
silence
followed
there
was
frown
every
face
and
only
kutuzov
angry
grunts
and
occasional
cough
broke
the
silence
all
eyes
were
gazing
him
malasha
too
looked
granddad
she
was
nearest
him
and
saw
how
his
face
puckered
seemed
about
cry
but
this
did
not
last
long
russia
ancient
and
sacred
capital
suddenly
said
repeating
bennigsen
words
angry
voice
and
thereby
drawing
attention
the
false
note
them
allow
tell
you
your
excellency
that
that
question
has
meaning
for
russian
lurched
his
heavy
body
forward
such
question
cannot
put
senseless
the
question
have
asked
these
gentlemen
meet
discuss
military
one
the
question
that
saving
russia
better
give
moscow
without
battle
accepting
battle
risk
losing
the
army
well
moscow
that
the
question
which
want
your
opinion
and
sank
back
his
chair
the
discussion
began
bennigsen
did
not
yet
consider
his
game
lost
admitting
the
view
barclay
and
others
that
defensive
battle
fili
was
impossible
but
imbued
with
russian
patriotism
and
the
love
moscow
proposed
move
troops
from
the
right
the
left
flank
during
the
night
and
attack
the
french
right
flank
the
following
day
opinions
were
divided
and
arguments
were
advanced
for
and
against
that
project
ermolov
dokhturov
and
raevski
agreed
with
bennigsen
whether
feeling
necessary
make
sacrifice
before
abandoning
the
capital
guided
other
personal
considerations
these
generals
seemed
not
understand
that
this
council
could
not
alter
the
inevitable
course
events
and
that
moscow
was
effect
already
abandoned
the
other
generals
however
understood
and
leaving
aside
the
question
moscow
spoke
the
direction
the
army
should
take
its
retreat
malasha
who
kept
her
eyes
fixed
what
was
going
before
her
understood
the
meaning
the
council
differently
seemed
her
that
was
only
personal
struggle
between
granddad
and
long
coat
she
termed
bennigsen
she
saw
that
they
grew
spiteful
when
they
spoke
one
another
and
her
heart
she
sided
with
granddad
the
midst
the
conversation
she
noticed
granddad
give
bennigsen
quick
subtle
glance
and
then
her
joys
saw
that
granddad
said
something
long
coat
which
settled
him
bennigsen
suddenly
reddened
and
paced
angrily
and
down
the
room
what
affected
him
was
kutuzov
calm
and
quiet
comment
the
advantage
disadvantage
bennigsen
proposal
move
troops
night
from
the
right
the
left
flank
attack
the
french
right
wing
gentlemen
said
kutuzov
cannot
approve
the
count
plan
moving
troops
close
proximity
enemy
always
dangerous
and
military
history
supports
that
view
for
instance
kutuzov
seemed
reflect
searching
for
example
then
with
clear
naive
look
bennigsen
added
yes
take
the
battle
friedland
which
think
the
count
well
remembers
and
which
was
not
fully
successful
only
because
our
troops
were
rearranged
too
near
the
enemy
there
followed
momentary
pause
which
seemed
very
long
them
all
the
discussion
recommenced
but
pauses
frequently
occurred
and
they
all
felt
that
there
was
more
said
during
one
these
pauses
kutuzov
heaved
deep
sigh
preparing
speak
they
all
looked
him
well
gentlemen
see
that
who
will
have
pay
for
the
broken
crockery
said
and
rising
slowly
moved
the
table
gentlemen
have
heard
your
views
some
you
will
not
agree
with
but
paused
the
authority
entrusted
sovereign
and
country
order
retreat
after
that
the
generals
began
disperse
with
the
solemnity
and
circumspect
silence
people
who
are
leaving
after
funeral
some
the
generals
low
tones
and
strain
very
different
from
the
way
they
had
spoken
during
the
council
communicated
something
their
commander
chief
malasha
who
had
long
been
expected
for
supper
climbed
carefully
backwards
down
from
the
oven
her
bare
little
feet
catching
its
projections
and
slipping
between
the
legs
the
generals
she
darted
out
the
room
when
had
dismissed
the
generals
kutuzov
sat
long
time
with
his
elbows
the
table
thinking
always
the
same
terrible
question
when
when
did
the
abandonment
moscow
become
inevitable
when
was
that
done
which
settled
the
matter
and
who
was
blame
for
did
not
expect
this
said
his
adjutant
schneider
when
the
latter
came
late
that
night
did
not
expect
this
did
not
think
this
would
happen
you
should
take
some
rest
your
serene
highness
replied
schneider
but
they
shall
eat
horseflesh
yet
like
the
turks
exclaimed
kutuzov
without
replying
striking
the
table
with
his
podgy
fist
they
shall
too
only
chapter
that
very
time
circumstances
even
more
important
than
retreating
without
battle
namely
the
evacuation
and
burning
moscow
rostopchin
who
usually
represented
being
the
instigator
that
event
acted
altogether
different
manner
from
kutuzov
after
the
battle
borodino
the
abandonment
and
burning
moscow
was
inevitable
the
retreat
the
army
beyond
moscow
without
fighting
every
russian
might
have
predicted
not
reasoning
but
the
feeling
implanted
each
and
our
fathers
the
same
thing
that
took
place
moscow
had
happened
all
the
towns
and
villages
russian
soil
beginning
with
smolensk
without
the
participation
count
rostopchin
and
his
broadsheets
the
people
awaited
the
enemy
unconcernedly
did
not
riot
become
excited
tear
anyone
pieces
but
faced
its
fate
feeling
within
the
strength
find
what
should
that
most
difficult
moment
and
soon
the
enemy
drew
near
the
wealthy
classes
went
away
abandoning
their
property
while
the
poorer
remained
and
burned
and
destroyed
what
was
left
the
consciousness
that
this
would
and
would
always
was
and
present
the
heart
every
russian
and
consciousness
this
and
foreboding
that
moscow
would
taken
was
present
russian
moscow
society
those
who
had
quitted
moscow
already
july
and
the
beginning
august
showed
that
they
expected
this
those
who
went
away
taking
what
they
could
and
abandoning
their
houses
and
half
their
belongings
did
from
the
latent
patriotism
which
expresses
itself
not
phrases
giving
one
children
save
the
fatherland
and
similar
unnatural
exploits
but
unobtrusively
simply
organically
and
therefore
the
way
that
always
produces
the
most
powerful
results
disgraceful
run
away
from
danger
only
cowards
are
running
away
from
moscow
they
were
told
his
broadsheets
rostopchin
impressed
them
that
leave
moscow
was
shameful
they
were
ashamed
called
cowards
ashamed
leave
but
still
they
left
knowing
had
done
why
did
they
impossible
suppose
that
rostopchin
had
scared
them
his
accounts
horrors
napoleon
had
committed
conquered
countries
the
first
people
away
were
the
rich
educated
people
who
knew
quite
well
that
vienna
and
berlin
had
remained
intact
and
that
during
napoleon
occupation
the
inhabitants
had
spent
their
time
pleasantly
the
company
the
charming
frenchmen
whom
the
russians
and
especially
the
russian
ladies
then
liked
much
they
went
away
because
for
russians
there
could
question
whether
things
would
well
ill
under
french
rule
moscow
was
out
the
question
under
french
rule
would
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
they
went
away
even
before
the
battle
borodino
and
still
more
rapidly
after
despite
rostopchin
calls
defend
moscow
the
announcement
his
intention
take
the
wonder
working
icon
the
iberian
mother
god
and
fight
the
balloons
that
were
destroy
the
french
and
despite
all
the
nonsense
rostopchin
wrote
his
broadsheets
they
knew
that
was
for
the
army
fight
and
that
could
not
succeed
would
not
take
young
ladies
and
house
serfs
the
three
hills
quarter
moscow
fight
napoleon
and
that
they
must
away
sorry
they
were
abandon
their
property
destruction
they
went
away
without
thinking
the
tremendous
significance
that
immense
and
wealthy
city
being
given
over
destruction
for
great
city
with
wooden
buildings
was
certain
when
abandoned
its
inhabitants
burned
they
went
away
each
his
own
account
and
yet
was
only
consequence
their
going
away
that
the
momentous
event
was
accomplished
that
will
always
remain
the
greatest
glory
the
russian
people
the
lady
who
afraid
being
stopped
count
rostopchin
orders
had
already
june
moved
with
her
negroes
and
her
women
jesters
from
moscow
her
saratov
estate
with
vague
consciousness
that
she
was
not
bonaparte
servant
was
really
simply
and
truly
carrying
out
the
great
work
which
saved
russia
but
count
rostopchin
who
now
taunted
those
who
left
moscow
and
now
had
the
government
offices
removed
now
distributed
quite
useless
weapons
the
drunken
rabble
now
had
processions
displaying
the
icons
and
now
forbade
father
augustin
remove
icons
the
relics
saints
now
seized
all
the
private
carts
moscow
and
one
hundred
and
thirty
six
them
removed
the
balloon
that
was
being
constructed
leppich
now
hinted
that
would
burn
moscow
and
related
how
had
set
fire
his
own
house
now
wrote
proclamation
the
french
solemnly
upbraiding
them
for
having
destroyed
his
orphanage
now
claimed
the
glory
having
hinted
that
would
burn
moscow
and
now
repudiated
the
deed
now
ordered
the
people
catch
all
spies
and
bring
them
him
and
now
reproached
them
for
doing
now
expelled
all
the
french
residents
from
moscow
and
now
allowed
madame
aubert
chalme
the
center
the
whole
french
colony
moscow
remain
but
ordered
the
venerable
old
postmaster
klyucharev
arrested
and
exiled
for
particular
offense
now
assembled
the
people
the
three
hills
fight
the
french
and
now
get
rid
them
handed
over
them
man
killed
and
himself
drove
away
back
gate
now
declared
that
would
not
survive
the
fall
moscow
and
now
wrote
french
verses
albums
concerning
his
share
the
affair
this
man
did
not
understand
the
meaning
what
was
happening
but
merely
wanted
something
himself
that
would
astonish
people
perform
some
patriotically
heroic
feat
and
like
child
made
sport
the
momentous
and
unavoidable
event
the
abandonment
and
burning
moscow
and
tried
with
his
puny
hand
now
speed
and
now
stay
the
enormous
popular
tide
that
bore
him
along
with
chapter
helene
having
returned
with
the
court
from
vilna
petersburg
found
herself
difficult
position
petersburg
she
had
enjoyed
the
special
protection
grandee
who
occupied
one
the
highest
posts
the
empire
vilna
she
had
formed
intimacy
with
young
foreign
prince
when
she
returned
petersburg
both
the
magnate
and
the
prince
were
there
and
both
claimed
their
rights
helene
was
faced
new
problem
how
preserve
her
intimacy
with
both
without
offending
either
what
would
have
seemed
difficult
even
impossible
another
woman
did
not
cause
the
least
embarrassment
countess
bezukhova
who
evidently
deserved
her
reputation
being
very
clever
woman
had
she
attempted
concealment
tried
extricate
herself
from
her
awkward
position
cunning
she
would
have
spoiled
her
case
acknowledging
herself
guilty
but
helene
like
really
great
man
who
can
whatever
pleases
once
assumed
her
own
position
correct
she
sincerely
believed
and
that
everyone
else
was
blame
the
first
time
the
young
foreigner
allowed
himself
reproach
her
she
lifted
her
beautiful
head
and
half
turning
him
said
firmly
that
just
like
man
selfish
and
cruel
expected
nothing
else
woman
sacrifices
herself
for
you
she
suffers
and
this
her
reward
what
right
have
you
monseigneur
demand
account
attachments
and
friendships
man
who
has
been
more
than
father
the
prince
was
about
say
something
but
helene
interrupted
him
well
yes
said
she
may
that
has
other
sentiments
for
than
those
father
but
that
not
reason
for
shut
door
him
not
man
that
should
repay
kindness
with
ingratitude
know
monseigneur
that
all
that
relates
intimate
feelings
render
account
only
god
and
conscience
she
concluded
laying
her
hand
her
beautiful
fully
expanded
bosom
and
looking
heaven
but
for
heaven
sake
listen
marry
and
will
your
slave
but
that
impossible
you
won
deign
demean
yourself
marrying
you
said
helene
beginning
cry
the
prince
tried
comfort
her
but
helene
quite
distraught
said
through
her
tears
that
there
was
nothing
prevent
her
marrying
that
there
were
precedents
there
were
that
time
very
few
but
she
mentioned
napoleon
and
some
other
exalted
personages
that
she
had
never
been
her
husband
wife
and
that
she
had
been
sacrificed
but
the
law
religion
said
the
prince
already
yielding
the
law
religion
what
have
they
been
invented
for
they
can
arrange
that
said
helene
the
prince
was
surprised
that
simple
idea
had
not
occurred
him
and
applied
for
advice
the
holy
brethren
the
society
jesus
with
whom
was
intimate
terms
few
days
later
one
those
enchanting
fetes
which
helene
gave
her
country
house
the
stone
island
the
charming
monsieur
jobert
man
longer
young
with
snow
white
hair
and
brilliant
black
eyes
jesuit
robe
courte
was
presented
her
and
the
garden
the
light
the
illuminations
and
the
sound
music
talked
her
for
long
time
the
love
god
christ
the
sacred
heart
and
the
consolations
the
one
true
catholic
religion
affords
this
world
and
the
next
helene
was
touched
and
more
than
once
tears
rose
her
eyes
and
those
monsieur
jobert
and
their
voices
trembled
dance
for
which
her
partner
came
seek
her
put
end
her
discourse
with
her
future
directeur
conscience
but
the
next
evening
monsieur
jobert
came
see
helene
when
she
was
alone
and
after
that
often
came
again
lay
member
the
society
jesus
one
day
took
the
countess
roman
catholic
church
where
she
knelt
down
before
the
altar
which
she
was
led
the
enchanting
middle
aged
frenchman
laid
his
hands
her
head
and
she
herself
afterward
described
she
felt
something
like
fresh
breeze
wafted
into
her
soul
was
explained
her
that
this
was
grace
after
that
long
frocked
abbe
was
brought
her
she
confessed
him
and
absolved
her
from
her
sins
next
day
she
received
box
containing
the
sacred
host
which
was
left
her
house
for
her
partake
few
days
later
helene
learned
with
pleasure
that
she
had
now
been
admitted
the
true
catholic
church
and
that
few
days
the
pope
himself
would
hear
her
and
would
send
her
certain
document
all
that
was
done
around
her
and
her
this
time
all
the
attention
devoted
her
many
clever
men
and
expressed
such
pleasant
refined
ways
and
the
state
dove
like
purity
she
was
now
she
wore
only
white
dresses
and
white
ribbons
all
that
time
gave
her
pleasure
but
her
pleasure
did
not
cause
her
for
moment
forget
her
aim
and
always
happens
contests
cunning
that
stupid
person
gets
the
better
cleverer
ones
helene
having
realized
that
the
main
object
all
these
words
and
all
this
trouble
was
after
converting
her
catholicism
obtain
money
from
her
for
jesuit
institutions
which
she
received
indications
before
parting
with
her
money
insisted
that
the
various
operations
necessary
free
her
from
her
husband
should
performed
her
view
the
aim
every
religion
was
merely
preserve
certain
proprieties
while
affording
satisfaction
human
desires
and
with
this
aim
one
her
talks
with
her
father
confessor
she
insisted
answer
the
question
how
far
was
she
bound
her
marriage
they
were
sitting
the
twilight
window
the
drawing
room
the
scent
flowers
came
the
window
helene
was
wearing
white
dress
transparent
over
her
shoulders
and
bosom
the
abbe
well
fed
man
with
plump
clean
shaven
chin
pleasant
firm
mouth
and
white
hands
meekly
folded
his
knees
sat
close
helene
and
with
subtle
smile
his
lips
and
peaceful
look
delight
her
beauty
occasionally
glanced
her
face
explained
his
opinion
the
subject
helene
with
uneasy
smile
looked
his
curly
hair
and
his
plump
clean
shaven
blackish
cheeks
and
every
moment
expected
the
conversation
take
fresh
turn
but
the
abbe
though
evidently
enjoyed
the
beauty
his
companion
was
absorbed
his
mastery
the
matter
the
course
the
father
confessor
arguments
ran
follows
ignorant
the
import

you
were
undertaking

who
his

the

without

you
married
again
with

your
sin
might
forgiven
but
the
question
again
twofold
one
firstly
but
suddenly
helene
who
was
getting
bored
said
with
one
her
bewitching
smiles
but
think
that
having
espoused
the
true
religion
cannot
bound
what
false
religion
laid
upon
the
director
her
conscience
was
astounded

the
case

said
with

and
began
refuting

chapter
vii
helene
understood
that
the
question
was
very
simple
and
easy
from
the
ecclesiastical
point
view
and
that
her
directors
were
making
difficulties
only
because
they
were
apprehensive
how
the
matter
would
regarded
the
secular
authorities
she
decided
that
was
necessary
prepare
the
opinion
society
she
provoked
the
jealousy
the
elderly
magnate
and
told
him
what
she
had
told
her
other
suitor
that
she
put
the
matter
that
the
only
way
for
him
obtain
right
over
her
was
marry
her
the
elderly
magnate
was
first
much
taken
aback
this
suggestion
marriage
with
woman
whose
husband
was
alive
the
younger
man
had
been
but
helene
imperturbable
conviction
that
was
simple
and
natural
marrying
maiden
had
its
effect
him
too
had
helene
herself
shown
the
least
sign
hesitation
shame
secrecy
her
cause
would
certainly
have
been
lost
but
not
only
did
she
show
signs
secrecy
shame
the
contrary
with
good
natured
naivete
she
told
her
intimate
friends
and
these
were
all
petersburg
that
both
the
prince
and
the
magnate
had
proposed
her
and
that
she
loved
both
and
was
afraid
grieving
either
rumor
immediately
spread
petersburg
not
that
helene
wanted
divorced
from
her
husband
had
such
report
spread
many
would
have
opposed
illegal
intention
but
simply
that
the
unfortunate
and
interesting
helene
was
doubt
which
the
two
men
she
should
marry
the
question
was
longer
whether
this
was
possible
but
only
which
was
the
better
match
and
how
the
matter
would
regarded
court
there
were
true
some
rigid
individuals
unable
rise
the
height
such
question
who
saw
the
project
desecration
the
sacrament
marriage
but
there
were
not
many
such
and
they
remained
silent
while
the
majority
were
interested
helene
good
fortune
and
the
question
which
match
would
the
more
advantageous
whether
was
right
wrong
remarry
while
one
had
husband
living
they
did
not
discuss
for
that
question
had
evidently
been
settled
people
wiser
than
you
they
said
and
doubt
the
correctness
that
decision
would
risk
exposing
one
stupidity
and
incapacity

marya

who
had
come

that
summer

contrary
the
general
one
meeting

ball
she
stopped
her
the
middle
the
room
and
amid
general
silence
said
her
gruff
voice

perhaps
you
think
you
have
invented

and
with
these
words
marya
dmitrievna
turning
her
wide
sleeves
with
her
usual
threatening
gesture
and
glancing
sternly
round
moved
across
the
room
though
people
were
afraid
marya
dmitrievna
she
was
regarded
petersburg
buffoon
and
what
she
had
said
they
only
noticed
and
repeated

the
one
coarse
word
she
had
used
supposing
the
whole
sting
her
remark
lie
that
word
prince
vasili
who
late
very
often
forgot
what
had
said
and
repeated
one
and
the
same
thing
hundred
times
remarked
his
daughter
whenever
chanced
see
her
helene
have
word
say
you
and
would
lead
her
aside
drawing
her
hand
downward

heard
certain
projects
concerning

dear
child
you
know
how
your

rejoices
know
that
you
you
have
suffered
much
but
dear
child
consult
only
your
own
heart
that
all
have
say
and
concealing
his
unvarying
emotion
would
press
his
cheek
against
his
daughter
and
move
away
bilibin
who
had
not
lost
his
reputation
exceedingly
clever
man
and
who
was
one
the
disinterested
friends
brilliant
woman
helene
always
has
men
friends
who
can
never
change
into
lovers
once
gave
her
his
view
the
matter
small
and
intimate
gathering

bilibin
said
helene
she
always
called
friends
that
sort
their
surnames
and
she
touched
his
coat
sleeve
with
her
white
beringed
fingers
tell
you
would
sister
what
ought
which
the
two
bilibin
wrinkled
the
skin
over
his
eyebrows
and
pondered
with
smile
his
lips
you
are
not
taking
unawares
you

said
true

thought
and
thought
again
about
your
affair
you
see
you
marry
the

meant
the
younger
man
and
crooked
one
finger
you
forever
lose
the
chance
marrying
the
other
and
you
will
displease
the
court
besides
you
know
there
some
kind
connection
but
you
marry
the
old
count
you
will
make
his
last
days
happy
and
widow
the
grand
the
prince
would
longer
making
mesalliance

and
bilibin
smoothed
out
his
forehead

said
helene
beaming
and
again
touching
bilibin
sleeve
but
love
them
you
know
and
don
want
distress
either
them
would
give
life
for
the
happiness

both
bilibin
shrugged
his
shoulders
much
say
that
not
even
could
help
that
difficulty
une

that
what
called
putting
things
squarely
she
would
like

all
three
the

time
thought
masterly

but
tell
how
will
your

look

bilibin
asked
his
reputation
being
well
established
that
did
not
fear
ask
naive
question

said
helene
who
for
some
reason
imagined
that

too
loved
her

anything
for
bilibin
puckered
his
skin
preparation
for
something
witty
even
divorce
you
said
helene
laughed
among
those
who
ventured

the
justifiability
the
proposed

was

she
was
continually
tormented
jealousy
her

and
now
that
jealousy
concerned
subject
near
her
own
heart
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
the
idea
she
consulted
russian
priest
the
possibility
divorce
and
remarriage
during
husband
lifetime
and
the
priest
told
her
that
was
impossible
and
her
delight
showed
her
text
the
gospel
which
seemed
him
plainly
forbids
remarriage
while
the
husband
alive
armed
with
these
arguments
which
appeared
her
unanswerable
she
drove
her
daughter
early
one
morning
find
her
alone
having
listened
her

smiled
blandly
and
ironically
but
says
plainly
whosoever

the
old

changing
from

she
always

that

quite
clear
into

which
suited

then
the

respectfully
and

the

took
notice

the

nodded
her

and
sidled
out
the

thought
the
old
princess
all
her
convictions
dissipated
the
appearance

she
right
but
how
that
our
irrecoverable
youth
did
not

simple
she
thought
she
got
into
her
carriage
the
beginning
august
helene
affairs
were
clearly
defined
and
she
wrote
letter
her
husband
who
she
imagined
loved
her
very
much
informing
him
her
intention
marry
and
her
having
embraced
the
one

this
letter
was
brought

house
when
was

borodino
chapter

toward
the
end
the
battle
borodino
pierre
having
run
down
from
raevski
battery
second
time
made
his
way
through
gully
knyazkovo
with
crowd
soldiers
reached
the
dressing
station
and
seeing
blood
and
hearing
cries
and
groans
hurried
still
entangled
the
crowds
soldiers
the
one
thing
now
desired
with
his
whole
soul
was
get
away
quickly
from
the
terrible
sensations
amid
which
had
lived
that
day
and
return
ordinary
conditions
life
and
sleep
quietly
room
his
own
bed
felt
that
only
the
ordinary
conditions
life
would
able
understand
himself
and
all
had
seen
and
felt
but
such
ordinary
conditions
life
were
nowhere
found
though
shells
and
bullets
did
not
whistle
over
the
road
along
which
was
going
still
all
sides
there
was
what
there
had
been
the
field
battle
there
were
still
the
same
suffering
exhausted
and
sometimes
strangely
indifferent
faces
the
same
blood
the
same
soldiers
overcoats
the
same
sounds
firing
which
though
distant
now
still
aroused
terror
and
besides
this
there
were
the
foul
air
and
the
dust
having
gone
couple
miles
along
the
mozhaysk
road
pierre
sat
down
the
roadside
dusk
had
fallen
and
the
roar
guns
died
away
pierre
lay
leaning
his
elbow
for
long
time
gazing
the
shadows
that
moved
past
him
the
darkness
was
continually
imagining
that
cannon
ball
was
flying
toward
him
with
terrific
whizz
and
then
shuddered
and
sat
had
idea
how
long
had
been
there
the
middle
the
night
three
soldiers
having
brought
some
firewood
settled
down
near
him
and
began
lighting
fire
the
soldiers
who
threw
sidelong
glances
pierre
got
the
fire
burn
and
placed
iron
pot
into
which
they
broke
some
dried
bread
and
put
little
dripping
the
pleasant
odor
greasy
viands
mingled
with
the
smell
smoke
pierre
sat
and
sighed
the
three
soldiers
were
eating
and
talking
among
themselves
taking
notice
him
and
who
may
you
one
them
suddenly
asked
pierre
evidently
meaning
what
pierre
himself
had
mind
namely
you
want
eat
give
you
some
food
only
let
know
whether
you
are
honest
man
said
pierre
feeling
necessary
minimize
his
social
position
much
possible
nearer
the
soldiers
and
better
understood
them
rights
militia
officer
but
men

asked
and
handed

spoon
after
licking
clean
pierre
sat
down
the
fire
and
began
eating
the
mash
they
called
the
food
the
cauldron
and
thought
more
delicious
than
any
food
had
ever
tasted
sat
bending
greedily
over
helping
himself
large
spoonfuls
and
chewing
one
after
another
his
face
was
lit
the
fire
and
the
soldiers
looked
him

the
soldiers
walked
with
pierre

the
time
they
got
near
mozhaysk
and
began
ascending
the
steep
hill
into
the
town
the
cocks
were
already
crowing
pierre
went
with
the
soldiers
quite
forgetting
that
his
inn
was
the
bottom
the
hill
and
that
had
already
passed
would
not
soon
have

and
turned
with
his
groom
toward
the
inn

them
something

and
felt
his
pocket
better
not
said
another
inner
voice
there
was
not
room
had
the
inn
they
were
all
occupied
pierre
went
out
into
the
yard
and
covering
himself
head
and
all
lay
down
his
carriage
chapter
scarcely
had
pierre
laid
his
head
the
pillow
before
felt
himself
falling
asleep
but
suddenly
almost
with
the
distinctness
reality
heard
the
boom
boom
boom
firing
the
thud
projectiles
groans
and
cries
and
smelled
blood
and
powder
and
feeling
horror
and
dread
death
seized
him
filled
with
fright
opened
his
eyes
and
lifted
his
head
from
under
his
cloak
all
was
tranquil
the
yard
only
someone
orderly
passed
through
the
gateway
splashing
through
the
mud
and
talked
the
innkeeper
above
pierre
head
some
pigeons
disturbed
the
movement

made

under

that
moment
could
see
the
clear
starry

between
the

penthouses

there
more
that
thought
covering
his
head
again
what
terrible

and
how
shamefully
yielded
but
they
they
were
steady
and
calm
all
the
time
the

were
the
soldiers
those
who
had
been
the
battery
those
who
had
given
him
food
and
those
who
had
prayed
before
the

those
strange
men
had
not

out
clearly
and
sharply
from
everyone

imbued
what

what
they
are

how
cast
off
all
the
superfluous
devilish

the
memory
the
dinner
the
english
club
when
had
challenged
dolokhov
flashed
through
pierre
mind
and
then
remembered
his
benefactor
torzhok
and
now
picture
solemn
meeting
the
lodge
presented
itself
his
mind
was
taking
place
the
english
club
and
someone
near
and
dear
him
sat
the
end
the
table
yes
that
benefactor
but
died
thought
pierre
yes
died
and
did
not
know
was
alive
how
sorry
that
died
and
how
glad
that
alive
again
one
side
the
table
sat
anatole
dolokhov
nesvitski
denisov
and
others
like
them
his
dream
the
category
which
these
men
belonged
was
clearly
defined
his
mind
the
category
those
termed
they
and
heard
those
people
anatole
and
dolokhov
shouting
and
singing
loudly
yet
through
their
shouting
the
voice
his
benefactor
was
heard
speaking
all
the
time
and
the
sound
his
words
was
weighty
and
uninterrupted
the
booming
the
battlefield
but
pleasant
and
comforting
pierre
did
not
understand
what
his
benefactor
was
saying
but
knew
the
categories
thoughts
were
also
quite
distinct
his
dream
that
was
talking
goodness
and
the
possibility
being
what
they
were
and
they
with
their
simple
kind
firm
faces
surrounded
his
benefactor
all
sides
but
though
they
were
kindly
they
did
not
look
pierre
and
did
not
know
him
wishing
speak
and
attract
their
attention
got
but
that
moment
his
legs
grew
cold
and
bare
felt
ashamed
and
with
one
arm
covered
his
legs
from
which
his
cloak
had
fact
slipped
for
moment
was
rearranging
his
cloak
pierre
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
same
penthouse
roofs
posts
and
yard
but
now
they
were
all
bluish
lit
and
glittering
with
frost
dew
dawn
thought
pierre
but
that
not
what
want
want
hear
and
understand
benefactor
words
again
covered
himself
with
his
cloak
but
now
neither
the
lodge
nor
his
benefactor
was
there
there
were
only
thoughts
clearly
expressed
words
thoughts
that
someone
was
uttering
that
himself
was
formulating
afterwards
when
recalled
those
thoughts
pierre
was
convinced
that
someone
outside
himself
had
spoken
them
though
the
impressions
that
day
had
evoked
them
had
never
seemed
him
been
able
think
and
express
his
thoughts
like
that
when
awake
endure
war
the
most
difficult
subordination
man
freedom
the
law
god
the
voice
had
said
simplicity
submission
the
will
god
you
cannot
escape
from
him
and
they
are
simple
they
not
talk
but
act
the
spoken
word
silver
but
the
unspoken
golden
man
can
master
nothing
while
fears
death
but
who
does
not
fear
possesses
all
there
were
suffering
man
would
not
know
his
limitations
would
not
know
himself
the
hardest
thing
pierre
went
thinking
hearing
his
dream
able
your
soul
unite
the
meaning
all
unite
all
asked
himself
not
unite
thoughts
cannot
united
but
harness
all
these
thoughts
together
what
need
yes
one
must
harness
them
must
harness
them
repeated
himself
with
inward
rapture
feeling
that
these
words
and
they
alone
expressed
what
wanted
say
and
solved
the
question
that
tormented
him
yes
one
must
harness
time
harness
time
harness
time
harness
your
excellency
your
excellency
some
voice
was
repeating
must
harness
time
harness
was
the
voice
the
groom
trying
wake
him
the
sun
shone
straight
into
pierre
face
glanced
the
dirty
innyard
the
middle
which
soldiers
were
watering
their
lean
horses
the
pump
while
carts
were
passing
out
the
gate
pierre
turned
away
with
repugnance
and
closing
his
eyes
quickly
fell
back
the
carriage
seat
don
want
that
don
want
see
and
understand
that
want
understand
what
was
revealing
itself
dream
one
second
more
and
should
have
understood
all
but
what
harness
but
how
can
harness
everything
and
pierre
felt
with
horror
that
the
meaning
all
had
seen
and
thought
the
dream
had
been
destroyed
the
groom
the
coachman
and
the
innkeeper
told
pierre
that
officer
had
come
with
news
that
the
french

already
near
mozhaysk
and
that
our
men

and

very
much
upset
when

suddenly
addressing
pierre
with
smile

that

that

pierre
replied
unconcernedly
but
what
have
you
heard
well
you
know
people
often
invent
things
only
say
what
heard
but
what
did
you
hear
well
they
say
continued
the
adjutant
with
the
same
smile
that
the
countess
your
wife
preparing
abroad
expect
nonsense
possibly
remarked
pierre
looking
about
him
absent
mindedly
and
who
that
asked
indicating
short
old
man
clean
blue
peasant
overcoat
with
big
snow
white
beard
and
eyebrows
and
ruddy
face
that
tradesman
that
say
the
restaurant
keeper
vereshchagin
perhaps
you
have
heard
that
affair
with
the
proclamation
that
vereshchagin
said
pierre
looking
the
firm
calm
face
the
old
man
and
seeking
any
indication
his
being
traitor
that
not
himself
that
the
father
the
fellow
who
wrote
the
proclamation
said
the
adjutant
the
young
man
prison
and
expect
will
hard
with
him
old
gentleman
wearing
star
and
another
official
german
wearing
cross
round
his
neck
approached
the
speaker
complicated
story
you
know
said
the
adjutant
that
proclamation
appeared
about
two
months
ago
the
count
was
informed
gave
orders
investigate
the
matter
gabriel
ivanovich
here
made
the
inquiries
the
proclamation
had
passed
through
exactly
sixty
three
hands
asked
one
from
whom
did
you
get
from
and
went
the
next
one
from
whom
did
you
get
and
till
reached
vereshchagin
half
educated
tradesman
you
know
pet
trader
said
the
adjutant
smiling
they
asked
him
who
gave
you
and
the
point
that
knew
whom
had
from
could
only
have
had
from
the
postmaster
but
evidently
they
had
come
some
understanding
replied
from
one
made
myself
they
threatened
and
questioned
him
but
stuck
that
made
myself
and
was
reported
the
count
who
sent
for
the
man
from
whom
did
you
get
the
proclamation
wrote
myself
well
you
know
the
count
said
the
adjutant
cheerfully
with
smile
pride
flared
dreadfully
and
just
think
the
fellow
audacity
lying
and
obstinacy
and
the
count
wanted
him
say
was
from
klyucharev
understand
said
pierre
not
all
rejoined
the
adjutant
dismay
klyucharev
had
his
own
sins
answer
for
without
that
and
that
why
has
been
banished
but
the
point
that
the
count
was
much
annoyed
how
could
you
have
written
yourself
said
and
took
the
hamburg
gazette
that
was
lying
the
table
here
you
did
not
write
yourself
but
translated
and
translated
abominably
because
you
don
even
know
french
you
fool
and
what
you
think
said
have
not
read
any
papers
made
myself
that
you
traitor
and
have
you
tried
and
you
hanged
say
from
whom
you
had
have
seen
papers
made
myself
and
that
was
the
end
the
count
had
the
father
fetched
but
the
fellow
stuck
was
sent
for
trial
and
condemned
hard
labor
believe
now
the
father
has
come
intercede
for
him
but
good
for
nothing
lad
you
know
that
sort
tradesman
son
dandy
and
lady
killer
attended
some
lectures
somewhere
and
imagines
that
the
devil

him
that
the
sort
fellow
his
father
keeps

stone
bridge
and
you
know
there
was
large

reasons
for
this
and
that

now

where
that
regiment
was
forming
the
countess
was
seized
with
terror
the
thought
that
both
her
sons
were
the
war
had
both
gone
from
under
her
wing
that
today
tomorrow
either
both
them
might

struck
her
that
summer
for
the

with
cruel
clearness
she
tried

wished
herself
join
petya
get
him
appointment
somewhere

neither
these
proved
possible
petya
could

transferred
from
obolenski
regiment
bezukhov
which
was
training
near
moscow
though
petya
would
remain

this
transfer
would
give
the
countess
the
consolation
seeing

one
her
sons
under
her
wing
and
she
hoped
arrange
matters
for
her
petya
not
let
him
again
but
always
get
him
appointed
places
where
could
not
possibly
take
part
battle
long
nicholas
alone
was
danger
the
countess
imagined
that
she
loved
her
first
born
more
than
all
her
other
children
and
even
reproached
herself
for
but
when
her
youngest
the
scapegrace
who
had
been
bad
lessons
was
always
breaking
things
the
house
and
making
himself
nuisance
everybody
that
snub
nosed
petya
with
his
merry
black
eyes
and
fresh
rosy
cheeks
where
soft
down
was
just
beginning
show
when
was
thrown
amid
those
big
dreadful
cruel
men
who
were
fighting
somewhere
about
something
and
apparently
finding
pleasure
then
his
mother
thought
she
loved
him
more
much
more
than
all
her
other
children
the
nearer
the
time
came
for
petya
return
the
more
uneasy
grew
the
countess
she
began
think
she
would
never
live
see
such
happiness
the
presence
sonya
her
beloved
natasha
even
her
husband
irritated
her
what
want
with
them
want
one
but
petya
she
thought
the
end
august
the
rostovs
received
another
letter
from
nicholas
wrote
from
the
province
voronezh
where
had
been
sent
procure
remounts
but
that
letter
did
not
set
the
countess
ease
knowing
that
one
son
was
out
danger
she
became
the
more
anxious
about
petya
though
the
twentieth
august
nearly
all
the
rostovs
acquaintances
had
left
moscow
and
though
everybody
tried
persuade
the
countess
get
away
quickly
possible
she
would
not
hear
leaving
before
her
treasure
her
adored
petya
returned
the
twenty
eighth
august
arrived
the
passionate
tenderness
with
which
his
mother
received
him
did
not
please
the
sixteen
year
old
officer
though
she
concealed
from
him
her
intention
keeping
him
under
her
wing
petya
guessed
her
designs
and
instinctively
fearing
that
might
give
way
emotion
when
with
her
might
become
womanish
termed
himself
treated
her
coldly
avoided
her
and
during
his
stay
moscow
attached
himself
exclusively
natasha
for
whom
had
always
had
particularly
brotherly
tenderness
almost
lover
like
owing
the
count
customary
carelessness
nothing
was
ready
for
their
departure
the
twenty
eighth
august
and
the
carts
that
were
come
from
their
ryazan
and
moscow
estates
remove
their
household
belongings
did
not
arrive
till
the
thirtieth
from
the
twenty
eighth
till
the
thirty
first
all
moscow
was
bustle
and
commotion
every
day
thousands
men
wounded
borodino
were
brought
the
dorogomilov
gate
and
taken
various
parts
moscow
and
thousands
carts
conveyed
the
inhabitants
and
their
possessions
out
the
other
gates
spite
rostopchin
broadsheets
because
them
independently
them
the
strangest
and
most
contradictory
rumors
were
current
the
town
some
said
that
one
was
allowed
leave
the
city
others
the
contrary
said
that
all
the
icons
had
been
taken
out
the
churches
and
everybody
was
ordered
leave
some
said
there
had
been
another
battle
after
borodino
which
the
french
had
been
routed
while
others
the
contrary
reported
that
the
russian
army
had
been
destroyed
some
talked
about
the
moscow
militia
which
preceded
the
clergy
would
the
three
hills
others
whispered
that
augustin
had
been
forbidden
leave
that
traitors
had
been
seized
that
the
peasants
were
rioting
and
robbing
people
their
way
from
moscow
and
but
all
this
was
only
talk
reality
though
the
council
fili
which
was
decided
abandon
moscow
had
not
yet
been
held
both
those
who
went
away
and
those
who
remained
behind
felt
though
they
did
not
show
that
moscow
would
certainly
abandoned
and
that
they
ought
get
away
quickly
possible
and
save
their
belongings
was
felt
that
everything
would
suddenly
break
and
change
but
the
first
september
nothing
had
done
criminal
who
being
led
execution
knows
that
must
die
immediately
but
yet
looks
about
him
and
straightens
the
cap
that
awry
his
head
moscow
involuntarily
continued
its
wonted
life
though
knew
that
the
time
its
destruction
was
near
when
the
conditions
life
which
its
people
were
accustomed
submit
would
completely
upset
during
the
three
days
preceding
the
occupation
moscow
the
whole
rostov
family
was
absorbed
various
activities
the
head
the
family
count
ilya
rostov
continually
drove
about
the
city
collecting
the
current
rumors
from
all
sides
and
gave
superficial
and
hasty
orders
home
about
the
preparations
for
their
departure
the
countess
watched
the
things
being
packed
was
dissatisfied
with
everything
was
constantly
pursuit
petya
who
was
always
running
away
from
her
and
was
jealous
natasha
with
whom
spent
all
his
time
sonya
alone
directed
the
practical
side
matters
getting
things
packed
but
late
sonya
had
been
particularly
sad
and
silent
nicholas
letter
which
mentioned
princess
mary
had
elicited
her
presence
joyous
comments
from
the
countess
who
saw
intervention
providence
this
meeting
the
princess
and
nicholas
was
never
pleased
bolkonski
engagement
natasha
said
the
countess
but
always
wanted
nicholas
marry
the
princess
and
had
presentiment
that
would
happen
what
good
thing
would
sonya
felt
that
this
was
true
that
the
only
possibility
retrieving
the
rostovs
affairs
was
nicholas
marrying
rich
woman
and
that
the
princess
was
good
match
was
very
bitter
for
her
but
despite
her
grief
perhaps
just
because
she
took
herself
all
the
difficult
work
directing
the
storing
and
packing
their
things
and
was
busy
for
whole
days
the
count
and
countess
turned
her
when
they
had
any
orders
give
petya
and
natasha
the
contrary
far
from
helping
their
parents
were
generally
nuisance
and
hindrance
everyone
almost
all
day
long
the
house
resounded
with
their
running
feet
their
cries
and
their
spontaneous
laughter
they
laughed
and
were
gay
not
because
there
was
any
reason
laugh
but
because
gaiety
and
mirth
were
their
hearts
and
everything
that
happened
was
cause
for
gaiety
and
laughter
them
petya
was
high
spirits
because
having
left
home
boy
had
returned
everybody
told
him
fine
young
man
because
was
home
because
had
left
belaya
tserkov
where
there
was
hope
soon
taking
part
battle
and
had
come
moscow
where
there
was
fighting
few
days
and
chiefly
because
natasha
whose
lead
always
followed
was
high
spirits
natasha
was
gay
because
she
had
been
sad
too
long
and
now
nothing
reminded
her
the
cause
her
sadness
and
because
she
was
feeling
well
she
was
also
happy
because
she
had
someone
adore
her
the
adoration
others
was
lubricant
the
wheels
her
machine
needed
make
them
run
freely
and
petya
adored
her
above
all
they
were
gay
because
there
was
war
near
moscow
there
would
fighting
the
town
gates
arms
were
being
given
out
everybody
was
escaping
going
away
somewhere
and
general
something
extraordinary
was
happening
and
that
always
exciting
especially
the
young
chapter

saturday
the
thirty
first
august
everything
the
rostovs
house
seemed
topsy
turvy
all
the
doors
were
open
all
the
furniture
was
being
carried
out
moved
about
and
the
mirrors
and
pictures
had
been
taken
down
there
were
trunks
the
rooms
and
hay
wrapping
paper
and
ropes
were
scattered
about
the
peasants
and
house
serfs
carrying
out
the
things
were
treading
heavily
the
parquet
floors
the
yard
was
crowded
with
peasant
carts
some
loaded
high
and
already
corded
others
still
empty
the
voices
and
footsteps
the
many
servants
and
the
peasants
who
had
come
with
the

resounded
they
shouted

and
the

the

had
been
out
since
morning
the
countess
had
headache
brought
all
the
noise
and
turmoil
and
was
lying
down

looking
after
the

and
china
natasha
was
sitting
the
floor
her
dismantled
room
with
dresses
ribbons
and
scarves
strewn
all
about
her
gazing
fixedly
the
floor
and
holding
her
hands
the
old
ball
dress
already
out
fashion
which
she
had
worn
her
first
petersburg
ball
natasha
was
ashamed
doing
nothing
when
everyone
else
was
busy
and
several
times
that
morning
had
tried
set
work
but
her
heart
was
not
and
she
could
not
and
did
not
know
how
anything
except
with
all
her
heart
and
all
her
might
for
while
she
had
stood
beside
sonya
while
the
china
was
being
packed
and
tried
help
but
soon
gave
and
went
her
room
pack
her
own
things
first
she
found
amusing
give
away
dresses
and
ribbons
the
maids
but
when
that
was
done
and
what
was
left
had
still
packed
she
found
dull
dunyasha
you

you

and
when
dunyasha
willingly
promised
all
for
her
natasha
sat
down
the
floor
took
her
old
ball
dress
and
fell
into
reverie
quite
unrelated
what
ought
have
occupied
her
thoughts
now
she
was
roused
from
her
reverie
the
talk
the
maids
the
next
room
which
was
theirs
and
the
sound
their
hurried
footsteps
going

natasha
got
and
looked
out

carts
full
wounded

had
stopped

the
housekeeper
the
old
nurse
the
cooks
coachmen
maids
footmen
postilions
and
scullions
stood
the

staring
the

natasha
throwing

over
her
hair
and
holding
end
each
hand
went
out
into
the

the

with

and
was
speaking
pale
young
officer
who
lay
inside
natasha
moved
few
steps
forward
and
stopped
shyly
still
holding
her
handkerchief
and
listened
what
the
housekeeper
was
saying
then

along
the

with
frightened
eyes

face

once
went

asked
the
major
raised
his
hand
his
cap
with
smile
which
one

selle
said
screwing
his
eyes
and
smiling
natasha
quietly
repeated
her
question
and
her
face
and
whole
manner
were
serious
though
she
was
still
holding
the
ends
her
handkerchief
that
the
major
ceased
smiling
and
after
some
reflection
considering
how
far
the
thing
was
possible
replied
the
affirmative
yes
why
not
they
may
said
with
slight
inclination
her

laughed
and
the

having
kissed
her

natasha
got
and
went

met

realized
that

about
his
not
going
the
battle

knew

the
thought
the
impending
engagement
would
say
something
about

and
the
fatherland
something
senseless
masculine
and
obstinate
which
there
would
contradicting

chapter

madame

the

set

and
preparing
for

departure
the
old
count
suddenly
setting
work
kept
passing
from

shouting
and
disputing

with
the
ardor
characteristic

she
did

her
intervention
the
business
packing
was
received
skeptically
everybody
expected
some
prank
from
her
and
did
not
wish
obey
her
but
she
resolutely
and
passionately
demanded
obedience
grew
angry
and
nearly
cried
because
they
did
not
heed
her
and
last
succeeded
making
them
believe
her
her
first
exploit
which
cost
her
immense
effort
and
established
her
authority
was
the

almost

but
natasha
would
not
give
she
turned
everything
out
and
began
quickly
repacking
deciding
that
the
inferior
russian
carpets
and
unnecessary
crockery
should
not
taken
all
when
everything
had
been
taken
out
the
cases
they
recommenced

tears
fell
from
her
eyes
but
this
only
lasted
moment
she
once
set

afresh
and
they
now
trusted
her
completely
the

not
angry
even
when
they
told
him
that
natasha

moscow
last
day
had
come
was
clear
bright
autumn
day
sunday
the
church
bells
everywhere
were
ringing
for
service
just
usual
sundays
nobody
seemed
yet
realize
what
awaited
the
city
only
two
things
indicated
the
social
condition
moscow
the
rabble
that
the
poor
people
and
the
price
commodities
enormous
crowd
factory
hands
house
serfs
and
peasants
with
whom
some
officials
seminarists
and
gentry
were
mingled
had
gone
early
that
morning
the
three
hills
having
waited
there
for
rostopchin
who
did
not
turn
they
became
convinced
that
moscow
would
surrendered
and
then
dispersed
all
about
the
town
the
public
houses
and
cookshops
prices
too
that
day
indicated
the
state
affairs
the
price
weapons
gold
carts
and
horses
kept
rising
but
the
value
paper
money
and
city
articles
kept
falling
that
midday
there
were
instances
carters
removing
valuable
goods
such
cloth
and
receiving
payment
half
what
they
carted
while
peasant
horses
were
fetching
five
hundred
rubles
each
and
furniture
mirrors
and
bronzes
were
being
given
away
for
nothing
the
rostovs
staid
old
fashioned
house
the
dissolution
former
conditions
life
was
but
little
noticeable
the
serfs
the
only
indication
was
that
three
out
their
huge
retinue
disappeared
during
the
night
but
nothing
was
stolen
and
the
value
their
possessions
the
thirty
peasant
carts
that
had
come
from
their
estates
and
which
many
people
envied
proved
extremely
valuable
and
they
were
offered
enormous
sums
money
for
them
not
only
were
huge
sums
offered
for
the
horses
and
carts

went
round

pushed
them
away
and
resting
his
head
his
hand
sank
into
meditation
gerasim
looked
cautiously
into
the
study
several
times
and
saw
pierre
always
sitting
the
same
attitude
more
than
two
hours
passed
and
gerasim
took
the
liberty
making
slight
noise
the
door
attract
his
attention

not
hear

talking
himself
and
spent

and

the

during
the

they
marched
slowly
and
steadily
without

daybreak
however
those
nearing
the
town
the
dorogomilov
bridge
saw
ahead
them
masses
soldiers
crowding
and
hurrying
across
the
bridge
ascending
the
opposite
side
and
blocking
the
streets
and
alleys
while
endless
masses
troops
were
bearing
down
them
from

and
unreasoning
hurry
and
alarm
overcame
them
they
all
rushed
forward

they
had
ample

the

was
the

side
moscow
beyond
that
very
time
ten
the
morning
the
second
september
napoleon
was
standing
among
his
troops
the
poklonny
hill
looking
the
panorama
spread
out
before
him
from
the
twenty
sixth
august
the
second
september
that
from
the
battle
borodino
the
entry
the
french
into
moscow
during
the
whole
that
agitating
memorable
week
there
had
been
the
extraordinary
autumn
weather
that
always
comes
surprise
when
the
sun
hangs
low
and
gives
more
heat
than
spring
when
everything
shines
brightly
the
rare
clear
atmosphere
that
the
eyes
smart
when
the
lungs
are
strengthened
and
refreshed
inhaling
the
aromatic
autumn
air
when
even
the
nights
are
warm
and
when
those
dark
warm
nights
golden
stars
startle
and
delight
continually
falling
from
the
sky
ten
the
morning
the
second
september
this
weather
still
held
the
brightness
the
morning
was
magical
moscow
seen
from
the
poklonny
hill
lay
spaciously
spread
out
with
her
river
her
gardens
and
her
churches
and
she
seemed
living
her
usual
life
her
cupolas
glittering
like
stars
the
sunlight
the
view
the
strange
city
with
its
peculiar
architecture
such
had
never
seen
before
filled
napoleon
with
the
rather
envious
and
uneasy
curiosity
men
feel
when
they
see
alien
form
life
that
has
knowledge
them
this
city
was
evidently
living
with
the
full
force
its
own
life
the
indefinite
signs
which
even
distance
distinguish
living
body
from
dead
one
napoleon
from
the
poklonny
hill
perceived
the
throb
life
the
town
and
felt
were
the
breathing
that
great
and
beautiful
body
every
russian
looking
moscow
feels
her
mother
every
foreigner
who
sees
her
even
ignorant
her
significance
the
mother
city
must
feel
her
feminine
character
and
napoleon
felt
cette

done
enfin
cette
fameuse
ville

inscribe
great

just
this
which
alexander

standing
the

the

awaiting
the

his
speech
the
boyars
had
already
taken
definite
shape
his
imagination
that

was
full

greatness
napoleon
understood
was

really
moscow

why
the

from

long
appearing
wondered
dear
tender
poor

house
mother
meanwhile
agitated
consultation
was
being
carried
whispers
among
his
generals
and
marshals
the
rear
his
suite
those
sent
fetch
the
deputation
had
returned
with
the
news
that
moscow
was
empty
that
everyone
had
left
the
faces
those
who
were
not
conferring
together
were
pale
and
perturbed
they
were
not
alarmed
the
fact
that
moscow
had
been
abandoned
its
inhabitants
grave
that
fact
seemed
but
the
question
how
tell
the
emperor
without
putting
him
the
terrible
position
appearing
ridiculous
that
had
been
awaiting
the
boyars
long
vain
that
there
were
drunken
mobs
left
moscow
but
one
else
some
said
that
deputation
some
sort
must
scraped
together
others
disputed
that
opinion
and
maintained
that
the
emperor
should
first
carefully
and
skillfully
prepared
and
then
told
the
truth
will
have
told
all
the
same
said
some
gentlemen
the
suite
but
gentlemen
the
position
was
the
more
awkward
because
the
emperor
meditating
upon
his
magnanimous
plans
was
pacing
patiently
and
down
before
the
outspread
map
occasionally
glancing
along
the
road
moscow
from
under
his
lifted
hand
with
bright
and
proud
smile
but
impossible

the
gentlemen

shrugging
their
shoulders
but
not
venturing
utter
the
implied
word

beyond
moscow
this
was
not
news
rostopchin
had
known
that
moscow
would
abandoned
not
merely
since
his
interview
the
previous
day
with
kutuzov
the
poklonny
hill
but
ever
since
the
battle
borodino
for
all
the
generals
who
came
moscow
after
that
battle
had
said
unanimously
that
was
impossible
fight
another
battle
and
since
then
the
government
property
had
been
removed
every
night
and
half
the
inhabitants
had
left
the
city
with
rostopchin
own
permission
yet
all
the
same
this
information
astonished
and
irritated
the
count
coming
did
the
form
simple
note
with
order
from
kutuzov
and
received
night
breaking
his
beauty
sleep
when
later
his
memoirs
count
rostopchin
explained
his
actions
this
time
repeatedly
says
that
was
then
actuated
two
important
considerations
maintain
tranquillity
moscow
and
expedite
the
departure
the
inhabitants
one
accepts
this
twofold
aim
all
rostopchin
actions
appear
irreproachable
why
were
the
holy
relics
the
arms
ammunition
gunpowder
and
stores
corn
not
removed
why
were
thousands
inhabitants
deceived
into
believing
that
moscow
would
not
given
and
thereby
ruined
preserve
the
tranquillity
the
city
explains
count
rostopchin
why
were
bundles
useless
papers
from
the
government
offices
and
leppich
balloon
and
other
articles
removed
leave
the
town
empty
explains
count
rostopchin
one
need
only
admit
that
public
tranquillity
danger
and
any
action
finds
justification
all
the
horrors
the
reign
terror
were
based
only
solicitude
for
public
tranquillity
what
then
was
count
rostopchin
fear
for
the
tranquillity
moscow
based
what
reason
was
there
for
assuming
any
probability
uprising
the
city
the
inhabitants
were
leaving
and
the
retreating
troops
were
filling
why
should
that
cause
the
masses
riot
neither
moscow
nor
anywhere
russia
did
anything
resembling
insurrection
ever
occur
when
the
enemy
entered
town
more
than
ten
thousand
people
were
still
moscow
the
first
and
second
september
and
except
for
mob
the
governor
courtyard
assembled
there
his
bidding
nothing
happened
obvious
that
there
would
have
been
even
less
reason
expect
disturbance
among
the
people
after
the
battle
borodino
when
the
surrender
moscow
became
certain
least
probable
rostopchin
instead
exciting
the
people
distributing
arms
and
broadsheets
had
taken
steps
remove
all
the
holy
relics
the
gunpowder
munitions
and
money
and
had
told
the
population
plainly
that
the
town
would
abandoned
rostopchin
though
had
patriotic
sentiments
was
sanguine
and
impulsive
man
who
had
always
moved
the
highest
administrative
circles
and
had
understanding
all
the
people
supposed
himself
guiding
ever
since
the
enemy
entry
into
smolensk
had
imagination
been
playing
the
role
director
the
popular
feeling
the
heart
russia
not
only
did
seem
him
all
administrators
that
controlled
the
external
actions
moscow
inhabitants
but
also
thought
controlled
their
mental
attitude
means
his
broadsheets
and
posters
written
coarse
tone
which
the
people
despise
their
own
class
and
not
understand
from
those
authority
rostopchin
was
pleased
with
the
fine
role
leader
popular
feeling
and
had
grown
used
that
the
necessity
relinquishing
that
role
and
abandoning
moscow
without
any
heroic
display
took
him
unawares
and
suddenly
felt
the
ground
slip
away
from
under
his
feet
that
positively
did
not
know
what
though
knew
was
coming
did
not
till
the
last
moment
wholeheartedly
believe
that
moscow
would
abandoned
and
did
not
prepare
for
the
inhabitants
left
against
his
wishes
the
government
offices
were
removed
this
was
only
done
the
demand
officials
whom
the
count
yielded
reluctantly
was
absorbed
the
role
had
created
for
himself
often
the
case
with
those
gifted
with
ardent
imagination
though
had
long
known
that
moscow
would
abandoned
knew
only
with
his
intellect
did
not
believe
his
heart
and
did
not
adapt
himself
mentally
this
new
position
affairs
all
his
painstaking
and
energetic
activity
how
far
was
useful
and
had
any
effect
the
people
another
question
had
been
simply
directed
toward
arousing
the
masses
his
own
feeling
patriotic
hatred
the
french
but
when
events
assumed
their
true
historical
character
when
expressing
hatred
for
the
french
words
proved
insufficient
when
was
not
even
possible
express
that
hatred
fighting
battle
when
self
confidence
was
avail
relation
the
one
question
before
moscow
when
the
whole
population
streamed
out
moscow
one
man
abandoning
their
belongings
and
proving
that
negative
action
all
the
depth
their
national
feeling
then
the
role
chosen
rostopchin
suddenly
appeared
senseless
unexpectedly
felt
himself
ridiculous
weak
and
alone
with
ground
stand
when
awakened
from
his
sleep
received
that
cold
peremptory
note
from
kutuzov
felt
the
more
irritated
the
more
felt
himself
blame
all
that
had
been
specially
put
charge
the
state
property
which
should
have
removed
was
still
moscow
and
was
longer
possible
take
the
whole
away
who
blame
for
who
has
let
things
come
such
pass
ruminated
not
course
had
everything
ready
had
moscow
firmly
hand
and
this
what
they
have
let
come
villains
traitors
thought
without
clearly
defining
who
the
villains
and
traitors
were
but
feeling
necessary
hate
those
traitors
whoever
they
might
who
were
blame
for
the
false
and
ridiculous
position
which
found
himself
all
that
night

rostopchin
issued

and
angry

indicating
that

toward
nine
clock
the
morning
when
the
troops
were
already
moving
through
moscow
nobody
came
the
count
any
more
for
instructions
those
who
were
able
get
away
were
going
their
own
accord
those
who
remained
behind
decided
for
themselves
what
they
must
the
count
ordered
his
carriage
that
might
drive
sokolniki
and
sat
his
study
with
folded
hands
morose
sallow
and
taciturn
quiet
and
untroubled
times
seems
every
administrator
that
only
his
efforts
that
the
whole
population
under
his
rule
kept
going
and
this
consciousness
being
indispensable
every
administrator
finds
the
chief
reward
his
labor
and
efforts
while
the
sea
history
remains
calm
the
ruler
administrator
his
frail
bark
holding
with
boat
hook
the
ship
the
people
and
himself
moving
naturally
imagines
that
his
efforts
move
the
ship
holding
but
soon
storm
arises
and
the
sea
begins
heave
and
the
ship
move
such
delusion
longer
possible
the
ship
moves
independently
with
its
own
enormous
motion
the
boat
hook
longer
reaches
the
moving
vessel
and
suddenly
the
administrator
instead
appearing
ruler
and
source
power
becomes
insignificant
useless
feeble
man
rostopchin
felt
this
and
was
this
which
exasperated
him
the
superintendent
police
whom
the
crowd
had
stopped
went
see
him
the
same
time
adjutant
who
informed
the
count
that
the
horses
were
harnessed
they
were
both
pale
and
the
superintendent
police
after
reporting
that
had
executed
the
instructions
had
received
informed
the
count
that
immense
crowd
had
collected
the
courtyard
and
wished
see
him
without
saying
word
rostopchin
rose
and
walked
hastily

light
luxurious
drawing
room
went

balcony

took
hold
the
handle
let
again
and
went
the
window
from
which
had
better
view
the
whole

the
tall
lad
was
standing

flourishing
his
arm
and
saying
something
with
stern

beside
him
with
gloomy

audible
through
the

replied
the
adjutant
rostopchin
went
again

but
what
they

asked
the
superintendent

your
excellency
they
say

have
got
ready
according
your
orders
against

this
what
they
have

within
him
against
the
someone

have
roused
their
folly

looked
the
tall
lad
flourishing

and
this
thought
occurred
him
just
because

his
rage

the

struck
unexpected
recollection
and
rapidly
opening
the
door
went
resolutely
out
onto
the
balcony
the
talking
instantly
ceased
hats
and
caps
were
doffed
and
all
eyes
were
raised
the
count
good

said
the
count
briskly
and
loudly
thank

with
the
villain

the
count
stepped
briskly
back
into
the
room
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
murmur
approbation
and
satisfaction
ran
through
the
crowd

with
all
the
villains

and
you
said
the
french
show
you
what
law
the
mob
were
saying
reproving
one
another
for
their
lack
confidence
few
minutes
later
officer
came
hurriedly
out
the
front
door
gave
order
and
the
dragoons
formed
line
the
crowd
moved
eagerly
from
the
balcony
toward
the
porch
rostopchin
coming
out
there
with
quick
angry
steps
looked
hastily
around
seeking
someone
where
inquired
and
spoke
saw
young
man
coming
round
the
corner
the
house
between
two
dragoons
had
long
thin
neck
and
his
head
that
had
been
half
shaved
was
again
covered
short
hair
this
young
man
was
dressed
threadbare
blue
cloth

lined
with
fox
fur
that
had
once
been
smart
and
dirty
hempen
convict
trousers
over
which
were
pulled
his
thin
dirty
trodden
down
boots
his
thin
weak
legs
were
heavy
chains
which
hampered
his
irresolute
movements
said
rostopchin
hurriedly
turning
away
his
eyes
from
the
young
man
the
fur
lined
coat
and
pointing
the
bottom
step
the
porch
put
him
there
the
young
man
his
clattering
chains
stepped
clumsily
the
spot
indicated
holding
away
with
one
finger
the
coat
collar
which
chafed
his
neck
turned
his
long
neck
twice
this
way
and
that
sighed
and
submissively
folded
before
him
his
thin
hands
unused
work
for
several
seconds
while
the
young
man
was
taking
his
place
the
step
the
silence
continued
only
among
the
back
rows
the
people
who
were
all
pressing
toward
the
one
spot
could
sighs
groans
and
the
shuffling
feet
heard
while
waiting
for
the
young
man
take
his
place
the
step
rostopchin
stood
frowning
and
rubbing
his
face
with
his
hand
lads
said
with
metallic
ring
his
voice
this
man
vereshchagin
the
scoundrel
whose
doing

perishing
the
young
man
the
fur
lined

stooping
little
stood

his
fingers
clasped
before
him
his
emaciated
young
face
disfigured
the
half
shaven
head
hung
down
hopelessly
the
count
first
words
raised
slowly
and
looked
him
wishing
say
something
least
meet
his
eye
but
rostopchin
did
not
look
him
vein
the
young
man
long
thin
neck
swelled
like
cord
and
went
blue
behind
the
ear
and
suddenly
his
face
flushed
all
eyes
were
fixed
him
looked
the
crowd
and
rendered
more
hopeful
the
expression
read
the
faces
there
smiled
sadly
and
timidly
and
lowering
his
head
shifted
his
feet
the
step
has
betrayed
his
tsar
and
his
country
has
gone
over
bonaparte
alone
all
the
russians
has
disgraced
the
russian
name
has
caused
moscow
perish
said
rostopchin
sharp
even
voice
but
suddenly
glanced
down
vereshchagin
who
continued
stand
the
same
submissive
attitude
inflamed
the
sight
raised
his
arm
and
addressed
the
people
almost
shouting
deal
with
him
you
think
fit
hand
him
over
you
the
crowd
remained
silent
and
only
pressed
closer
and
closer
one
another
keep
one
another
back
breathe
that
stifling
atmosphere
unable
stir
and
await
something
unknown
uncomprehended
and
terrible
was
becoming
unbearable
those
standing
front
who
had
seen
and
heard
what
had
taken
place
before
them
all
stood
with
wide
open
eyes
and
mouths
straining
with
all
their
strength
and
held
back
the
crowd
that
was
pushing
behind
them
beat
him
let
the
traitor
perish
and
not
disgrace
the
russian
name
shouted
rostopchin
cut
him
down
command
hearing
not
much
the
words
the
angry
tone
rostopchin
voice
the
crowd
moaned
and
heaved
forward
but
again
paused
count
exclaimed
the
timid
yet
theatrical
voice
vereshchagin
the
midst
the
momentary
silence
that
ensued
count
one
god
above
both
lifted
his
head
and
again
the
thick
vein
his
thin
neck
filled
with
blood
and
the
color
rapidly
came
and
went
his
face
did
not
finish
what
wished
say
cut
him
down
command
shouted
rostopchin
suddenly
growing
pale
like
vereshchagin
draw
sabers
cried
the
dragoon
officer
drawing
his
own
another
still
stronger
wave
flowed
through
the
crowd
and
reaching
the
front
ranks
carried
swaying
the
very
steps
the
porch
the
tall
youth
with
stony
look
his
face
and
rigid
and
uplifted
arm
stood
beside
vereshchagin
saber
him
the
dragoon
officer
almost
whispered
and
one
the
soldiers
his
face
all
once
distorted
with
fury
struck
vereshchagin
the
head
with
the
blunt
side
his
saber
cried
vereshchagin
meek
surprise
looking
round
with
frightened
glance
not
understanding
why
this
was
done
him
similar
moan
surprise
and
horror
ran
through
the
crowd
lord
exclaimed
sorrowful
voice
but
after
the
exclamation
surprise
that
had
escaped
from
vereshchagin
uttered
plaintive
cry
pain
and
that
cry
was
fatal
the
barrier
human
feeling
strained
the
utmost
that
had
held
the
crowd
check
suddenly
broke
the
crime
had
begun
and
must
now
completed
the
plaintive
moan
reproach
was
drowned
the
threatening
and
angry
roar
the
crowd
like
the
seventh
and
last
wave
that
shatters
ship
that
last
irresistible
wave
burst
from
the
rear
and
reached
the
front
ranks
carrying
them
off
their
feet
and
engulfing
them
all
the
dragoon
was
about
repeat
his
blow
vereshchagin
with
cry
horror
covering
his
head
with
his
hands
rushed
toward
the
crowd
the
tall
youth
against
whom
stumbled
seized
his
thin
neck
with
his
hands
and
yelling
wildly
fell
with
him
under
the
feet
the
pressing
struggling
crowd
some
beat
and
tore
vereshchagin
others
the
tall
youth
and
the
screams
those
that
were
being
trampled
and
those
who
tried
rescue
the
tall
lad
only
increased
the
fury
the
crowd
was
long
time
before
the
dragoons
could
extricate
the
bleeding
youth
beaten
almost
death
and
for
long
time
despite
the
feverish
haste
with
which
the
mob
tried
end
the
work
that
had
been
begun
those
who
were
hitting
throttling
and
tearing
vereshchagin
were
unable
kill
him
for
the
crowd
pressed
from
all
sides
swaying
one
mass
with
them
the
center
and
rendering
impossible
for
them
either
kill
him

him
hit

when
the

and
his
cries

rattle
did
the
crowd
around
his
prostrate
bleeding
corpse
begin
rapidly
change
places
each
one
came
glanced
what
had
been
done
and
with
horror
reproach
and
astonishment
pushed
back
again
lord
the
people
are
like
wild
beasts
how
could

the
crowd
could
heard
saying
quite
young

they

and
there
another
has
been
beaten
too
they
say
nearly
done
for
the
people
aren
they
afraid
sinning
said
the
same
mob
now
looking
with
pained
distress
the
dead
body
with
its
long
thin
half
severed
neck
and
its
livid
face
stained
with
blood
and
dust
painstaking
police
officer
considering
the
presence
corpse
his
excellency
courtyard
unseemly
told
the
dragoons
take
away
two
dragoons
took
its
distorted
legs
and
dragged
along
the
ground
the
gory
dust
stained
half
shaven
head
with
its
long
neck
trailed
twisting
along
the
ground
the
crowd
shrank
back
from
the
moment
when
vereshchagin
fell
and
the
crowd
closed
with
savage
yells
and
swayed
about
him
rostopchin
suddenly
turned
pale
and
instead
going
the
back
entrance
where
his
carriage
awaited
him
went
with
hurried
steps
and
bent
head
not
knowing
where
and
why
along
the
passage
leading
the
rooms
the
ground
floor
the
count
face
was
white
and
could
not
control
the
feverish
twitching
his
lower
jaw
this
way
your
excellency
where
are
you
going
this
way
please
said
trembling
frightened
voice
behind
him
count
rostopchin
was
unable
reply
and
turning
obediently
went
the
direction
indicated
the
back
entrance
stood
his
caleche
the
distant
roar
the
yelling
crowd
was
audible
even
there
hastily
took
his
seat
and
told
the
coachman
drive
him
his
country
house
sokolniki
when
they
reached
the
myasnitski
street
and
could
longer
hear
the
shouts
the
mob
the
count
began
repent
remembered
with
dissatisfaction
the
agitation
and
fear
had
betrayed
before
his
subordinates
the
mob
terrible
disgusting
said
himself
french
they
are
like
wolves
whom
nothing
but
flesh
can
appease
count
one
god
above
both
vereshchagin
words
suddenly
recurred
him
and
disagreeable
shiver
ran
down
his
back
but
this
was
only
momentary
feeling
and
count
rostopchin
smiled
disdainfully
himself
had
other
duties
thought
the
people
had
appeased
many
other
victims
have
perished
and
are
perishing
for
the
public
good
and
began
thinking
his
social
duties
his
family
and
the
city
entrusted
him
and
himself
not
himself
theodore
vasilyevich
rostopchin
fancied
that
theodore
vasilyevich
rostopchin
was
sacrificing
himself
for
the
public
good
but
himself
governor
the
representative
authority
and
the
tsar
had
been
simply
theodore
vasilyevich
course
action
would
have
been
quite
different
but
was
duty
safeguard
life
and
dignity
commander
chief
lightly
swaying
the
flexible
springs
his
carriage
and
longer
hearing
the
terrible
sounds
the
crowd
rostopchin
grew
physically
calm
and
always
happens
soon
became
physically
tranquil
his
mind
devised
reasons
why
should
mentally
tranquil
too
the
thought
which
tranquillized
rostopchin
was
not
new
one
since
the
world
began
and
men
have
killed
one
another
one
has
ever
committed
such
crime
against
his
fellow
man
without
comforting
himself
with
this
same
idea
this
idea
bien
public
the
hypothetical
welfare
other
people
man
not
swayed
passion
that
welfare
never
certain
but
who
commits
such
crime
always
knows
just
where
that
welfare
lies
and
rostopchin
now
knew
not
only
did
his
reason
not
reproach
him
for
what
had
done
but
even
found
cause
for
self
satisfaction
having
successfully
contrived
avail
himself
convenient
opportunity
punish
criminal
and
the
same
time
pacify
the
mob
vereshchagin
was
tried
and
condemned
death
thought
rostopchin
though
the
senate
had
only
condemned
vereshchagin
hard
labor
was
traitor
and
spy
could
not
let
him
unpunished
and
have
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
appease
the
mob
gave
them
victim
and
the
same
time
punished
miscreant
having
reached
his
country
house
and
begun
give
orders
about
domestic
arrangements
the
count
grew
quite
tranquil
half
hour
later
was
driving
with
his
fast
horses
across
the
sokolniki
field
longer
thinking
what
had
occurred
but
considering
what
was
come
was
driving
the
yauza
bridge
where
had
heard
that
kutuzov
was
count
rostopchin
was
mentally
preparing
the
angry
and
stinging
reproaches
meant
address
kutuzov
for
his
deception
would
make
that
foxy
old
courtier
feel
that
the
responsibility
for
all
the
calamities
that
would
follow
the
abandonment
the
city
and
the
ruin
russia
rostopchin
regarded
would
fall
upon
his
doting
old
head
planning
beforehand
what
would
say
kutuzov
rostopchin
turned
angrily
his
caleche
and
gazed
sternly
from
side
side
the
sokolniki
field
was
deserted
only
the
end
front
the
almshouse
and
the
lunatic
asylum
could
seen
some
people
white
and
others
like
them
walking
singly
across
the
field
shouting
and
gesticulating
one
these
was
running
cross
the
path
count
rostopchin
carriage
and
the
count
himself
his
coachman
and
his
dragoons
looked
with
vague
horror
and
curiosity
these
released
lunatics
and
especially
the
one
running
toward
them
swaying
from
side
side
his
long
thin
legs
his
fluttering
dressing
gown
this
lunatic
was
running
impetuously
his
gaze
fixed
rostopchin
shouting
something
hoarse
voice
and
making
signs
him
stop
the
lunatic
solemn
gloomy
face
was
thin
and
yellow
with
its
beard
growing
uneven
tufts
his
black
agate
pupils
with
saffron
yellow
whites
moved
restlessly
near
the
lower
eyelids
stop
pull
tell
you
cried
piercing
voice
and
again
shouted
something
breathlessly
with
emphatic
intonations
and
gestures
coming
abreast
the
caleche
ran
beside
thrice
have
they
slain
thrice
have
risen
from
the
dead
they
stoned
crucified
shall
rise
shall
rise
shall
rise
they
have
torn
body
the
kingdom
god
will
overthrown
thrice
will
overthrow
and
thrice

cried
raising
his
voice
higher
and
higher
count
rostopchin
suddenly
grew
pale
had
done
when
the
crowd
closed
vereshchagin
turned
away
fas
faster
cried
trembling
voice
his
coachman
the
caleche
flew
over
the
ground
fast
the
horses
could
draw
but
for
long
time
count
rostopchin
still
heard
the
insane
despairing
screams
growing
fainter
the
distance
while
his
eyes
saw
nothing
but
the
astonished
frightened
bloodstained
face
the
traitor
the
fur
lined
coat
recent
that
mental
picture
was
rostopchin
already
felt
that
had
cut
deep
into
his
heart
and
drawn
blood
even
now
felt
clearly
that
the
gory
trace
that
recollection
would
not
pass
with
time
but
that
the
terrible
memory
would
the
contrary
dwell
his
heart
ever
more
cruelly
and
painfully
the
end
his
life
seemed
still
hear
the
sound
his
own
words
cut
him
down
command
why
did
utter
those
words
was
some
accident
said
them
need
not
have
said
them
thought
and
then
nothing
would
have
happened
saw
the
frightened
and
then
infuriated
face
the
dragoon
who
dealt
the
blow
the
look
silent
timid
reproach
that
boy
the
fur
lined
coat
had
turned
upon
him
but
did
not
for
own
sake
was
bound
act
that
way
the
mob
the
traitor
the
public
welfare
thought
troops
were
still
crowding
the
yauza
bridge
was
hot
kutuzov
dejected
and
frowning
sat
bench
the
bridge
toying
with
his
whip
the
sand
when
caleche
dashed
noisily
man
general
uniform
with
plumes
his
hat
went
kutuzov
and
said
something
french
was
count
rostopchin
told
kutuzov
that
had
come
because
moscow
the
capital
was
more
and
only
the
army
remained
things
would
have
been
different
your
serene
highness
had
not
told
that
you
would
not
abandon
moscow
without
another
battle
all
this
would
not
have
happened
said
kutuzov
looked
rostopchin
not
grasping
what
was
said
him
was
trying
read
something
peculiar
written
that
moment
the
face
the
man
addressing
him
rostopchin
grew
confused
and
became
silent
kutuzov
slightly
shook
his
head
and
not
taking
his
penetrating
gaze
from
rostopchin
face
muttered
softly
shall
not
give
moscow
without
battle
whether
kutuzov
was
thinking
something
entirely
different
when
spoke
those
words
uttered
them
purposely
knowing
them
meaningless
any
rate
rostopchin
made
reply
and
hastily
left
him
and
strange
say
the
governor
moscow
the
proud
count
rostopchin
took
cossack
whip
and
went
the
bridge
where
began
with
shouts
drive
the
carts
that
blocked
the
way

those
who
had

they
all
stared
timid
bewilderment
the

rode
the

take
off

these
words
went
from
one
another
the
crowd
the
interpreter
addressed
old
porter
and
asked
was
far
the
kremlin
the
porter
listening
perplexity
the
unfamiliar
polish
accent
and
not
realizing
that
the
interpreter
was
speaking
russian
did
not
understand
what
was
being
said
him
and
slipped
behind
the
others
murat
approached
the
interpreter
and
told
him
ask
where
the
russian
army
was
one
the
russians
understood
what
was
asked
and
several
voices
once
began
answering
the
interpreter
french
officer
returning
from
the
advanced
detachment
rode
murat
and
reported
that
the
gates
the
citadel
had
been
barricaded
and
that
there
was
probably
ambuscade
there
good
said
murat
and
turning
one
the
gentlemen
his
suite
ordered
four
light
guns
moved
forward
fire
the
gates
the
guns
emerged
trot
from
the
column
following
murat
and
advanced
the
arbat
when
they
reached
the
end
the
vozdvizhenka
street
they
halted
and
drew
the
square
several
french
officers
superintended
the
placing
the
guns
and
looked
the
kremlin
through
field
glasses
the
bells
the
kremlin
were
ringing
for
vespers
and
this
sound
troubled
the
french
they
imagined
call
arms
few
infantrymen
ran
the
kutafyev
gate
beams
and
wooden
screens
had
been
put
there
and
two
musket
shots
rang
out
from
under
the
gate
soon
officer
and
men
began
run
toward
general
who
was
standing
the
guns
shouted
some
words
command
the
officer
and
the
latter
ran
back
again
with
his
men
the
sound
three
more
shots
came
from
the
gate
one
shot
struck
french
soldier
foot
and
from
behind
the
screens
came
the
strange
sound
few
voices
shouting
instantly
word
command
the
expression
cheerful
serenity
the
faces
the
french
general
officers
and
men
changed
one
determined
concentrated
readiness
for
strife
and
suffering
all
them
from
the

the
least
soldier
that
place
was
not
the
vozdvizhenka
mokhavaya
kutafyev
street
nor
the
troitsa
gate
places
familiar
moscow
but
new
battlefield
which
would
probably
prove
sanguinary
and
all
made
ready
for
that
battle
the
cries
from
the
gates
ceased
the
guns
were
advanced
the
artillerymen
blew
the
ash
off
their
linstocks
and
officer
gave
the
word
fire
this
was
followed
two
whistling
sounds
canister
shot
one
after
another
the
shot
rattled
against
the
stone
the
gate
and
upon
the
wooden
beams
and
screens
and
two
wavering
clouds
smoke
rose
over
the
square
few
instants
after
the
echo
the
reports
resounding
over
the
stone
built
kremlin
had
died
away
the
french
heard
strange
sound
above
their
head
thousands
crows
rose
above
the
walls
and
circled
the
air
cawing
and
noisily
flapping
their
wings
together
with
that
sound
came
solitary
human
cry
from
the
gateway
and
amid
the
smoke
appeared
the
figure
bareheaded
man
peasant
coat
grasped
musket
and
took
aim
the
french
fire
repeated
the
officer
once
more
and
the
reports
musket
and
two
cannon
shots
were
heard
simultaneously
the
gate
was
again
hidden
smoke
nothing
more
stirred
behind
the
screens
and
the
french
infantry
soldiers
and
officers
advanced
the
gate
the
gateway
lay
three
wounded
and
four
dead
two
men
peasant
coats
ran
away
the
foot
the
wall
toward
the
znamenka
clear
that
away
said
the
officer
pointing
the
beams
and
the
corpses
and
the
french
soldiers
after
dispatching
the
wounded
threw
the
corpses
over
the
parapet
who
these
men
were
nobody
knew
clear
that
away
was
all
that
was
said
them
and
they
were
thrown
over
the
parapet
and
removed
later
that
they
might
not
stink
thiers

dedicates
few
eloquent
lines
their

these
wretches
had
occupied
the
sacred
citadel
having
supplied
themselves
with
guns
from
the
arsenal
and
fired
the
wretches
the
french
some
them
were
sabered
and
the
kremlin
was
purged
their
presence
murat
was
informed
that
the
way
had
been
cleared
the
french
entered
the
gates
and
began
pitching
their
camp
the
senate
square
out
the
windows
the
senate
house
the
soldiers
threw
chairs
into
the
square
for
fuel
and
kindled
fires
there
other
detachments
passed
through
the
kremlin
and
encamped
along
the
moroseyka

quartered
themselves
along

and
the

the

were
not

lived
camp
though
tattered
hungry
worn
out
and
reduced
third
their
original
number
the
french
entered
moscow
good
marching
order
was
weary
and
famished
but
still
fighting
and
menacing
army
but
remained
army
only
until
its
soldiers
had
dispersed
into
their
different
lodgings
soon
the
men
the
various
regiments
began
disperse
among
the
wealthy
and
deserted
houses
the
army
was
lost
forever
and
there
came
into
being
something
nondescript
neither
citizens
nor
soldiers
but
what
are
known
marauders
when
five
weeks
later
these
same
men
left
moscow
they
longer
formed
army
they
were
mob
marauders
each
carrying
quantity
articles
which
seemed
him
valuable
useful
the
aim
each
man
when
left
moscow
was
longer
had
been
conquer
but
merely
keep
what
had
acquired
like
monkey
which
puts
its
paw
into
the
narrow
neck
jug
and
having
seized
handful
nuts
will
not
open
its
fist
for
fear
losing
what
holds
and
therefore
perishes
the
french
when
they
left
moscow
had
inevitably
perish
because
they
carried
their
loot
with
them
yet
abandon
what
they
had
stolen
was
impossible
for
them
for
the
monkey
open
its
paw
and
let
its
nuts
ten
minutes
after
each
regiment
had
entered
moscow
district
not
soldier
officer
was
left
men
military
uniforms
and
hessian
boots
could
seen
through
the
windows
laughing
and
walking
through
the
rooms
cellars
and
storerooms
similar
men
were
busy
among
the
provisions
and
the
yards
unlocking
breaking
open
coach
house
and
stable
doors
lighting
fires
kitchens
and
kneading
and
baking
bread
with
rolled
sleeves
and
cooking
frightening
amusing
caressing
women
and
children
there
were
many
such
men
both
the
shops
and
houses
but
there
was
army
order
after
order
was
issued
the
french
commanders
that
day
forbidding
the
men
disperse
about
the
town
sternly
forbidding
any
violence
the
inhabitants
any
looting
and
announcing
roll
call
for
that
very
evening
but
despite
all
these
measures
the
men
who
had
till
then
constituted
army
flowed
all
over
the
wealthy
deserted
city
with
its
comforts
and
plentiful
supplies
hungry
herd
cattle
keeps
well
together
when
crossing
barren
field
but
gets
out
hand
and
once
disperses
uncontrollably
soon
reaches
rich
pastures
did
the
army
disperse
all
over
the
wealthy
city
residents
were
left
moscow
and
the
soldiers
like
water
percolating
through
sand
spread
irresistibly
through
the
city
all
directions
from
the
kremlin
into
which
they
had
first
marched
the
cavalry
entering
merchant
house
that
had
been
abandoned
and
finding
there
stabling
more
than
sufficient
for
their
horses
went
all
the
same
the
next
house
which
seemed
them
better
many
them
appropriated
several
houses
chalked
their
names
them
and
quarreled
and
even
fought
with
other
companies
for
them
before
they
had
had
time
secure
quarters
the
soldiers
ran
out
into
the
streets
see
the
city
and
hearing
that
everything
had
been
abandoned
rushed
places
where
valuables
were
had
for
the
taking
the
officers
followed
check
the
soldiers
and
were
involuntarily
drawn
into
doing
the
same
carriage
row
carriages
had
been
left
the
shops
and
generals
flocked
there
select
caleches
and
coaches
for
themselves
the
few
inhabitants
who
had
remained
invited

radiating

reached
the
quarter
where
pierre
was
staying
the
evening
the
second
september
after
the
last
two
days
spent
solitude
and
unusual
circumstances
pierre
was
state
bordering
insanity
was
completely
obsessed
one
persistent
thought
did
not
know
how
when
this
thought
had
taken
such
possession
him
but
remembered
nothing
the
past
understood
nothing
the
present
and
all
saw
and
heard
appeared
him
like
dream
had
left
home
only
escape
the
intricate
tangle
life
demands
that
enmeshed
him
and
which
his
present
condition
was
unable
unravel
had
gone
joseph
alexeevich
house
the
plea
sorting
the
deceased
books
and
papers
only
search
rest
from
life
turmoil
for
his
mind
the
memory
joseph
alexeevich
was
connected
with
world
eternal
solemn
and
calm
thoughts
quite
contrary
the
restless
confusion
into
which
felt
himself
being
drawn
sought
quiet
refuge
and
joseph
alexeevich
study
really
found
when
sat
with
his
elbows
the
dusty
writing
table
the
deathlike
stillness
the
study
calm
and
significant
memories
the
last
few
days
rose
one
after
another
his
imagination
particularly
the
battle
borodino
and
that
vague
sense
his
own
insignificance
and
insincerity
compared
with
the
truth
simplicity
and
strength
the
class
men
mentally
classed
they
when
gerasim
roused
him
from
his
reverie
the
idea
occurred
him
taking
part
the
popular
defense
moscow
which
knew
was
projected
and
with
that
object
had
asked
gerasim
get
him
peasant
coat
and
pistol
confiding
him
his
intentions
remaining
joseph
alexeevich
house
and
keeping
his
name
secret
then
during
the
first
day
spent
inaction
and
solitude
tried
several
times
fix
his
attention
the
masonic
manuscripts
but
was
unable
the
idea
that
had
previously
occurred
him
the
cabalistic
significance
his
name
connection
with
bonaparte
more
than
once
vaguely
presented
itself
but
the
idea
that
russe
besuhof
was
destined
set
limit
the
power
the
beast
was
yet
only
one
the
fancies
that
often
passed
through
his
mind
and
left
trace
behind
when
having
bought
the
coat
merely
with
the
object
taking
part
among
the
people
the
defense
moscow
pierre
had
met
the
rostovs
and
natasha
had
said
him
are
you
remaining
moscow
how
splendid
the
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
that
really
would
good
thing
even
moscow
were
taken
for
him
remain
there
and
what
was
predestined
next
day
with
the
sole
idea
not
sparing
himself
and
not
lagging
any
way
behind
them
pierre
went
the
three
hills
gate
but
when
returned
the
house
convinced
that
moscow
would
not
defended
suddenly
felt
that
what
before
had
seemed
him
merely
possibility
had
now
become
absolutely
necessary
and
inevitable
must
remain
moscow
concealing
his
name
and
must
meet
napoleon
and
kill
him
and
either
perish
put
end
the
misery
all
europe
which
seemed
him
was
solely
due
napoleon
pierre
knew
all
the
details
the
attempt
bonaparte
life
german
student
vienna
and
knew
that
the
student
had
been
shot
and
the
risk
which
would
expose
his
life
carrying
out
his
design
excited
him
still
more
two
equally
strong
feelings
drew
pierre
irresistibly
this
purpose
the
first
was
feeling
the
necessity
sacrifice
and
suffering
view
the
common
calamity
the
same
feeling
that
had
caused
him
mozhaysk
the
twenty
fifth
and
make
his
way
the
very
thick
the
battle
and
had
now
caused
him
run
away
from
his
home
and
place
the
luxury
and
comfort
which
was
accustomed
sleep
hard
sofa
without
undressing
and
eat
the
same
food
gerasim
the
other
was
that
vague
and
quite
russian
feeling
contempt
for
everything
conventional
artificial
and
human
for
everything
the
majority
men
regard
the
greatest
good
the
world
pierre
had
first
experienced
this
strange
and
fascinating
feeling
the
sloboda
palace
when
had
suddenly
felt
that
wealth
power
and
life
all
that
men
painstakingly
acquire
and
guard
has
any
worth
has
only
reason
the
joy
with
which
can
all
renounced
was
the
feeling
that
induces
volunteer
recruit
spend
his
last
penny
drink
and
drunken
man
smash
mirrors
glasses
for
apparent
reason
and
knowing
that
will
cost
him
all
the
money
possesses
the
feeling
which
causes
man
perform
actions
which
from
ordinary
point
view
are
insane
test
were
his
personal
power
and
strength
affirming
the
existence
higher
nonhuman
criterion
life
from
the
very
day
pierre
had
experienced
this
feeling
for
the
first
time
the
sloboda
palace
had
been
continuously
under
its
influence
but
only
now
found
full
satisfaction
for
moreover
this
moment
pierre
was
supported
his
design
and
prevented
from
renouncing
what
had
already
done
that
direction
were
now
leave
moscow
like
everyone
else
his
flight
from
home
the
peasant
coat
the
pistol
and
his
announcement
the
rostovs
that
would
remain
moscow
would
all
become
not
merely
meaningless
but
contemptible
and
ridiculous
and
this
pierre
was
very
sensitive
pierre
physical
condition
always
the
case
corresponded
his
mental
state
the
unaccustomed
coarse
food
the
vodka
drank
during
those
days
the
absence
wine
and
cigars
his
dirty
unchanged
linen
two
almost
sleepless
nights
passed
short
sofa
without
bedding
all
this
kept
him
state
excitement
bordering
insanity
was
two
clock
the
afternoon
the
french
had
already
entered
moscow
pierre
knew
this
but
instead
acting
only
thought
about
his
undertaking
going
over
its
minutest
details
his
mind
his
fancy
did
not
clearly
picture
himself
either
the
striking
the
blow
the
death
napoleon
but
with
extraordinary
vividness
and
melancholy
enjoyment
imagined
his
own
destruction
and
heroic
endurance
yes
alone
for
the
sake
all
must
perish
thought
yes
will
approach
and
then
suddenly
with
pistol
dagger
but
that
all
the
same
not
but
the
hand
providence
that
punishes
thee
shall
say
thought
imagining
what
would
say
when
killing
napoleon
well
then
take
and
execute
went
speaking
himself
and
bowing
his
head
with
sad
but
firm
expression
while
pierre
standing
the
middle
the
room
was
talking
himself
this
way
the
study
door
opened
and
the
threshold
appeared
the
figure
makar
alexeevich
always
timid
before
but
now
quite
transformed
his
dressing
gown
was
unfastened
his
face
red
and
distorted
was
obviously
drunk
seeing
pierre
grew
confused
first
but
noticing
embarrassment
pierre
face
immediately
grew
bold
and
staggering
his
thin
legs
advanced
into
the
middle
the
room
they
frightened
said
confidentially
hoarse
voice

won
surrender

not
right

paused
and
then
suddenly
seeing
the
pistol
the
table
seized
with
unexpected
rapidity
and
ran
out
into
the
corridor
gerasim
and
the
porter
who
had
followed
makar
alexeevich
stopped
him
the
vestibule
and
tried
take
the
pistol
from
him
pierre
coming
out
into
the
corridor
looked
with
pity
and
repulsion
the
half
crazy
old
man
makar
alexeevich
frowning
with
exertion
held
the
pistol
and
screamed
hoarsely
evidently
with
some
heroic
fancy
his
head

board
them
you
shan
get

that

please

have
the
goodness

pleaded
gerasim
trying
carefully

alexeevich
the

back
the

who

shouted
makar
alexeevich
that
not

shouted
makar
alexeevich
brandishing
the
pistol

whispered
gerasim
the
porter
they
seized
makar
alexeevich
the
arms
and
dragged
him
the
door
the
vestibule
was
filled
with
the
discordant
sounds
struggle
and
tipsy
hoarse
voice
suddenly
fresh
sound
piercing
feminine
scream
reverberated
from
the
porch
and
the
cook
came
running
into
the
vestibule
them
gracious
heavens

horsemen
she
cried
gerasim
and
the
porter
let
makar
alexeevich
and
the
now
silent
corridor
the
sound
several
hands
knocking
the
front
door
could
heard
chapter

pierre
having
decided
that
until
had
carried
out
his
design
would
disclose
neither
his
identity
nor
his
knowledge
french
stood
the
half
open
door
the
corridor
intending
conceal
himself
soon
the
french
entered
but
the
french
entered
and
still
pierre
did
not
retire
irresistible
curiosity
kept
him
there
there
were
two
them
one
was
officer
tall
soldierly
handsome
man
the
other
evidently
private
orderly
sunburned
short
and
thin
with
sunken
cheeks
and
dull
expression
the
officer
walked
front
leaning
stick
and
slightly
limping
when
had
advanced
few
steps
stopped
having
apparently
decided
that
these
were
good
quarters
turned
round
the
soldiers
standing
the
entrance
and
loud
voice
command
ordered
them
put
the
horses
having
done
that
the
officer
lifting
his
elbow
with
smart
gesture
stroked
his
mustache
and
lightly
touched
his
hat
bonjour
compagnie
said
gaily
smiling
and
looking
about
him
good
day
everybody
one
gave
any
reply
vous
etes
bourgeois
the
officer
asked
gerasim
are
you
the
master
here
gerasim
gazed
the
officer
with
alarmed
and
inquiring
look
quartier

said
the
officer
looking
down
the
little
man
with
condescending
and
good
natured
smile
les

que

voyons

added
clapping
the
scared
and
silent
gerasim
the
shoulder
well
does

this

asked
again

looking
around
and
meeting

pierre
moved
away
from
the
door
quarters

the
french
are
good

what
the

again
the
officer
turned
gerasim
and
asked
him
show
him
the
rooms
the
house
master
not
here
don
understand
you
said
gerasim
trying
render
his
words
more
comprehensible
contorting
them
still
smiling
the
french
officer
spread
out
his
hands
before
gerasim
nose
intimating
that
did
not
understand
him
either
and
moved
limping
the
door
which
pierre
was
standing
pierre
wished
away
and
conceal
himself
but
that
moment
saw
makar
alexeevich
appearing
the
open
kitchen
door
with
the
pistol
his
hand
with
madman
cunning
makar
alexeevich
eyed
the
frenchman
raised
his
pistol
and
took
aim
board
them
yelled
the
tipsy
man
trying
press
the
trigger
hearing
the
yell
the
officer
turned
round
and
the
same
moment
pierre
threw
himself
the
drunkard
just
when
pierre
snatched
and
struck
the
pistol
makar
alexeevich
last
got
his
fingers
the
trigger
there
was
deafening
report
and
all
were
enveloped
cloud
smoke
the
frenchman
turned
pale
and
rushed
the
door
forgetting
his
intention
concealing
his
knowledge
french
pierre
snatching
away
the
pistol
and
throwing
down
ran
the
officer
and
addressed
him
french
you
are
not
wounded
asked
think
not
answered
the
frenchman
feeling
himself
over
but
have
had
lucky
escape
this
time
added
pointing
the
damaged
plaster
the
wall
who
that
man
said
looking
sternly
pierre
really
despair
what
has
occurred
said
pierre
rapidly
quite
forgetting
the
part
had
intended
play
unfortunate
madman
who
did
not
know
what
was
doing
the
officer
went
makar
alexeevich
and
took
him
the
collar
makar
alexeevich
was
standing
with
parted
lips
swaying
about
fall
asleep
leaned
against
the
wall
brigand
you
shall
pay
for
this
said
the
frenchman
letting
him
french
are
merciful
after
victory
but
not
pardon
traitors
added
with
look
gloomy
dignity
and
fine
energetic
gesture
pierre
continued
french
persuade
the
officer
not
hold
that
drunken
imbecile
account
the
frenchman
listened
silence
with
the
same
gloomy
expression
but
suddenly
turned
pierre
with
smile
for
few
seconds
looked
him
silence
his
handsome
face
assumed
melodramatically
gentle
expression
and
held
out
his
hand
you
have
saved
life
you
are
french
said
for
frenchman
that
deduction
was
indubitable
only
frenchman
could
perform
great
deed
and
save
his
life
the
life
ramballe
captain
the
light
regiment
was
undoubtedly
very
great
deed
but
however
indubitable
that
conclusion
and
the
officer
conviction
based
upon
pierre
felt
necessary
disillusion
him
russian
said
quickly
tut
tut
tut
tell
that

said
the
officer
waving
his
finger
before
his
nose
and
smiling
you
shall
tell
all
about
that
presently
delighted
meet
compatriot
well
and
what
are
with
this
man
added
addressing
himself
pierre
brother
even
pierre
were
not
frenchman
having
once
received
that
loftiest
human
appellations
could
not
renounce
said
the
officer
look
and
tone
reply
his
last
question
pierre
again
explained
who
makar
alexeevich
was
and
how
just
before
their
arrival
that
drunken
imbecile
had
seized
the
loaded
pistol
which
they
had
not
had
time
recover
from
him
and
begged
the
officer
let
the
deed
unpunished
the
frenchman
expanded
his
chest
and
made
majestic
gesture
with
his
arm
you
have
saved
life
you
are
french
you
ask
his
pardon
grant
you
lead
that
man
away
said
quickly
and
energetically
and
taking
the
arm
pierre
whom
had
promoted
frenchman
for
saving
his
life
went
with
him
into
the
room
the
soldiers
the
yard
hearing
the
shot
came
into
the
passage
asking
what
had
happened
and
expressed
their
readiness
punish
the
culprits
but
the
officer
sternly
checked
them
you
will
called
when
you
are
wanted
said
the
soldiers
went
out
again
and
the
orderly
who
had
meanwhile
had
time
visit
the
kitchen
came
his
officer
captain
there
soup
and
leg
mutton
the
kitchen
said
shall
serve
them
yes
and
some
wine
answered
the
captain
chapter
xxix
when
the
french
officer
went
into
the
room
with
pierre
the
latter
again
thought
his
duty
assure
him
that
was
not
french
and
wished
away
but
the
officer
would
not
hear
was
very
polite
amiable
good
natured
and
genuinely
grateful
pierre
for
saving
his
life
that
pierre
had
not
the
heart
refuse
and
sat
down
with
him
the
parlor
the
first
room
they
entered
pierre
assurances
that
was
not
frenchman
the
captain
evidently
not
understanding
how
anyone
could
decline
flattering
appellation
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
that
pierre
absolutely
insisted
passing
for
russian
let
but
for
all
that
would
forever
bound
pierre
gratitude
for
saving
his

replied
that

not

and
blushing
began
try

and
say
something
about

brought
with
them
ramballe
invited
pierre
share
his
dinner
and
himself
began
eat
greedily
and
quickly
like
healthy
and
hungry
man
munching
his
food
rapidly
with
his
strong
teeth
continually
smacking
his
lips
and
repeating
excellent
delicious
his

grew
red
and
was
covered
with
perspiration
pierre
was
hungry
and
shared
the

with
pleasure

the

brought
some
hot

morel
spoke
well
the

applied

and
poured
out
wine
for
himself
and
for
pierre
the
satisfaction
his
hunger
and
the
wine
rendered
the
captain
still
more
lively
and
chatted
incessantly
all
through

was
naively
and
good
humoredly
gay
real
and
pleased
with
himself
that
pierre
almost
winked

looked
merrily
him
probably
the

turned
the

thoughts
the
state

true
that

the

emitted

paris

pierre
finished
his
remark
for
him
the
captain
looked
pierre
had
habit
stopping
short
the
middle
his
talk
and
gazing
intently
with
his
laughing
kindly
eyes
well
you

told
you

should
have
wagered
that
you
were

and
having
uttered
this
compliment
again
gazed
him

off

noticing
that

conclusion
was
weaker
than

added
quickly

the
less
for
under
the
influence
the
wine
had
drunk
and
after
the
days
had
spent
alone
with
his
depressing
thoughts
pierre
involuntarily
enjoyed
talking
with
this
cheerful
and
good
natured
man
return
your
ladies
hear
they
are
lovely
what
wretched
idea
and
bury
themselves
the
steppes

have
missed
your

now
that
another

and
then
the
emperor
began
but
pierre
interrupted
him
the
emperor
pierre
repeated
and
his
face
suddenly
became
sad
and
embarrassed
the
emperor
the
emperor
generosity
mercy
justice
order
genius
that
what
the
emperor
ramballe
who
tell
you
assure
you
was
his
enemy
eight
years
ago
father
was
emigrant
count
but
that
man
has
vanquished
has
taken
hold
could
not
resist
the
sight
the
grandeur
and
glory
with
which
has
covered
france
when
understood
what
wanted
when
saw
that
was
preparing
bed
laurels
for
you
know
said
myself
that
monarch
and
devoted
myself
him
there
yes
mon
cher
the
greatest
man
the
ages
past
future
moscow
pierre
stammered
with
guilty
look
the
frenchman
looked
his
guilty
face
and
smiled
will
make
his
entry
tomorrow
replied
and
continued
his
talk
their
conversation
was
interrupted
the
cries
several
voices
the
gate
and
morel
who
came
say
that
some
wurttemberg
hussars
had
come
and
wanted
put
their
horses
the
yard
where
the
captain
horses
were
this
difficulty
had
arisen
chiefly
because
the
hussars
did
not
understand
what
was
said
them
french
the
captain
had
their
senior
sergeant
called
and
stern
voice
asked
him
what
regiment
belonged
who
was
his
commanding
officer
and
what
right
allowed
himself
claim
quarters
that
were
already
occupied
the
german
who
knew
little
french
answered
the
two
first
questions
giving
the
names
his
regiment
and
his
commanding
officer
but
reply
the
third
question
which
did
not
understand
said
introducing
broken
french
into
his
own
german
that
was
the
quartermaster
the
regiment
and
his
commander
had
ordered
him
occupy
all
the
houses
one
after
another
pierre
who
knew
german
translated
what
the
german
said
the
captain
and
gave
the
captain
reply
the
wurttemberg
hussar
german
when
had
understood
what
was
said
him
the
german
submitted
and
took
his
men
elsewhere
the
captain
went
out
into
the
porch
and
gave
some
orders
loud
voice
when
returned
the
room
pierre
was
sitting
the
same
place
before
with
his
head
his
hands
his
face
expressed
suffering
really
was
suffering
that
moment
when
the
captain
went
out
and
was
left
alone
suddenly
came
himself
and
realized
the
position
was
was
not
that
moscow
had
been
taken
that
the
happy
conquerors
were
masters
and
were
patronizing
him
painful
that
was
was
not
that
which
tormented
pierre
the
moment
was
tormented
the
consciousness
his
own
weakness
the
few
glasses
wine
had
drunk
and
the
conversation
with
this
good
natured
man
had
destroyed
the
mood
concentrated
gloom
which
had
spent
the
last
few
days
and
which
was
essential
for
the
execution
his
design
the
pistol
dagger
and
peasant
coat
were
ready
napoleon
was
enter
the
town
next
day
pierre
still
considered
that
would
useful
and
worthy
action
slay
the
evildoer
but
now
felt
that
would
not
did
not
know
why
but
felt
foreboding
that
would
not
carry
out
his
intention
struggled
against
the
confession
his
weakness
but
dimly
felt
that
could
not
overcome
and
that
his
former
gloomy
frame
mind
concerning
vengeance
killing
and
self
sacrifice
had
been
dispersed
like
dust
contact
with
the
first
man
met
the
captain
returned
the
room
limping
slightly
and
whistling
tune
the
frenchman
chatter
which
had
previously
amused
pierre
now
repelled
him
the
tune
was
whistling
his
gait
and
the
gesture
with
which
twirled
his
mustache
all
now
seemed
offensive
will
away
immediately
won
say
another
word
him
thought
pierre
thought
this
but
still
sat
the
same
place
strange
feeling
weakness
tied
him
the
spot
wished
get
and
away
but
could
not
the
captain
the
other
hand
seemed
very
cheerful
paced
and
down
the
room
twice
his
eyes
shone
and
his
mustache
twitched
were
smiling
himself
some
amusing
thought
the
colonel
those
wurttembergers
delightful
suddenly
said
german
but
nice
fellow
all
the
same
but
german
sat
down
facing
pierre
the
way
you
know
german
then
pierre
looked
him
silence
what
the
german
for
shelter
shelter
pierre
repeated
the
german
for
shelter
unterkunft
how
you
say
the
captain
asked
quickly
and
doubtfully
unterkunft
pierre
repeated
onterkoff
said
the
captain
and
looked
pierre
for
some
seconds
with
laughing
eyes
these
germans
are
first
rate
fools
don
you
think
monsieur
pierre
concluded
well
let
have
another
bottle
this
moscow
bordeaux
shall
morel
will
warm
another
little
bottle
morel
called
out
gaily
morel
brought
candles
and
bottle
wine
the
captain
looked
pierre
the
candlelight
and
was
evidently
struck
the
troubled
expression
his
companion
face
ramballe
with
genuine
distress
and
sympathy
his
face
went
pierre
and
bent
over
him
there
now
sad
said
touching
pierre
hand
have
upset
you
really
have
you
anything
against
asked
pierre
perhaps
the
state
affairs
pierre
did
not
answer
but
looked
cordially
into
the
frenchman
eyes
whose
expression
sympathy
was
pleasing
him
honestly
without
speaking
what
owe
you
feel
friendship
for
you
can
anything
for
you
dispose
for
life
and
death
say
with
hand
heart
said
striking
his
chest
thank
you
said
pierre
the
captain
gazed
intently
him
had
done
when
learned
that
shelter
was
unterkunft
german
and
his
face
suddenly
brightened
well
that
case
drink
our
friendship
cried
gaily
filling
two
glasses
with
wine
pierre
took
one
the
glasses
and
emptied
ramballe
emptied
his
too
again
pressed
pierre
hand
and
leaned
his
elbows
the
table
pensive
attitude
yes
dear
friend
began
such
fortune
caprice
who
would
have
said
that
should
soldier
and
captain
dragoons
the
service
bonaparte
used
call
him
yet
here
moscow
with
him
must
tell
you
mon
cher
continued
the
sad
and
measured
tones
man
who
intends
tell
long
story
that
our
name
one
the
most
ancient
france
and
with
frenchman
easy
and
naive
frankness
the
captain
told
pierre
the
story
his
ancestors
his
childhood
youth
and
manhood
and
all
about
his
relations
and
his
financial
and
family
affairs
pauvre
mere
playing
course
important
part
the
story
but
all
that
only
life
setting
the
real
thing
love
love
not
right
monsieur
pierre
said
growing
animated
another
glass
pierre
again
emptied
his
glass
and
poured
himself
out
third
women
women
and
the
captain
looking
with
glistening
eyes
pierre
began
talking
love
and
his
love
affairs
there
were
very
many
these
one
could
easily
believe
looking
the
officer
handsome
self
satisfied
face
and
noting
the
eager
enthusiasm
with
which
spoke
women
though
all
ramballe
love
stories
had
the
sensual
character
which
frenchmen
regard
the
special
charm
and
poetry
love
yet
told
his
story
with
such
sincere
conviction
that
alone
had
experienced
and
known
all
the
charm
love
and
described
women
alluringly
that
pierre
listened
him
with
curiosity
was
plain
that
amour
which
the
frenchman
was
fond
was
not
that
low
and
simple
kind
that
pierre
had
once
felt
for
his
wife
nor
was
the
romantic
love
stimulated
himself
that
experienced
for
natasha
ramballe
despised
both
these
kinds
love
equally
the
one
considered
the
love
clodhoppers
and
the
other
the
love
simpletons
amour
which
the
frenchman
worshiped
consisted
principally
the
unnaturalness
his
relation
the
woman
and
combination
incongruities
giving
the
chief
charm
the
feeling
thus
the
captain
touchingly
recounted
the
story
his
love
for
fascinating
marquise
thirty
five
and
the
same
time
for
charming
innocent
child
seventeen
daughter
the
bewitching
marquise
the
conflict
magnanimity
between
the
mother
and
the
daughter
ending
the
mother
sacrificing
herself
and
offering
her
daughter
marriage
her
lover
even
now
agitated
the
captain
though
was
the
memory
distant
past
then
recounted
episode
which
the
husband
played
the
part
the
lover
and
the
lover
assumed
the
role
the
husband
well
several
droll
incidents
from
his
recollections
germany
where
shelter
called
unterkunft
and
where
the
husbands
eat
sauerkraut
and
the
young
girls
are
too
blonde
finally
the
latest
episode
poland
still
fresh
the
captain
memory
and
which
narrated
with
rapid
gestures
and
glowing
face
was
how
had
saved
the
life
pole
general
the
saving
life
continually
occurred
the
captain
stories
and
the
pole
had
entrusted
him
his
enchanting
wife
parisienne
coeur
while
himself
entering
the
french
service
the
captain
was
happy
the
enchanting
polish
lady
wished
elope
with
him
but
prompted
magnanimity
the
captain
restored
the
wife
the
husband
saying
did
have
saved
your
life
and
save
your
honor
having
repeated
these
words
the
captain
wiped
his
eyes
and
gave
himself
shake
driving
away
the
weakness
which
assailed
him
this
touching
recollection
listening
the
captain
tales
pierre
often
happens
late
the
evening
and
under
the
influence
wine
followed
all
that
was
told
him
understood
all
and
the
same
time
followed
train
personal
memories
which
knew
not
why
suddenly
arose
his
mind
while
listening
these
love
stories
his
own
love
for
natasha
unexpectedly
rose
his
mind
and
going
over
the
pictures
that
love
his
imagination
mentally
compared
them
with
ramballe
tales
listening
the
story
the
struggle
between
love
and
duty
pierre
saw
before
his
eyes
every
minutest
detail
his
last
meeting
with
the
object
his
love
the
sukharev
water
tower
the
time
that
meeting
had
not
produced
effect
upon
him
had
not
even
once
recalled
but
now
seemed
him
that
that
meeting
had
had
something
very
important
and
poetic
peter
kirilovich
come
here
have
recognized
you
now
seemed
hear
the
words
she
had
uttered
and
see
before
him
her
eyes
her
smile
her
traveling
hood
and
stray
lock
her
hair
and
there
seemed
him
something
pathetic
and
touching
all
this
having
finished
his
tale
about
the
enchanting
polish
lady
the
captain
asked
pierre
had
ever
experienced
similar
impulse
sacrifice
himself
for
love
and
feeling
envy
the
legitimate
husband
challenged
this
question
pierre
raised
his
head
and
felt
need
express
the
thoughts
that
filled
his
mind
began
explain
that
understood
love
for
women
somewhat
differently
said
that
all
his
life
had
loved
and
still
loved
only
one
woman
and
that
she
could
never
his
tiens
said
the
captain
pierre
then
explained
that
had
loved
this
woman
from
his
earliest
years
but
that
had
not
dared
think
her
because
she
was
too
young
and
because
had
been
illegitimate
son
without
name
afterwards
when
had
received
name
and
wealth
dared
not
think
her
because
loved
her
too
well
placing
her
far
above
everything
the
world
and
especially
therefore
above
himself
when
had
reached
this
point
pierre
asked
the
captain
whether
understood
that
the
captain
made
gesture
signifying
that
even
did
not
understand
begged
pierre
continue
platonic
love
clouds
muttered
whether
was
the
wine
had
drunk
impulse
frankness
the
thought
that
this
man
did
not
and
never
would
know
any
those
who
played
part
his
story
whether
was
all
these
things
together
something
loosened

that

and
not

where

said
her
cousin
evidently
wishing
distract
her
mind
but
natasha
looked
her
not
understanding
what
was
said
her
and
again
fixed
her
eyes
the
corner
the
stove
she
had
been
this
condition
stupor
since
the
morning
when
sonya
the
surprise
and
annoyance
the
countess
had
for
some
unaccountable
reason
found
necessary
tell
natasha
prince
andrew
wound
and
his
being
with
their
party
the
countess
had
seldom
been
angry
with
anyone
she
was
with
sonya
sonya
had
cried
and
begged
forgiven
and
now
trying
atone
for
her
fault
paid
unceasing
attention
her
cousin

how
dreadfully
burning
said
she
what

asked
natasha

and
order
not

and
get
rid
her
she
turned
her
face
the
window
looked
out
such
way
that
was
evident
that
she
could
not
see
anything
and
again
settled
down
her
former
attitude
but
you
didn
see
yes
really
did
natasha
replied
voice
that
pleaded
left
peace
both
the
countess
and

understood
that
naturally
neither

nor
the

nor
anything

and
lay

touched
her
head
with
the

was

when

touched
her
forehead
with

and
finally
kissed

the

when
natasha
had
been
told
that
morning
that
prince

seriously
wounded
and
was
traveling
with
their
party
she
had
first
asked
many
questions
where
was
going
how

serious
and
could
she
see
him
but
after
she
had
been
told
that
she
could
not
see
him
that
was
seriously
wounded
but
that
his
life
was
not
danger
she
ceased
ask
questions
speak
all
evidently
disbelieving
what
they
told
her
and
convinced
that
say
what
she
might
she
would
still
told
the
same
all
the
way
she
had
sat
motionless
corner
the
coach
with
wide
open
eyes
and
the
expression
them
which
the
countess
knew
well
and
feared
much
and
now
she
sat
the
same
way

bench
where
she
had
seated
herself
arriving
she
was
planning
something
and
either
deciding
had
already
decided

the
moans

adjutant
could
heard
more
distinctly
she
put
her
head
out
into
the
damp
night
air
and
the
countess
saw
her
slim
neck
shaking
with
sobs
and
throbbing
against
the
window
frame
natasha
knew

who
was
moaning

had
thrown

and
put

when
her

sank
gently
onto
the
sheet
spread
over

and
lay
down

but
the
yard
there
was
light
from

and
half
away
and
through
the
night
came
the
noise
people
shouting

mamonov
cossacks
had
set
across
the
street
and
the
adjutant
unceasing
moans
could
still
heard
for
long
time
natasha
listened
attentively
the
sounds
that
reached
her
from
inside
and
outside
the
room
and
did
not
move
first
she
heard
her
mother
praying
and
sighing
and
the
creaking
her
bed
under
her
then
madame
schoss
familiar
whistling
snore
and
sonya

sonya
softly
after
short
silence
the
countess
spoke
again
but
this
time
one
replied
soon
after
that
natasha
heard
her
mother
even
breathing
natasha
did
not
move
though
her
little
bare
foot
thrust
out
from
under
the

the
moaning
the
adjutant
was
heard
natasha
sat
sonya

she
whispered
one
replied
natasha
rose
slowly
and
carefully
crossed
herself
and
stepped
cautiously
the
cold
and
dirty
floor
with
her
slim
supple
bare
feet
the
boards
the
floor
creaked
stepping
cautiously
from
one
foot
the
other
she
ran
like
kitten
the
few
steps
the
door
and
grasped
the
cold
door
handle
seemed
her
that
something
heavy
was
beating
rhythmically
against
all
the
walls
the
room
was
her
own
heart
sinking
with
alarm
and
terror
and
overflowing
with
love
she
opened
the
door
and
stepped
across
the
threshold
and
onto
the
cold
damp
earthen
floor
the
passage
the
cold
she
felt
refreshed
her
with
her
bare
feet

touched

over
him
and
opened
the
door
into
the

there
natasha
had
resolved

him
she
did
not

knew
the
meeting
would
painful
but
felt
the
more
convinced
that
was
necessary
all
day
she
had
lived
only
hope
seeing
him
that
night
but
now
that
the
moment
had
come
she
was
filled
with
dread
what
she
might
see
how
was
maimed
what
was
left
him
was
like
that
incessant
moaning
the
adjutant
yes
was
altogether
like
that
her
imagination
was
that
terrible
moaning
personified
when
she
saw
indistinct
shape
the
corner
and
mistook
his
knees
raised
under
the
quilt
for
his
shoulders
she
imagined
horrible
body
there
and
stood
still
terror
but
irresistible
impulse
drew
her
forward
she
cautiously
took
one
step
and
then
another
and
found

she
saw
prince

clearly
with
his
arms
outside
the

and
such

had
always
seen
him

the
same
ever
but
the
feverish
color
his

rapturously
turned
toward
her
and
especially
his

revealed
the

and
making

smell
mortifying
flesh
that
came
from

wound
began
examining

was
very
much
displeased
about
something
and
made
change

dressings

over

groaned
again
and

unconscious
and
delirious
from
the
agony

asking

put
under
him
what
trouble
would
you
said
have
not
got
one
please
get
for
and
put
under
for
moment
pleaded
piteous
voice
the
doctor
went
into
the
passage
wash
his
hands
you
fellows
have
conscience
said
the
valet
who
was
pouring
water
over
his
hands
for
just
one
moment
didn
look
after
you
such
pain
you
know
that
wonder
how
can
bear
the
lord
jesus
christ
thought
had
put
something
under
him
said
the
valet
the
first
time
prince
andrew
understood
where
was
and
what
was
the
matter
with
him
and
remembered
being
wounded
and
how
was
when
asked
carried
into
the
hut
after
his
caleche
had
stopped
mytishchi
after
growing
confused
from
pain
while
being
carried
into
the
hut
again
regained
consciousness
and
while
drinking
tea
once
more
recalled
all
that
had
happened
him
and
above
all
vividly
remembered
the
moment
the
ambulance
station
when
the
sight
the
sufferings
man
disliked
those
new
thoughts
had
come
him
which
promised
him
happiness
and
those
thoughts
though
now
vague
and
indefinite
again
possessed
his
soul
remembered
that
had
now
new
source
happiness
and
that
this
happiness
had
something
with
the
gospels
that
was
why
asked
for
copy
them
the
uncomfortable
position
which
they
had
put
him
and
turned
him
over
again
confused
his
thoughts
and
when
came
himself
third
time
was
the
complete
stillness
the
night
everybody
near
him
was
sleeping
cricket
chirped
from
across
the
passage
someone
was
shouting
and
singing
the
street
cockroaches
rustled
the
table
the
icons
and
the
walls
and
big
fly
flopped
the
head
the
bed
and
around
the
candle
beside
him
the
wick
which
was
charred
and
had
shaped
itself
like
mushroom
his
mind
was
not
normal
state
healthy
man
usually
thinks
feels
and
remembers
innumerable
things
simultaneously
but
has
the
power
and
will
select
one
sequence
thoughts
events
which
fix
his
whole
attention
healthy
man
can
tear
himself
away
from
the
deepest
reflections
say
civil
word
someone
who
comes
and
can
then
return
again
his
own
thoughts
but
prince
andrew
mind
was
not
normal
state
that
respect
all
the
powers
his
mind
were
more
active
and
clearer
than
ever
but
they
acted
apart
from
his
will
most
diverse
thoughts
and
images
occupied
him
simultaneously
times
his
brain
suddenly
began
work
with
vigor
clearness
and
depth
had
never
reached
when
was
health
but
suddenly
the
midst
its
work
would
turn
some
unexpected
idea
and
had
not
the
strength
turn
back
again
yes
new
happiness
was
revealed
which
man
cannot
deprived
thought
lay
the
semidarkness
the
quiet
hut
gazing
fixedly
before
him
with
feverish
wide
open
eyes
happiness
lying
beyond
material
forces
outside
the
material
influences
that
act
man
happiness
the
soul
alone
the
happiness
loving
every
man
can
understand
but
conceive
and
enjoin
was
possible
only
for
god
but
how
did
god
enjoin
that
law
and
why
was
the
son
and
suddenly
the
sequence
these
thoughts
broke
off
and
prince
andrew
heard
without
knowing
whether
was
delusion
reality
soft
whispering
voice
incessantly
and
rhythmically
repeating
piti
piti
piti
and
then
titi
and
then
again
piti
piti
piti
and
once
more
the
same
time
felt
that
above
his
face
above
the
very
middle
some
strange
airy
structure
was
being
erected
out
slender
needles
splinters
the
sound
this
whispered
music
felt
that
had
balance
carefully
though
was
difficult
that
this
airy
structure
should
not
collapse
but
nevertheless
kept
collapsing
and
again
slowly
rising
the
sound
whispered
rhythmic
music
stretches
stretches
spreading
out
and
stretching
said
prince
andrew
himself
while
listening
this
whispering
and
feeling
the
sensation
this
drawing
out
and
the
construction
this
edifice
needles
also
saw
glimpses
red
halo
round
the
candle
and
heard
the
rustle
the
cockroaches
and
the
buzzing
the
fly
that
flopped
against
his
pillow
and
his
face
each
time
the
fly
touched
his
face
gave
him
burning
sensation
and
yet
his
surprise
did
not
destroy
the
structure
though
knocked
against
the
very
region
his
face
where
was
rising
but
besides
this
there
was
something
else
importance
was
something
white
the
door
the
statue
sphinx
which
also
oppressed
him
but
perhaps
that
shirt
the
table
thought
and
that
legs
and
that
the
door
but
why
always
stretching
and
drawing
itself
out
and
piti
piti
piti
and
and
piti
piti
piti
that
enough
please
leave
off
prince
andrew
painfully
entreated
someone
and
suddenly
thoughts
and
feelings
again
swam
the
surface
his
mind
with
peculiar
clearness
and
force
yes
love
thought
again
quite
clearly
but
not
love
which
loves
for
something
for
some
quality
for
some
purpose
for
some
reason
but
the
love
which
while
dying
first
experienced
when
saw
enemy
and
yet
loved
him
experienced
that
feeling
love
which
the
very
essence
the
soul
and
does
not
require
object
now
again
feel
that
bliss
love
one
neighbors
love
one
enemies
love
everything
love
god
all
his
manifestations
possible
love
someone
dear
you
with
human
love
but
enemy
can
only
loved
divine
love
that
why
experienced
such
joy
when
felt
that
loved
that
man
what
has
become
him
alive
when
loving
with
human
love
one
may
pass
from
love
hatred
but
divine
love
cannot
change
neither
death
nor
anything
else
can
destroy
the
very
essence
the
soul
yet
how
many
people
have
hated
life
and
them
all
loved
and
hated
none
did
her
and
vividly
pictured
himself
natasha
not
had
done
the
past
with
nothing
but
her
charms
which
gave
him
delight
but
for
the
first
time
picturing
himself
her
soul
and
understood
her
feelings
her
sufferings
shame
and
remorse
now
understood
for
the
first
time
all
the
cruelty
his
rejection
her
the
cruelty
his
rupture
with
her
only
were
possible
for
see
her
once
more
just
once
looking
into
those
eyes
say
piti
piti
piti
and
and
piti
piti
piti
boom
flopped
the
fly
and
his
attention
was
suddenly
carried
into
another
world
world
reality
and
delirium
which
something
particular
was
happening
that
world
some
structure
was
still
being
erected
and
did
not
fall
something
was
still
stretching
out
and
the
candle
with
its
red
halo
was
still
burning
and
the
same
shirtlike
sphinx
lay
near
the
door
but
besides
all
this
something
creaked
there
was
whiff
fresh
air
and
new
white
sphinx
appeared
standing
the
door
and
that
sphinx
had
the
pale
face
and
shining
eyes
the
very
natasha
whom
had
just
been
thinking
how
oppressive
this
continual
delirium
thought
prince
andrew
trying
drive
that
face
from
his
imagination
but
the
face
remained
before
him
with
the
force
reality
and
drew
nearer
prince
andrew
wished
return
that
former
world
pure
thought
but
could
not
and
delirium
drew
him
back
into
its
domain
the
soft
whispering
voice
continued
its
rhythmic
murmur
something
oppressed
him
and
stretched
out
and
the
strange
face
was
before
him
prince
andrew
collected
all
his
strength
effort
recover
his
senses
moved
little
and
suddenly
there
was
ringing
his
ears
dimness
his
eyes
and
like
man
plunged
into
water
lost
consciousness
when
came
himself
natasha
that
same
living
natasha
whom
all
people
most
longed
love
with
this
new
pure
divine
love
that
had
been
revealed
him
was
kneeling
before
him
realized
that
was
the
real
living
natasha
and
was
not
surprised
but
quietly
happy
natasha
motionless
her
knees
she
was
unable
stir
with
frightened
eyes
riveted
him
was
restraining
her
sobs
her
face
was
pale
and
rigid
only
the
lower
part
something
quivered
prince
andrew
sighed
with
relief
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
you
said
how
fortunate
with
rapid
but
careful
movement
natasha
drew
nearer
him
her
knees
and
taking
his
hand
carefully
bent
her
face
over
and
began
kissing
just
touching
lightly
with
her
lips
forgive
she
whispered
raising
her
head
and
glancing
him
forgive
love
you
said
prince
andrew
forgive
forgive
what
asked
forgive
for
what
faltered
natasha
scarcely
audible
broken
whisper
and
began
kissing
his
hand
more
rapidly
just
touching
with
her
lips
love
you
more
better
than
before
said
prince
andrew
lifting
her
face
with
his
hand
look
into
her
eyes
those
eyes
filled
with
happy
tears
gazed
him
timidly
compassionately
and
with
joyous
love
natasha
thin
pale
face
with
its
swollen
lips
was
more
than
plain
was
dreadful
but
prince
andrew
did
not
see
that
saw
her
shining
eyes
which
were
beautiful
they
heard
the
sound
voices
behind
them
peter
the
valet
who
was
now
wide
awake
had
roused
the
doctor
timokhin
who
had
not
slept
all
because
the
pain
his
leg
had
long
been
watching
all
that
was
going
carefully
covering
his
bare
body
with
the
sheet
huddled
his
bench
what
this
said
the
doctor
rising
from
his
bed
please
away
madam
that
moment
maid
sent
the
countess
who
had
noticed
her
daughter
absence
knocked
the
door
like
somnambulist
aroused
from
her
sleep
natasha
went
out
the
room
and
returning
her
hut
fell
sobbing
her
bed
from
that
time
during
all
the
rest
the
rostovs
journey
every
halting
place
and
wherever
they
spent
night
natasha
never
left
the
wounded
bolkonski
and
the
doctor
had
admit
that
had
not
expected
from
young
girl
either
such
firmness
such
skill
nursing
wounded
man
dreadful
the
countess
imagined
would
should
prince
andrew
die
her
daughter
arms
during
the
journey
judging
what
the
doctor
said
seemed
might
easily
happen
she
could
not
oppose
natasha
though
with
the
intimacy
now
established
between
the
wounded
man
and
natasha
the
thought
occurred
that
should
recover
their
former
engagement
would
renewed
one
least
all
natasha
and
prince
andrew
spoke
this
the
unsettled
question
life
and
death
which
hung
not
only
over
bolkonski
but
over
all
russia
shut
out
all
other
considerations
chapter
xxxiii
the
third
september
pierre
awoke
late
his
head
was
aching
the
clothes
which
had
slept
without
undressing
felt
uncomfortable
his
body
and
his
mind
had
dim
consciousness
something
shameful
had
done
the
day
before
that
something
shameful
was
his
yesterday
conversation
with
captain
ramballe
was
eleven
the
clock
but
seemed
peculiarly
dark
out
doors
pierre
rose
rubbed
his
eyes
and
seeing
the
pistol
with
engraved
stock
which
gerasim
had
replaced
the
writing
table
remembered
where
was
and
what
lay
before
him
that
very
day
not
too
late
thought
probably
won
make
his
entry
into
moscow
before
noon
pierre
did
not
allow
himself
reflect
what
lay
before
him
but
hastened
act
after
arranging
his
clothes
took
the
pistol
and
was
about
out
but
then
occurred
him
for
the
first
time
that
certainly
could
not
carry
the
weapon
his
hand
through
the
streets
was
difficult
hide
such
big
pistol
even
under
his
wide
coat
could
not
carry
unnoticed
his
belt
under
his
arm
besides
had
been
discharged
and
had
not
had
time
reload
matter
dagger
will
said
himself
though
when
planning
his
design
had
more
than
once
come
the
conclusion
that
the
chief
mistake
made
the
student
had
been
try
kill
napoleon
with
dagger
but
his
chief
aim
consisted
not
carrying
out
his
design
but
proving
himself
that
would
not
abandon
his
intention
and
was
doing
all
could
achieve
pierre
hastily
took
the
blunt
jagged
dagger
green
sheath
which
had
bought
the
sukharev
market
with
the
pistol
and
hid
under
his
waistcoat
having
tied
girdle
over
his
coat
and
pulled
his
cap
low
his
head
pierre
went
down
the
corridor
trying
avoid
making
noise
meeting
the
captain
and
passed
out
into
the
street
the
conflagration
which
had
looked
with
much
indifference
the
evening
before
had
greatly
increased
during
the
night
moscow
was
fire
several
places
the
buildings
carriage
row
across
the
river
the
bazaar
and
the
povarskoy
well
the
barges
the
moskva
river
and
the
timber
yards
the
dorogomilov
bridge
were
all
ablaze
pierre
way
led
through
side
streets
the
povarskoy
and
from
there
the
church
nicholas
the
arbat
where
had
long
before
decided
that
the
deed
should
done
the
gates
most
the
houses
were
locked
and
the
shutters
the
streets
and
lanes
were
deserted
the
air
was
full
smoke
and
the
smell
burning
now
and
then
met
russians
with
anxious
and
timid
faces
and
frenchmen
with
air
not
the
city
but
the
camp
walking
the
middle
the
streets
both
the
russians
and
the
french
looked
pierre
with
surprise
besides
his
height
and
stoutness
and
the
strange
morose
look
suffering
his
face
and
whole
figure
the
russians
stared
pierre
because
they
could
not
make
out
what
class
could
belong
the
french
followed
him
with
astonishment
their
eyes
chiefly
because
pierre
unlike
all
the
other
russians
who
gazed
the
french
with
fear
and
curiosity
paid
attention
them
the
gate
one
house
three
frenchmen
who
were
explaining
something
some
russians
who
did
not
understand
them
stopped
pierre
asking
did
not
know
french
pierre
shook
his
head
and
went
another
side
street
sentinel
standing
beside
green
caisson
shouted
him
but
only
when
the
shout
was
threateningly
repeated
and
heard
the
click
the
man
musket
raised
did
pierre
understand
that
had
pass
the
other
side
the
street
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
what
went
around
him
carried
his
resolution
within
himself
terror
and
haste
like
something
dreadful
and
alien
him
for
after
the
previous
night
experience
was
afraid
losing
but
was
not
destined
bring
his
mood
safely
his
destination
and
even
had
not
been
hindered
anything
the
way
his
intention
could
not
now
have
been
carried
out
for
napoleon
had
passed
the
arbat
more
than
four
hours
previously
his
way
from
the
dorogomilov
suburb
the
kremlin
and
was
now
sitting
very
gloomy
frame
mind
royal
study
the
kremlin
giving
detailed
and
exact
orders
measures
taken
immediately
extinguish
the
fire
prevent
looting
and
reassure
the
inhabitants
but
pierre
did
not
know
this
was
entirely
absorbed
what
lay
before
him
and
was
tortured
those
are
who
obstinately
undertake
task
that
impossible
for
them
not
because
its
difficulty
but
because
its
incompatibility
with
their
natures
the
fear
weakening
the
decisive
moment
and
losing
his
self
esteem
though
heard
and
saw
nothing
around
him
found
his
way
instinct
and
did
not
wrong
the
side
streets
that
led
the
povarskoy
pierre
approached
that
street
the
smoke
became
denser
and
denser
even
felt
the
heat
the
fire
occasionally
curly
tongues
flame
rose
from
under
the
roofs
the
houses
met
more
people
the
streets
and
they
were
more
excited
but
pierre
though
felt
that
something
unusual
was
happening
around
him
did
not
realize
that
was
approaching
the
fire
was
going
along
foot
path
across
wide
open
space
adjoining
the
povarskoy
one
side
and
the
gardens
prince
gruzinski
house
the
other
pierre
suddenly
heard
the
desperate
weeping
woman
close
him
stopped
awakening
from
dream
and
lifted
his
head
the
side
the
path
the
dusty
dry
grass
all
sorts
household
goods
lay
heap
featherbeds
samovar
icons
and
trunks
the
ground
beside
the
trunks
sat
thin
woman
longer
young
with
long
prominent
upper
teeth
and
wearing
black
cloak
and
cap
this
woman
swaying
and
fro
and
muttering
something
was
choking
with
sobs
two
girls
about
ten
and
twelve
dressed
dirty
short
frocks
and
cloaks
were
staring
their
mother
with
look
stupefaction
their
pale
frightened
faces
the
youngest
child
boy
about
seven
who
wore
overcoat
and
immense
cap
evidently
not
his
own
was
crying
his
old
nurse
arms
dirty
barefooted
maid
was
sitting

and
having
undone
her
pale
colored
plait
was
pulling
straight
and
sniffing
her
singed
hair
the

with

shaped

and
showing
under
his
square

the
hair
smoothly
brushed
forward
over
his
temples
with
expressionless
face
was
moving
the
trunks
which
were
placed
one
another
and
was
dragging
some
garments
from
under
them
soon
she
saw
pierre
the
woman
almost
threw
herself
his
feet
dear

she
muttered
between
her
sobs

have
taken

added

the
woman
angrily

ceasing

she
went
addressing
pierre
rapidly
between
her
sobs
the

attention
was
directed
the
frenchman
the
frieze
gown
who
meanwhile
swaying
slowly
from
side
side
had
drawn
nearer
the
young
woman
and
taking
his
hands
from
his
pockets
had
seized
her
the
neck
the
beautiful
armenian
still
sat
motionless
and
the
same
attitude
with
her
long
lashes
drooping
she
did
not
see
feel
what
the
soldier
was
doing
her
while
pierre
was
running
the
few
steps
that
separated
him
from
the

the
tall
marauder
the

gown
was
already
tearing
from

young
armenian
was
wearing

the
young

clutching
her
neck
screamed
piercingly
let

the
soldier
his
round

throwing

cried
look
here
nonsense
pierre
was
such
transport
rage
that
remembered
nothing
and
his
strength
increased
tenfold
rushed
the
barefooted
frenchman
and
before
the
latter
had
time
draw
his
sword
knocked
him
off
his
feet
and
hammered
him
with
his
fists
shouts
approval
were
heard
from
the

moment

the
uhlans
came

pierre
and
the
frenchman
and
surrounded
them
pierre
remembered
nothing
what
happened
after
that
only
remembered
beating
someone
and
being
beaten
and
finally
feeling
that
his
hands
were
bound
and
that
crowd
french
soldiers
stood
around
him
and
were
searching
him

then
turned

pierre
looked
around
him
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
did
not
reply
his
face
probably
looked
very
terrible
for
the
officer
said
something
whisper
and
four
more
uhlans
left
the
ranks
and
placed
themselves

had
saved
what
does
she
want
murmured
she
bringing

just
saved
from

said
good

and
without
knowing
how
this
aimless
lie
had
escaped
him
went
along
with
resolute
and
triumphant
steps
between
the
french

the

went
its

there
were

replied
that

conversation
the
news
the
day
petersburg
was
the
illness
countess
bezukhova
she
had
fallen
ill
unexpectedly
few
days
previously
had
missed
several
gatherings
which
she
was
usually
ornament
and
was
said
receiving
one
and
instead
the
celebrated
petersburg
doctors
who
usually
attended
her
had
entrusted
herself
some
italian
doctor
who
was
treating
her
some
new
and
unusual
way
they
all
knew
very
well
that
the
enchanting
countess
illness
arose
from
inconvenience
resulting
from
marrying
two
husbands
the
same
time
and
that
the
italian
cure
consisted
removing
such
inconvenience
but

that

very
unfortunate
added
anna
pavlovna
supposing
that
these
words
anna
pavlovna
was
somewhat
lifting
the
veil
from
the
secret
the
countess
malady
unwary
young
man
ventured
express
surprise
that
well
known
doctors
had
not
been
called
and
that
the
countess
was
being
attended
charlatan
who
might
employ
dangerous
remedies
your
information
may
better
than
mine
anna
pavlovna
suddenly
and
venomously
retorted
the
inexperienced
young
man
but
know
good
authority
that
this
doctor
very
learned
and
able
man
private
physician
the
queen
spain
and
having
thus
demolished
the
young
man
anna
pavlovna
turned
another
group
where
bilibin
was
talking
about
the
austrians
having
wrinkled
his
face
was
evidently
preparing
smooth
out
again
and
utter
one
his
mots
think
delightful
said
referring
diplomatic
note
that
had
been
sent
vienna
with
some
austrian
banners
captured
from
the
french
wittgenstein
the
hero
petropol
was
then
called
petersburg
what
what
that
asked
anna
pavlovna
securing
silence
for
the
mot
which
she
had
heard
before
and
bilibin
repeated
the
actual
words
the
diplomatic
dispatch
which
had
himself
composed
the
emperor
returns
these
austrian
banners

loudly
and
unexpectedly
everybody
looked
him
understanding
what
meant
prince
hippolyte
himself
glanced
around
with
amused
surprise
knew
more
than
the
others
what
his
words
meant
during
his
diplomatic
career
had
more
than
once
noticed
that
such
utterances
were
received
very
witty
and
every
opportunity
uttered
that
way
the
first
words
that
entered
his
head
may
turn
out
very
well
thought
but
not
they
know
how
arrange
matters
and
really
during
the
awkward
silence
that
ensued
that
insufficiently
patriotic
person
entered
whom
anna
pavlovna
had
been
waiting
for
and
wished
convert
and
she
smiling
and
shaking
finger
hippolyte
invited
prince

and
bringing
him
two
candles
and
the

begged

amid

and
far
from

involuntarily
group
themselves
around

again
involuntarily
centered
round

incident

death
everybody
knew
him
the
emperor
liked
him
and
was
young
and
interesting
that
day
everyone
met
with

what
wonderful
coincidence
just
during
the

but
what
loss
kutaysov
how
sorry
what
did
tell
about
kutuzov
prince

now
said
with
prophet
pride
always
said

the

man
capable
defeating
napoleon
but
next
day
news
arrived
from
the
army
and
the
public
mood
grew
anxious
the
courtiers
suffered
because
the
suffering
the
suspense
occasioned
the

fancy
the
emperor
position
said
they
and
instead
extolling
kutuzov
they
had
done
the
day
before
they
condemned
him
the
cause
the
emperor
anxiety
that
day
prince
vasili
longer
boasted
his
protege
kutuzov
but
remained
silent
when
the
commander

was
mentioned
moreover
toward
evening
everything
conspired
make
petersburg
society
anxious
and
uneasy
terrible
piece
news
was
added

been
agreeable
mention
officially
large
gatherings
everyone
said
that
countess
bezukhova
had
died
terrible
attack
angina

but
intimate
circles
details
were
mentioned
how
the
private
physician
the
queen
spain
had
prescribed
small
doses
certain

produce
certain
effect
but
helene
tortured
the
fact
that

that
her

she
had
written
that
wretched
profligate
pierre
had
not
replied
had
suddenly
taken
very
large

and
had
died

before

was
said
that

and
the

had
turned
upon

the

had
produced
such
letters
from

the
occasion
his

from

with
the

who
had
never
seen

and
who
did
not

yet
felt
deeply
moved
wrote
when
appeared
before

with
the

our
most
gracious
sovereign
whose
flames
illumined
his
route
though
the
source
michaud
chagrin
must
have
been
different
from
that
which
caused
russians
grieve
had
such
sad
face
when
shown
into
the
emperor
study
that
the
latter
once
asked
have
you
brought
sad
news
colonel
very
sad
sire
replied
michaud
lowering
his
eyes
with
sigh
the
abandonment
moscow
have
they
surrendered
ancient
capital
without
battle
asked
the
emperor
quickly
his
face
suddenly
flushing
michaud
respectfully
delivered
the
message
kutuzov
had
entrusted
him
which
was
that
had
been
impossible
fight
before
moscow
and
that
the
only
remaining
choice
was
between
losing
the
army
well
moscow
losing
moscow
alone
the
field
marshal
had
choose
the
latter
the
emperor
listened
silence
not
looking
michaud
has
the
enemy
entered
the
city
asked
yes
sire
and
moscow
now
ashes
left
all
flames
replied
michaud
decided
tone
but
glancing
the
emperor
was
frightened
what
had
done
the
emperor
began
breathe
heavily
and
rapidly
his
lower
lip
trembled
and
tears
instantly
appeared
his
fine
blue
eyes
but
this
lasted
only
moment
suddenly
frowned
blaming
himself
for
his
weakness
and
raising
his
head
addressed
michaud
firm
voice
see
colonel
from
all
that
happening
that
providence
requires
great
sacrifices
ready
submit
myself
all
things
his
will
but
tell
michaud
how
did
you
leave
the
army
when
saw
ancient
capital
abandoned
without
battle
did
you
not
notice
discouragement
seeing
that
his
most
gracious
ruler
was
calm
once
more
michaud
also
grew
calm
but
was
not
immediately
ready
reply
the
emperor
direct
and
relevant
question
which
required
direct
answer
sire
will
you
allow
speak
frankly
befits
loyal
soldier
asked
gain
time
colonel
always
require
replied
the
emperor
conceal
nothing
from
wish
know
absolutely
how
things
are
sire
said
michaud
with
subtle
scarcely
perceptible
smile
his
lips
having
now
prepared
well
phrased
reply
sire
left
the
whole
army
from
its
chiefs
the
lowest
soldier
without
exception
desperate
and
agonized
terror
how
that
the
emperor
interrupted
him
frowning
sternly
would
misfortune
make
russians
lose
heart
never
michaud
had
only
waited
for
this
bring
out
the
phrase
had
prepared
sire
said
with
respectful
playfulness
they
are
only
afraid
lest
your
majesty
the
goodness
your
heart
should
allow
yourself
persuaded
make
peace
they
are
burning
for
the
combat
declared
this
representative
the
russian
nation
and
prove
your
majesty
the
sacrifice
their
lives
how
devoted
they
are
said
the
emperor
reassured
and
with
kindly
gleam
his
eyes
patted
michaud
the
shoulder
you
set
ease
colonel
bent
his
head
and
was
silent
for
some
time
well
then
back
the
army
said
drawing
himself
his
full
height
and
addressing
michaud
with
gracious
and
majestic
gesture
and
tell
our
brave
men
and
all
good
subjects
wherever
you
that
when
have
not
soldier
left
shall
put
myself
the
head
beloved
nobility
and
good
peasants
and
use
the
last
resources
empire
still
offers
more
than
enemies
suppose
said
the
emperor
growing
more
and
more
animated
but
should
ever
ordained
divine
providence
continued
raising
heaven
his
fine
eyes
shining
with
emotion
that
dynasty
should
cease
reign
the
throne
ancestors
then
after
exhausting
all
the
means
command
shall
let
beard
grow
here
pointed
halfway
down
his
chest
and
and
eat
potatoes
with
the
meanest
peasants
rather
than
sign
the
disgrace
country
and
beloved
people
whose
sacrifices
know
how
appreciate
having
uttered
these
words
agitated
voice
the
emperor
suddenly
turned
away
hide
from
michaud
the
tears
that
rose
his
eyes
and
went
the
further
end
his
study
having
stood
there
few
moments
strode
back
michaud
and
pressed
his
arm
below
the
elbow
with
vigorous
movement
the
emperor
mild
and
handsome
face
was
flushed
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
resolution
and
anger
colonel
michaud
not
forget
what
say
you
here
perhaps
may
recall
with
pleasure
someday
napoleon
said
the
emperor
touching
his
breast
can
longer
both
reign
together
have
learned
know
him
and
will
not
deceive
any
more
and
the
emperor
paused
with
frown
when
heard
these
words
and
saw
the
expression
firm
resolution
the
emperor
eyes
michaud
quoique
etranger
russe
coeur
ame
that
solemn
moment
felt
himself
enraptured
all
that
had
heard
used
afterwards
say
and
gave
expression
his
own
feelings
and
those
the
russian
people
whose
representative
considered
himself
the
following
words
sire
said
your
majesty
this
moment
signing
the
glory
the
nation
and
the
salvation
europe
with
inclination
the
head
the
emperor
dismissed
him
chapter
natural
for
who
were
not
living
those
days
imagine
that
when
half
russia
had
been
conquered
and
the
inhabitants
were
fleeing
distant
provinces
and
one
levy
after
another
was
being
raised
for
the
defense
the
fatherland
all
russians
from
the
greatest
the
least
were
solely
engaged
sacrificing
themselves
saving
their
fatherland
weeping
over
its
downfall
the
tales
and
descriptions
that
time
without
exception
speak
only
the
self
sacrifice
patriotic
devotion
despair
grief
and
the
heroism
the
russians
but
was
not
really
appears
because
see
only
the
general
historic
interest
that
time
and
not
see
all
the
personal
human
interests
that
people
had
yet
reality
those
personal
interests
the
moment
much
transcend
the
general
interests
that
they
always
prevent
the
public
interest
from
being
felt
even
noticed
most
the
people
that
time
paid
attention
the
general
progress
events
but
were
guided
only
their
private
interests
and
they
were
the
very
people
whose
activities
that
period
were
most
useful
those
who
tried
understand
the
general
course
events
and
take
part
self
sacrifice
and
heroism
were
the
most
useless
members
society
they
saw
everything
upside
down
and
all
they
did
for
the
common
good
turned
out
useless
and
foolish
like
pierre
and
mamonov
regiments
which
looted
russian
villages
and
the
lint
the
young
ladies
prepared
and
that
never
reached
the
wounded
and
even
those
fond
intellectual
talk
and
expressing

evidently
pleased
with
his

received
nicholas
brusquely
imagining
this
characteristically
military
and
questioned
him
with
important
air
considering
the

and
approving
and
disapproving

the

fourteen
miles
away
who
had
the

everything
seemed
him
pleasant
and
easy
during

his
stay
voronezh
and
usually
happens
when

everything
went
well
and
easily
the

nicholas
went
was
bachelor
old
cavalryman
horse
fancier
sportsman
the
possessor
some
century
old
brandy
and
some
old
hungarian

who
had
snuggery
where
smoked

who
owned
some
splendid
horses

thousand

and
taking
rather
too
much
the

nicholas
having
exchanged
kisses
with
the
landowner
with
whom
was
already
the
friendliest
terms
galloped
back
over
abominable

continually
urging
the

for
the

when
had
changed
poured
water
over
his

and
scented
himself
nicholas
arrived
the
governor
rather
late
but
with
the
phrase
better
late
than
never
his
lips
was
not
ball
nor
had
dancing
been
announced
but
everyone
knew
that
catherine
petrovna
would
play
valses
and
the
ecossaise
the
clavichord
and
that
there
would
dancing
and
everyone
had
come
ball
provincial
life
went
very
much
usual
but
with
this
difference
that
was
livelier
the
towns
consequence
the
arrival
many
wealthy
families
from
moscow
and
everything
that
went
russia
that
time
special
recklessness
was
noticeable
for
penny
for
pound
who
cares
spirit
and
the
inevitable
small
talk
instead
turning
the
weather
and
mutual
acquaintances
now
turned
moscow
the
army
and
napoleon
the
society
gathered
together
the
governor
was
the
best
voronezh
there
were
great
many
ladies
and
some
nicholas
moscow
acquaintances
but
there
were
men
who
could
all
vie
with
the
cavalier
george
the
hussar
remount
officer
the
good
natured
and
well
bred
count
rostov
among
the
men
was
italian
prisoner
officer
the
french
army
and
nicholas
felt
that
the
presence
that
prisoner
enhanced
his
own
importance
russian
hero
the
italian
was
were
war
trophy
nicholas
felt
this
seemed
him
that
everyone
regarded
the
italian
the
same
light
and
treated
him
cordially
though
with
dignity
and
restraint
soon
nicholas
entered
his
hussar
uniform
diffusing
around
him
fragrance
perfume
and
wine
and
had
uttered
the
words
better
late
than
never
and
heard
them
repeated
several
times
others
people
clustered
around
him
all
eyes
turned
him
and
felt
once
that
had
entered
into
his
proper
position
the
province
that
universal
favorite
very
pleasant
position
and
intoxicatingly
after
his
long
privations
posting
stations
inns
and
the
landowner
snuggery
maidservants
had
been
flattered
his
notice
and
here
too
the
governor
party
there
were
seemed
nicholas
inexhaustible
number
pretty
young
women
married
and
unmarried
impatiently
awaiting
his
notice
the
women
and
girls
flirted
with
him
and
from
the
first
day
the
people
concerned
themselves
get
this
fine
young
daredevil
hussar
married
and
settled
down
among
these
was
the
governor
wife
herself
who
welcomed
rostov
near
relative
and
called
him
nicholas
catherine
petrovna
did
actually
play
valses
and
the
ecossaise
and
dancing
began
which
nicholas
still
further
captivated
the
provincial
society
his
agility
his
particularly
free
manner
dancing
even
surprised
them
all
nicholas
was
himself
rather
surprised
the
way
danced
that
evening
had
never
danced
like
that
moscow
and
would
even
have
considered
such
very
free
and
easy
manner
improper
and
bad
form
but
here
felt
incumbent
him
astonish
them
all
something
unusual
something
they
would
have
accept
the
regular
thing
the
capital
though
new
them
the
provinces
all
the
evening
nicholas
paid
attention
blue
eyed
plump
and
pleasing
little
blonde
the
wife
one
the
provincial
officials
with
the
naive
conviction
young
men
merry
mood
that
other
men
wives
were
created
for
them
rostov
did
not
leave
the
lady
side
and
treated
her
husband
friendly
and
conspiratorial
style
without
speaking
they
knew
how
capitally
nicholas
and
the
lady
would
get
together
the
husband
however
did
not
seem
share
that
conviction
and
tried
behave
morosely
with
rostov
but
the
latter
good
natured
naivete
was
boundless
that
sometimes
even
involuntarily
yielded
nicholas
good
humor
toward
the
end
the
evening
however
the
wife
face
grew
more
flushed
and
animated
the
husband
became
more
and
more
melancholy
and
solemn
though
there
were
but
given
amount
animation
between
them
and
the
wife
share
increased
the
husband
diminished
chapter
nicholas
sat
leaning
slightly
forward
armchair
bending
closely
over
the
blonde
lady
and
paying
her
mythological
compliments
with
smile
that
never
left
his
face
jauntily
shifting
the
position
his
legs
their
tight
riding
breeches
diffusing
odor
perfume
and
admiring
his
partner
himself
and
the
fine
outlines
his
legs
their
well
fitting
hessian
boots
nicholas
told
the
blonde
lady
that
wished
run
away
with
certain
lady
here
voronezh
which
lady
charming
lady
divine
one
her
eyes
nicholas
looked
his
partner
are
blue
her
mouth
coral
and
ivory
her
figure
glanced
her
shoulders
like
diana
the
husband
came
and
sullenly
asked
his
wife
what
she
was
talking
about
nikita
ivanych
cried
nicholas
rising
politely
and
wishing
nikita
ivanych
share
his
joke
began
tell
him
his
intention
elope
with
blonde
lady
the

smiled
gloomily
the
wife
gaily
the
governor
good
natured
wife
came
with
look
disapproval
anna
ignatyevna
wants

said
she
pronouncing
the

that
nicholas
once
understood
that
anna

was
very
important
person
come
nicholas
you
know
you
let
call

nicholas
her

princess
bolkonskaya
she
here

with
her

oho

very
well

well
what
fellow
you

the
governor
wife
led
him
tall
and
very
stout
old
lady
with
blue
headdress
who
had
just
finished
her
game
cards
with
the
most
important
personages
the
town
this
was
malvintseva
princess
mary
aunt
her
mother
side
rich
childless
widow
who
always
lived
voronezh
when
rostov
approached
her
she
was
standing
settling
for
the
game
she
looked
him
and
screwing
her
eyes
sternly
continued
upbraid
the
general
who
had
won
from
her
very
pleased
mon
cher
she
then
said
holding
out
her
hand
nicholas
pray
come
and
see
after
few
words
about
princess
mary
and
her
late
father
whom
malvintseva
had
evidently
not
liked
and
having
asked
what
nicholas
knew
prince
andrew
who
also
was
evidently
favorite
hers
the
important
old
lady
dismissed
nicholas
after
repeating
her
invitation
come
see
her
nicholas
promised
come
and
blushed
again
bowed
the
mention
princess
mary
experienced
feeling
shyness
and
even
fear
which
himself
did
not
understand
when
had
parted
from
malvintseva
nicholas
wished
return
the
dancing
but
the
governor
little
wife
placed
her
plump
hand
his
sleeve
and
saying
that
she
wanted
have
talk
with
him
led
him
her
sitting
room
from
which
those
who
were
there
immediately
withdrew
not
her
way
you
know
dear
boy
began
the
governor
wife
with
serious
expression
her
kind
little
face
that
really
would
the
match
for
you
would
you
like
arrange
whom
you
mean
aunt
asked
nicholas
will
make
match
for
you
with
the
princess
catherine
petrovna
speaks
lily
but
say
the
princess
you
want
sure
your
mother
will
grateful
what
charming
girl
she
really
and
she
not
all
plain
either
not
all
replied
nicholas
offended
the
idea
befits
soldier
aunt
don
force
myself
anyone
refuse
anything
said
before
had
time
consider
what
was
saying
well
then
remember
this
not
joke
course
not
yes
yes
the
governor
wife
said
talking
herself
but
dear
boy
among
other
things
you
are
too
attentive
the
other
the
blonde
one
sorry
for
the
husband
really
are
good
friends
with
him
said
nicholas
the
simplicity
his
heart
did
not
enter
his
head
that
pastime
pleasant
himself
might
not
pleasant
someone
else
but
what
nonsense
have
been
saying
the
governor
wife
thought
nicholas
suddenly
supper
she
will
really
begin
arrange
match
and
sonya
and
taking
leave
the
governor
wife
when
she
again
smilingly
said
him
well
then
remember
drew
her
aside
but
see
here
tell
the
truth
aunt
what
dear
come
let
sit
down
here
said
she
nicholas
suddenly
felt
desire
and
need
tell
his
most
intimate
thoughts
which
would
not
have
told
his
mother
his
sister
his
friend
this
woman
who
was
almost
stranger
when
afterwards
recalled
that
impulse
unsolicited
and
inexplicable
frankness
which
had
very
important
results
for
him
seemed
him
seems
everyone
such
cases
that
was
merely
some
silly
whim
that
seized
him
yet
that
burst
frankness
together
with
other
trifling
events
had
immense
consequences
for
him
and
for
all
his
family
you
see
aunt
mamma
has
long
wanted
marry
heiress
but
the
very
idea
marrying
for
money
repugnant
yes
understand
said
the
governor
wife
but
princess
bolkonskaya
that
another
matter
will
tell
you
the
truth
the
first
place
like
her
very
much
feel
drawn
her
and
then
after
met
her
under
such
circumstances
strangely
the
idea
often
occurred
this
fate
especially
you
remember
that
mamma
had
long
been
thinking
but
had
never
happened
meet
her
before
somehow
had
always
happened
that
did
not
meet
and
long
sister
natasha
was
engaged
her
brother
was
course
out
the
question
for
think
marrying
her
and
must
needs
happen
that
should
meet
her
just
when
natasha
engagement
had
been
broken
off
and
then
everything
you
see
never
told
this
anyone
and
never
will
only
you
the
governor
wife
pressed
his
elbow
gratefully
you
know
sonya
cousin
love
her
and
promised
marry
her
and
will
you
see
there
can
question
about
said
nicholas
incoherently
and
blushing
dear
boy
what
way
look
you
know
sonya
has
nothing
and
you
yourself
say
your
papa
affairs
are
very
bad
way
and
what
about
your
mother
would
kill
her
that
one
thing
and
what
sort
life
would
for
sonya
she
girl
with
heart
your
mother
despair
and
you
all
ruined
dear
you
and
sonya
ought
understand
that
nicholas
remained
silent
comforted
him
hear
these
arguments
all
the
same
aunt
impossible
rejoined
with
sigh
after
short
pause
besides
would
the
princess
have
and
besides
she
now
mourning
how
can
one
think
but
you
don
suppose
going
get
you
married
once
there
always
right
way
doing
things
replied
the
governor
wife
what
matchmaker
you
are
aunt
said
nicholas
kissing
her
plump
little
hand
chapter
reaching
moscow
after
her
meeting
with
rostov
princess
mary
had
found
her
nephew
there
with
his
tutor
and
letter
from
prince
andrew
giving
her
instructions
how
get
her
aunt
malvintseva
voronezh
that
feeling
akin
temptation
which
had
tormented
her
during
her
father
illness
since
his
death
and
especially
since
her
meeting
with
rostov
was
smothered
arrangements
for
the
journey
anxiety
about
her
brother
settling
new
house
meeting
new
people
and
attending
her
nephew
education
she
was
sad
now
after
month
passed
quiet
surroundings
she
felt
more
and
more
deeply
the
loss
her
father
which
was
associated
her
mind
with
the
ruin
russia
she
was
agitated
and
incessantly
tortured
the
thought
the
dangers
which
her
brother
the
only
intimate
person
now
remaining
her
was
exposed
she
was
worried
too
about
her
nephew
education
for
which
she
had
always
felt
herself
incompetent
but
the
depths
her
soul
she
felt
peace
peace
arising
from
consciousness
having
stifled
those
personal
dreams
and
hopes
that
had
been
the
point
awakening
within
her
and
were
related
her
meeting
with
rostov
the
day
after
her
party
the
governor
wife
came
see
malvintseva
and
after
discussing
her
plan
with
the
aunt
remarked
that
though
under
present
circumstances
formal
betrothal
was
course
not
thought
all
the
same
the
young
people
might
brought
together
and
could
get
know
one
another
malvintseva
expressed
approval
and
the
governor
wife
began
speak
rostov
mary
presence
praising
him
and
telling
how
had
blushed
when
princess
mary
name
was
mentioned
but
princess
mary
experienced
painful
rather
than
joyful
feeling
her
mental
tranquillity
was
destroyed
and
desires
doubts
self
reproach
and
hopes
reawoke
during
the
two
days
that
elapsed
before
rostov
called
princess
mary
continually
thought
how
she
ought
behave
him
first
she
decided
not
come
the
drawing
room
when
called
see
her
aunt
that
would
not
proper
for
her
her
deep
mourning
receive
visitors
then
she
thought
this
would
rude
after
what
had
done
for
her
then
occurred
her
that
her
aunt
and
the
governor
wife
had
intentions
concerning
herself
and
rostov
their
looks
and
words
times
seemed
confirm
this
supposition
then
she
told
herself
that
only
she
with
her
sinful
nature
could
think
this
them
they
could
not
forget
that
situated
she
was
while
still
wearing
deep
mourning
such
matchmaking
would
insult
her
and
her
father
memory
assuming
that
she
did
down
see
him
princess
mary
imagined
the
words
would
say
her
and
what
she
would
say
him
and
these
words
sometimes
seemed
undeservedly
cold
and
then
mean
too
much
more
than
anything
she
feared
lest
the
confusion
she
felt
might
overwhelm
her
and
betray
her
soon
she
saw
him
but
when
sunday
after
church
the
footman
announced
the
drawing
room
that
count
rostov
had
called
the
princess
showed
confusion
only
slight
blush
suffused
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
lit
with
new
and
radiant
light
you
have
met
him
aunt
said
she
calm
voice
unable
herself
understand
that
she
could
outwardly
calm
and
natural
when
rostov
entered
the
room
the
princess
dropped
her
eyes
for
instant
give
the
visitor
time
greet
her
aunt
and
then
just
nicholas
turned
her
she
raised
her
head
and
met
his
look
with
shining
eyes
with
movement
full
dignity
and
grace
she
half
rose
with
smile
pleasure
held
out
her
slender
delicate
hand
him
and
began
speak
voice
which
for
the
first
time
new
deep
womanly
notes
vibrated
mademoiselle
bourienne
who
was
the
drawing
room
looked
princess
mary
bewildered
surprise
herself
consummate
coquette
she
could
not
have
maneuvered
better
meeting
man
she
wished
attract
either
black
particularly
becoming
her
she
really
has
greatly
improved
without
having
noticed
and
above
all
what
tact
and
grace
thought
mademoiselle
bourienne
had
princess
mary
been
capable
reflection
that
moment
she
would
have
been
more
surprised
than
mademoiselle
bourienne
the
change
that
had
taken
place
herself
from
the
moment
she
recognized
that
dear
loved
face
new
life
force
took
possession
her
and
compelled
her
speak
and
act
apart
from
her
own
will
from
the
time
rostov
entered
her
face
became
suddenly
transformed
was
light
had
been
kindled
carved
and
painted
lantern
and
the
intricate
skillful
artistic
work
its
sides
that
previously
seemed
dark
coarse
and
meaningless
was
suddenly
shown
unexpected
and
striking
beauty
for
the
first
time
all
that
pure
spiritual
inward
travail
through
which
she
had
lived
appeared
the
surface
all
her
inward
labor
her
dissatisfaction
with
herself
her
sufferings
her
strivings
after
goodness
her
meekness
love
and
self
sacrifice
all
this
now
shone
those
radiant
eyes
her
delicate
smile
and
every
trait
her
gentle
face
rostov
saw
all
this
clearly
had
known
her
whole
life
felt
that
the
being
before
him
was
quite
different
from
and
better
than
anyone
had
met
before
and
above
all
better
than
himself
their
conversation
was
very
simple
and
unimportant
they
spoke
the
war
and
like
everyone
else
unconsciously
exaggerated
their
sorrow
about
they
spoke
their
last
meeting
nicholas
trying
change
the
subject
they
talked
the
governor
kind
wife
nicholas
relations
and
princess
mary
she
did
not
talk
about
her
brother
diverting
the
conversation
soon
her
aunt
mentioned
andrew
evidently
she
could
speak
russia
misfortunes
with
certain
artificiality
but
her
brother
was
too
near
her
heart
and
she
neither
could
nor
would
speak
lightly
him
nicholas
noticed
this
noticed
every
shade
princess
mary
character
with
observation
unusual
him
and
everything
confirmed
his
conviction
that
she
was
quite
unusual
and
extraordinary
being
nicholas
blushed
and
was
confused
when
people
spoke
him
about
the
princess
she
did
when
was
mentioned
and
even
when
thought
her
but
her
presence
felt
quite
ease
and
said
not
all
what
had
prepared
but
what
quite
appropriately
occurred
him
the
moment
when
pause
occurred
during
his
short
visit
nicholas
usual
when
there
are
children
turned
prince
andrew
little
son
caressing
him
and
asking
whether
would
like
hussar
took
the
boy
his
knee
played
with
him
and
looked
round
princess
mary
with
softened
happy
timid
look
she
watched
the
boy
she
loved
the
arms
the
man
she
loved
nicholas
also
noticed
that
look
and
understanding
flushed
with
pleasure
and
began
kiss
the
boy
with
good
natured
playfulness
she
was
mourning
princess
mary
did
not
out
into
society
and
nicholas
did
not
think
the
proper
thing
visit
her
again
but
all
the
same
the
governor
wife
went
with
her
matchmaking
passing
nicholas
the
flattering
things
princess
mary
said
him
and
vice
versa
and
insisting
his
declaring
himself
princess
mary
for
this
purpose
she
arranged
meeting
between
the
young
people
the
bishop
house
before
mass
though
rostov
told
the
governor
wife
that
would
not
make
any
declaration
princess
mary
promised
tilsit
rostov
had
not
allowed
himself
doubt
that
what
everybody
considered
right
was
right
now
after
short
but
sincere
struggle
between
his
effort
arrange
his
life
his
own
sense
justice
and
obedient
submission
circumstances
chose
the
latter
and
yielded
the
power
felt
irresistibly
carrying
him
knew
not
where
knew
that
after
his
promise
sonya
would
what
deemed
base
declare
his
feelings
princess
mary
and
knew
that
would
never
act
basely
but
also
knew
rather
felt
the
bottom
his
heart
that
resigning
himself
now
the
force
circumstances
and
those
who
were
guiding
him
was
not
only
doing
nothing
wrong
but
was
doing
something
very
important
more
important
than
anything
had
ever
done
his
life
after
meeting
princess
mary
though
the
course
his
life
went
externally
before
all
his
former
amusements
lost
their
charm
for
him
and
often
thought
about
her
but
never
thought
about
her
had
thought
all
the
young
ladies
without
exception
whom
had
met
society
nor
had
for
long
time
and
one
time
rapturously
thought
about
sonya
had
pictured
each
those
young
ladies
almost
all
honest
hearted
young
men
that
possible
wife
adapting
her
his
imagination
all
the
conditions
married
life
white
dressing
gown
his
wife
the
tea
table
his
wife
carriage
little
ones
mamma
and
papa
their
relations
her
and
and
these
pictures
the
future
had
given
him
pleasure
but
with
princess
mary
whom
they
were
trying
get
him
engaged
could
never
picture
anything
future
married
life
tried
his
pictures
seemed
incongruous
and
false
made
him
afraid
chapter
vii
the
dreadful
news
the
battle
borodino
our
losses
killed
and
wounded
and
the
still
more
terrible
news
the
loss
moscow
reached
voronezh
the
middle
september
princess
mary
having
learned
her
brother
wound
only
from
the
gazette
and
having
definite
news
him
prepared
nicholas
heard
had
not

her
again
himself
set
off
search
prince
andrew
when
received
the
news
the
battle
borodino
and
the
abandonment
moscow
rostov
was
not
seized
with
despair
anger
the
desire
for
vengeance
any
feeling
that
kind
but
everything
voronezh
suddenly
seemed
him
dull
and
tiresome
and
experienced
indefinite
feeling
shame
and
awkwardness
the
conversations
heard
seemed
him
insincere
did
not
know
how
judge
all
these
affairs
and
felt
that
only
the
regiment
would
everything
again
become
clear
him
made
haste
finish
buying
the
horses
and
often
became
unreasonably
angry
with
his
servant
and
squadron
quartermaster
few
days
before
his
departure
special
thanksgiving
which
nicholas
was
present
was
held
the
cathedral
for
the
russian
victory
stood
little
behind
the
governor
and
held
himself
with
military
decorum
through
the
service
meditating
great
variety
subjects
when
the
service
was
over
the
governor
wife
beckoned
him
her
have
you
seen
the
princess
she
asked
indicating
with
movement
her
head
lady
standing
the
opposite
side
beyond
the
choir
nicholas
immediately
recognized
princess
mary
not
much
the
profile
saw
under
her
bonnet
the
feeling
solicitude
timidity
and
pity
that
immediately
overcame
him
princess
mary
evidently
engrossed
her
thoughts
was
crossing
herself
for
the
last
time
before
leaving
the
church
nicholas
looked
her
face
with
surprise
was
the
same
face
had
seen
before
there
was
the
same
general
expression
refined
inner
spiritual
labor
but
now
was
quite
differently
lit
there
was
pathetic
expression
sorrow
prayer
and
hope
had
occurred
before
when
she
was
present
nicholas
went
her
without
waiting
prompted
the
governor
wife
and
not
asking
himself
whether
not
was
right
and
proper
address
her
here
church
and
told
her
had
heard
her
trouble
and
sympathized
with
his
whole
soul
soon
she
heard
his
voice
vivid
glow
kindled
her
face
lighting
both
her
sorrow
and
her
joy
there
one
thing
wanted
tell
you
princess
said
rostov
that
your
brother
prince
andrew
nikolievich
were
not
living
would
have
been
once
announced
the
gazette
colonel
the
princess
looked
him
not
grasping
what
was
saying
but
cheered
the
expression
regretful
sympathy
his
face
and
have
known
many
cases
splinter
wound
the
gazette
said
was
shell
either
proving
fatal
once
being
very
slight
continued
nicholas
must
hope
for
the
best
and
sure
princess
mary
interrupted
him
that
would
dread
she
began
and
prevented
agitation
from
finishing
she
bent
her
head
with
movement
graceful
everything
she
did
his
presence
and
looking
him
gratefully
went
out
following
her
aunt
that
evening
nicholas
did
not
out
but
stayed
home
settle
some
accounts
with
the
horse
dealers
when
had
finished
that
business
was
already
too
late
anywhere
but
still
too
early
bed
and
for
long
time
paced
and
down
the
room
reflecting
his
life
thing
rarely
did
princess
mary
had
made
agreeable
impression
him
when
had
met
her
smolensk
province
his
having
encountered
her
such
exceptional
circumstances
and
his
mother
having
one
time
mentioned
her
him
good
match
had
drawn
his
particular
attention
her
when
met
her
again
voronezh
the
impression
she
made
him
was
not
merely
pleasing
but
powerful
nicholas
had
been
struck
the
peculiar
moral
beauty
observed
her
this
time
was
however
preparing
away
and
had
not
entered
his
head
regret
that
was
thus
depriving
himself
chances
meeting
her
but
that
day
encounter
church
had
felt
sunk
deeper
than
was
desirable
for
his
peace
mind
that
pale
sad
refined
face
that
radiant
look
those
gentle
graceful
gestures
and
especially
the
deep
and
tender
sorrow
expressed
all
her
features
agitated
him
and
evoked
his
sympathy
men
rostov
could
not
bear
see
the
expression
higher
spiritual
life
that
was
why
did
not
like
prince
andrew
and
referred
contemptuously
philosophy
and
dreaminess
but
princess
mary
that
very
sorrow
which
revealed
the
depth
whole
spiritual
world
foreign
him
was
irresistible
attraction
she
must
wonderful
woman
real
angel
said
himself
why
not
free
why
was
such
hurry
with
sonya
and
involuntarily
compared
the
two
the
lack
spirituality
the
one
and
the
abundance
the
other
spirituality
himself
lacked
and
therefore
valued
most
highly
tried
picture
what
would
happen
were
free
how
would
propose
her
and
how
she
would
become
his
wife
but
could
not
imagine
that
felt
awed
and
clear
picture
presented
itself
his
mind
had
long
ago
pictured
himself
future
with
sonya
and
that
was
all
clear
and
simple
just
because
had
all
been
thought
out
and
knew
all
there
was
sonya
but
was
impossible
picture
future
with
princess
mary
because
did
not
understand
her
but
simply
loved
her
reveries
about
sonya
had
had
something
merry
and
playful
them
but
dream
princess
mary
was
always
difficult
and
little
frightening
how
she
prayed
thought
was
plain
that
her
whole
soul
was
her
prayer
yes
that
was
the
prayer
that
moves
mountains
and
sure
her
prayer
will
answered
why
don
pray
for
what
want
suddenly
thought
what
want
free
released
from
sonya
she
was
right
thought
remembering
what
the
governor
wife
had
said
nothing
but
misfortune
can
come
marrying
sonya
muddles
grief
for
mamma
business
difficulties
muddles
terrible
muddles
besides
don
love
her
not
should
god
release
from
this
dreadful
inextricable
position
suddenly
began
pray
yes
prayer
can
move
mountains
but
one
must
have
faith
and
not
pray
natasha
and
used
children
that
the
snow
might
turn
into
sugar
and
then
run
out
into
the
yard
see
whether
had
done
but
not
praying
for
trifles
now
thought
put
his
pipe
down
corner
and
folding
his
hands
placed
himself
before
the
icon
softened
memories
princess
mary
began
pray
had
not
done
for
long
time
tears
were
his
eyes
and
his
throat
when
the
door
opened
and
lavrushka
came
with
some
papers
blockhead
why
you
come
without
being
called
cried
nicholas
quickly
changing
his
attitude
from
the
governor
said
lavrushka
sleepy
voice
courier
has
arrived
and
there
letter
for
you
well
all
right
thanks
you
can
nicholas
took
the
two
letters
one
which
was
from
his
mother
and
the
other
from
sonya
recognized
them
the
handwriting
and
opened
sonya
first
had
read
only
few
lines
when
turned
pale
and
his
eyes
opened
wide
with
fear
and
joy
not
possible
cried
aloud
unable
sit
still
paced
and
down
the
room
holding
the
letter
and
reading
glanced
through
then
read
again
and
then
again
and
standing
still
the
middle
the
room
raised
his
shoulders
stretching
out
his
hands
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
his
eyes
fixed
what
had
just
been
praying
for
with
confidence
that
god
would
hear
him
had
come
pass
but
nicholas
was
much
astonished
were
something
extraordinary
and
unexpected
and
the
very
fact
that
had
happened
quickly
proved
that
had
not
come
from
god
whom
had
prayed
but
some
ordinary
coincidence
this
unexpected
and
seemed
nicholas
quite
voluntary
letter
from
sonya
freed
him
from
the
knot
that
fettered
him
and
from
which
there
had
seemed
escape
she
wrote
that
the
last
unfortunate
events
the
loss
almost
the
whole
the
rostovs
moscow
property
and
the
countess
repeatedly
expressed
wish
that
nicholas
should
marry
princess
bolkonskaya
together
with
his
silence
and
coldness
late
had
all
combined
make
her
decide
release
him
from
his
promise
and
set
him
completely
free
would
too
painful
think
that
might
cause
sorrow
discord
the
family
that
has
been
good
she
wrote
and
love
has
aim
but
the
happiness
those
love
nicholas
beg
you
consider
yourself
free
and
assured
that
spite
everything
one
can
love
you
more
than
does
your
sonya
both
letters
were
written
from
troitsa
the
other
from
the
countess
described
their
last
days
moscow
their
departure
the
fire
and
the
destruction
all
their
property
this
letter
the
countess
also
mentioned
that
prince
andrew
was
among
the
wounded
traveling
with
them
his
state
was
very
critical
but
the
doctor
said
there
was
now
more
hope
sonya
and
natasha
were
nursing
him
next
day
nicholas
took
his
mother
letter
and
went
see
princess
mary
neither
nor
she
said
word
about
what
natasha
nursing
him
might
mean
but
thanks
this
letter
nicholas
suddenly
became
almost
intimate
with
the
princess
they
were
relations
the
following
day
saw
princess
mary
off
her
journey
yaroslavl
and
few
days
later
left
rejoin
his
regiment
chapter
viii
sonya
letter
written
from
troitsa
which
had
come
answer
nicholas
prayer
was
prompted
this
the
thought
getting
nicholas
married
heiress
occupied
the
old
countess
mind
more
and
more
she
knew
that
sonya
was
the
chief
obstacle
this
happening
and
sonya
life
the
countess
house
had
grown
harder
and
harder
especially
after
they
had
received
letter
from
nicholas
telling
his
meeting
with
princess
mary
bogucharovo
the
countess
let
occasion
slip
making
humiliating
cruel
allusions
sonya
but
few
days
before
they
left
moscow
moved
and
excited
all
that
was
going
she
called
sonya
her
and
instead
reproaching
and
making
demands
her
tearfully
implored
her
sacrifice
herself
and
repay
all
that
the
family
had
done
for
her
breaking
off
her
engagement
with
nicholas
shall
not
peace
till
you
promise
this
sonya
burst
into
hysterical
tears
and
replied
through
her
sobs
that
she
would
anything
and
was
prepared
for
anything
but
gave
actual
promise
and
could
not
bring
herself
decide
what
was
demanded
her
she
must
sacrifice
herself
for
the
family
that
had
reared
and
brought
her
sacrifice
herself
for
others
was
sonya
habit
her
position
the
house
was
such
that
only
sacrifice
could
she
show
her
worth
and
she
was
accustomed
this
and
loved
doing
but
all
her
former
acts
self
sacrifice
she
had
been
happily
conscious
that
they
raised
her
her
own
esteem
and
that
others
and
made
her
more
worthy
nicholas
whom
she
loved
more
than
anything
the
world
but
now
they
wanted
her
sacrifice
the
very
thing
that
constituted
the
whole
reward
for
her
self
sacrifice
and
the
whole
meaning
her
life
and
for
the
first
time
she
felt
bitterness
against
those
who
had
been
her
benefactors
only
torture
her
the
more
painfully
she
felt
jealous
natasha
who
had
never
experienced
anything
this
sort
had
never
needed
sacrifice
herself
but
made
others
sacrifice
themselves
for
her
and
yet
was
beloved
everybody
and
for
the
first
time
sonya
felt
that
out
her
pure
quiet
love
for
nicholas
passionate
feeling
was
beginning
grow
which
was
stronger
than
principle
virtue
religion
under
the
influence
this
feeling
sonya
whose
life
dependence
had
taught
her
involuntarily
secretive
having
answered
the
countess
vague
general
terms
avoided
talking
with
her
and
resolved
wait
till
she
should
see
nicholas
not
order
set
him
free
but
the
contrary
that
meeting
bind
him
her
forever
the
bustle
and
terror
the
rostovs
last
days
moscow
stifled
the
gloomy
thoughts
that
oppressed
sonya
she
was
glad
find
escape
from
them
practical
activity
but
when
she
heard
prince
andrew
presence
their
house
despite
her
sincere
pity
for
him
and
for
natasha
she
was
seized
joyful
and
superstitious
feeling
that
god
did
not
intend
her
separated
from
nicholas
she
knew
that
natasha
loved
one
but
prince
andrew
and
had
never
ceased
love
him
she
knew
that
being
thrown
together
again
under
such
terrible
circumstances
they
would
again
fall
love
with
one
another
and
that
nicholas
would
then
not
able
marry
princess
mary
they
would
within
the
prohibited
degrees
affinity
despite
all
the
terror
what
had
happened
during
those
last
days
and
during
the
first
days
their
journey
this
feeling
that
providence
was
intervening
her
personal
affairs
cheered
sonya
the
troitsa
monastery
the
rostovs
first
broke
their
journey
for
whole
day
three
large
rooms
were
assigned
them
the
monastery
hostelry
one
which
was
occupied
prince
andrew
the
wounded
man
was
much
better
that
day
and
natasha
was
sitting
with
him
the
next
room
sat
the
count
and
countess
respectfully
conversing
with
the
prior
who
was
calling
them
old
acquaintances
and
benefactors
the
monastery
sonya
was
there
too
tormented
curiosity
what
prince
andrew
and
natasha
were
talking
about
she
heard
the
sound
their
voices
through
the
door
that
door
opened
and
natasha
came
out
looking
excited
not
noticing
the
monk
who
had
risen
greet
her
and
was
drawing
back
the
wide
sleeve
his
right
arm
she
went
sonya
and
took
her
hand
natasha
what
are
you
about
come
here
said
the
countess
natasha
went
the
monk
for
his
blessing
and
advised
her
pray
for
aid
god
and
his
saint
soon
the
prior
withdrew
natasha
took
her
friend
the
hand
and
went
with
her
into
the
unoccupied
room
sonya
will
live
she
asked
sonya
how
happy
and
how
unhappy
sonya
dovey
everything
used
only
lives
cannot
because
because
and
natasha
burst
into
tears
yes
knew
thank
god
murmured
sonya
will
live
sonya
was
not
less
agitated
than
her
friend
the
latter
fear
and
grief
and
her
own
personal
feelings
which
she
shared
with
one
sobbing
she
kissed
and
comforted
natasha
only
lives
she
thought
having
wept
talked
and
wiped
away
their
tears
the
two
friends
went
together
prince
andrew
door
natasha
opened
cautiously
and
glanced
into
the
room
sonya
standing
beside
her
the
half
open
door
prince
andrew
was
lying
raised
high
three
pillows
his
pale
face
was
calm
his
eyes
closed
and
they
could
see
his
regular
breathing
natasha
sonya
suddenly
almost
screamed
catching
her
companion
arm
and
stepping
back
from
the
door
what
what
asked
natasha
that
that
said
sonya
with
white
face
and
trembling
lips
natasha
softly
closed
the
door
and
went
with
sonya
the
window
not
yet
understanding
what
the
latter
was
telling
her
you
remember
said
sonya
with
solemn
and
frightened
expression
you
remember
when
looked
the
mirror
for
you
otradnoe
christmas
you
remember
what
saw
yes
yes
cried
natasha
opening
her
eyes
wide
and
vaguely
recalling
that
sonya
had
told
her
something
about
prince
andrew
whom
she
had
seen
lying
down
you
remember
sonya
went
saw
then
and
told
everybody
you
and
dunyasha
saw
him
lying
bed
said
she
making
gesture
with
her
hand
and
lifted
finger
each
detail
and
that
had
his
eyes
closed
and
was
covered
just
with
pink
quilt
and
that
his
hands
were
folded
she
concluded
convincing
herself
that
the
details
she
had
just
seen
were
exactly
what
she
had
seen
the
mirror
she
had
fact
seen
nothing
then
but
had
mentioned
the
first
thing
that
came
into
her
head
but
what
she
had
invented
then
seemed
her
now
real
any
other
recollection
she
not
only
remembered
what
she
had
then
said
that
turned
look
her
and
smiled
and
was
covered
with
something
red
but
was
firmly
convinced
that
she
had
then
seen
and
said
that
was
covered
with
pink
quilt
and
that
his
eyes
were
closed
yes
yes
really
was
pink
cried
natasha
who
now
thought
she
too
remembered
the
word
pink
being
used
and
saw
this
the
most
extraordinary
and
mysterious
part
the
prediction
but
what
does
mean
she
added
meditatively
don
know
all
strange
replied
sonya
clutching
her
head
few
minutes
later
prince
andrew
rang
and
natasha
went
him
but
sonya
feeling
unusually
excited
and
touched
remained
the
window
thinking
about
the
strangeness
what
had
occurred
they
had
opportunity
that
day
send
letters
the
army
and
the
countess
was
writing
her
son
sonya
said
the
countess
raising
her
eyes
from
her
letter
her
niece
passed
sonya
won
you
write
nicholas
she
spoke
soft
tremulous
voice
and
the
weary
eyes
that
looked
over
her
spectacles
sonya
read
all
that
the
countess
meant
convey
with
these
words
those
eyes
expressed
entreaty
shame
having
ask
fear
refusal
and
readiness
for
relentless
hatred
case
such
refusal
sonya
went
the
countess
and
kneeling
down
kissed
her
hand
yes
mamma
will
write
said
she
sonya
was
softened
excited
and
touched
all
that
had
occurred
that
day
especially
the
mysterious
fulfillment
she
had
just
seen
her
vision
now
that
she
knew
that
the
renewal
natasha
relations
with
prince
andrew
would
prevent
nicholas
from
marrying
princess
mary
she
was
joyfully
conscious
return
that
self
sacrificing
spirit
which
she
was
accustomed
live
and
loved
live
with
joyful
consciousness
performing
magnanimous
deed
interrupted
several
times
the
tears
that
dimmed
her
velvety
black
eyes
she
wrote
that
touching
letter
the
arrival
which
had
amazed
nicholas
chapter
the
officer
and
soldiers
who
had
arrested
pierre
treated
him
with
hostility
but
yet
with
respect
the
guardhouse
which
was
taken
their
attitude
toward
him
could
still
felt
both
uncertainty
who
might
perhaps
very
important
person
and
hostility
result
their
recent
personal
conflict
with
him
but
when
the
guard
was
relieved
next
morning
pierre
felt
that
for
the
new
guard
both
officers
and
men
was
not
interesting
had
been
his
captors
and
fact
the
guard
the
second
day
did
not
recognize
this
big
stout
man
peasant
coat
the
vigorous
person
who
had
fought
desperately
with
the
marauder
and
the
convoy
and
had
uttered
those
solemn
words
about
saving
child
they
saw
him
only
the
captured
russians
arrested
and
detained
for
some
reason
order
the
higher
command
they
noticed
anything
remarkable
about
pierre
was
only
his
unabashed
meditative
concentration
and
thoughtfulness
and
the
way
spoke
french
which
struck
them
surprisingly
good
spite
this
was
placed
that
day
with
the
other
arrested
suspects
the
separate
room
had
occupied
was
required
officer
all
the
russians
confined
with
pierre
were
men
the
lowest
class
and
recognizing
him
gentleman
they
all
avoided
him
more
especially
spoke
french
pierre
felt
sad
hearing
them
making
fun
him
that
evening
learned
that
all
these
prisoners
probably
among
them
were
tried
for
incendiarism
the
third
day
was
taken
with
the
others
house
where
french
general
with
white
mustache
sat
with
two
colonels
and
other
frenchmen
with
scarves
their
arms
with
the
precision
and
definiteness
customary
addressing
prisoners
and
which
supposed
preclude
human
frailty
pierre
like
the
others
was
questioned
who
was
where
had
been
with
what
object
and
these
questions
like
questions
put
trials
generally
left
the
essence
the
matter
aside
shut
out
the
possibility
that
essence
being
revealed
and
were
designed
only
form
channel
through
which
the
judges
wished
the
answers
the
accused
flow
lead
the
desired
result
namely
conviction
soon
pierre
began
say
anything
that
did
not
fit
with
that
aim
the
channel
was
removed
and
the
water
could
flow
waste
pierre
felt
moreover
what
the
accused
always
feel
their
trial
perplexity
why
these
questions
were
put
him
had
feeling
that
was
only
out
condescension
kind
civility
that
this
device
placing
channel
was
employed
knew
was
these
men
power
that
only
force
had
they
brought
him
there
that
force
alone
gave
them
the
right
demand
answers
their
questions
and
that
the
sole
object
that
assembly
was
inculpate
him
and
they
had
the
power
and
wish
inculpate
him
this
expedient
inquiry
and
trial
seemed
unnecessary
was
evident
that
any
answer
would
lead
conviction
when
asked
what
was
doing
when
was
arrested
pierre
replied
rather
tragic
manner
that
was
restoring
its
parents
child
had
saved
from
the
flames
why
had
fought
the
marauder
pierre
answered
that
was
protecting
woman
and
that
protect
woman
who
was
being
insulted
was
the
duty
every
man
that
they
interrupted
him
for
this
was
not
the
point
why
was
the
yard
burning
house
where
witnesses
had
seen
him
replied
that
had
gone
out
see
what
was
happening
moscow
again
they
interrupted
him
they
had
not
asked
where
was
going
but
why
was
found
near
the
fire
who
was
they
asked
repeating
their
first
question
which
had
declined
answer
again
replied
that
could
not
answer
put
that
down
that
bad
very
bad
sternly
remarked
the
general
with
the
white
mustache
and
red
flushed
face
the
fourth
day
fires
broke
out
the
zubovski
rampart
pierre
and
thirteen
others
were
moved
the
coach
house
merchant
house
near
the
crimean
bridge
his
way
through
the
streets
pierre
felt
stifled
the
smoke
which
seemed
hang
over
the
whole
city
fires
were
visible
all
sides
did
not
then
realize
the
significance
the
burning
moscow
and
looked
the
fires
with
horror
passed
four
days
the
coach
house
near
the
crimean
bridge
and
during
that
time
learned
from
the
talk
the
french
soldiers
that
all
those
confined
there
were
awaiting
decision
which
might
come
any
day
from
the
marshal
what
marshal
this
was
pierre
could
not
learn
from
the
soldiers
evidently
for
them
the
marshal
represented
very
high
and
rather
mysterious
power
these
first
days
before
the
eighth
september
when
the
prisoners
were
had
for
second
examination
were
the
hardest
all
for
pierre
chapter
the
eighth
september
officer
very
important
one
judging
the
respect
the
guards
showed
him
entered
the
coach
house
where
the
prisoners
were
this
officer
probably
someone
the
staff
was
holding
paper
his
hand
and
called
over
all
the
russians
there
naming
pierre
the
man
who
does
not
give
his
name
glancing
indolently
and
indifferently
all
the
prisoners
ordered
the
officer
charge
have
them
decently
dressed
and
tidied
before
taking
them
the
marshal
hour
later
squad
soldiers
arrived
and
pierre
with
thirteen
others
was
led
the
virgin
field
was
fine
day
sunny
after
rain
and
the
air
was
unusually
pure
the
smoke
did
not
hang
low
the
day
when
pierre
had
been
taken
from
the
guardhouse
the
zubovski
rampart
but
rose
through
the
pure
air
columns
flames
were
seen
but
columns
smoke
rose
all
sides
and
all
moscow
far
pierre
could
see
was
one
vast
charred
ruin
all
sides
there
were
waste
spaces
with
only
stoves
and
chimney
stacks
still
standing
and
here
and
there
the
blackened
walls
some
brick
houses
pierre
gazed
the
ruins
and
did
not
recognize
districts
had
known
well
here
and
there
could
see
churches
that
had
not
been
burned
the
kremlin
which
was
not
destroyed
gleamed
white
the
distance
with
its
towers
and
the
belfry
ivan
the
great
the
domes
the
new
convent
the
virgin
glittered
brightly
and
its
bells
were
ringing
particularly
clearly
these
bells
reminded
pierre
that
was
sunday
and
the
feast
the
nativity
the
virgin
but
there
seemed
one
celebrate
this
holiday
everywhere
were
blackened
ruins
and
the
few
russians
seen
were
tattered
and
frightened
people
who
tried
hide
when
they
saw
the
french
was
plain
that
the
russian
nest
was
ruined
and
destroyed
but
place
the
russian
order
life
that
had
been
destroyed
pierre
unconsciously
felt
that
quite
different
firm
french
order
had
been
established
over
this
ruined
nest
felt
this
the
looks
the
soldiers
who
marching
regular
ranks
briskly
and
gaily
were
escorting
him
and
the
other
criminals
felt
the
looks
important
french
official
carriage
and
pair
driven
soldier
whom
they
met
the
way
felt
the
merry
sounds
regimental
music
heard
from
the
left
side
the
field
and
felt
and
realized
especially
from
the
list
prisoners
the
french
officer
had
read
out
when
came
that
morning
pierre
had
been
taken
one
set
soldiers
and
led
first
one
and
then
another
place
with
dozens
other
men
and
seemed
that
they
might
have
forgotten
him
confused
him
with
the
others
but
the
answers
had
given
when
questioned
had
come
back
him
his
designation
the
man
who
does
not
give
his
name
and
under
that
appellation
which
pierre
seemed
terrible
they
were
now
leading
him
somewhere
with
unhesitating
assurance
their
faces
that
and
all
the
other
prisoners
were
exactly
the
ones
they
wanted
and
that
they
were
being
taken
the
proper
place
pierre
felt
himself
insignificant
chip
fallen
among
the
wheels
machine
whose
action
did
not
understand
but
which
was
working
well
and
the
other
prisoners
were
taken
the
right
side
the
virgin
field
large
white
house
with
immense
garden
not
far
from
the
convent
this
was
prince
shcherbitov
house
where
pierre
had
often
been
other
days
and
which
learned
from
the
talk
the
soldiers
was
now
occupied
the
marshal
the
duke
eckmuhl
davout
they
were
taken
the
entrance
and
led
into
the
house
one
one
pierre
was
the
sixth
enter
was
conducted
through
glass
gallery
anteroom
and
hall
which
were
familiar
him
into
long
low
study
the
door
which
stood
adjutant
davout
spectacles
nose
sat
bent
over
table
the
further
end
the
room
pierre
went
close
him
but
davout
evidently
consulting
paper
that
lay
before
him
did
not
look
without
raising
his
eyes
said
low
voice
who
are
you
pierre
was
silent
because
was
incapable
uttering
word
him
davout
was
not
merely
french
general
but
man
notorious
for
his
cruelty
looking
his
cold
face
sat
like
stern
schoolmaster
who
was
prepared
wait
awhile
for
answer
pierre
felt
that
every
instant
delay
might
cost
him
his
life
but
did
not
know
what
say
did
not
venture
repeat
what
had
said
his
first
examination
yet
disclose
his
rank
and
position
was
dangerous
and
embarrassing
was
silent
but
before
had
decided
what
davout
raised
his
head
pushed
his
spectacles
back
his
forehead
screwed
his
eyes
and
looked
intently
him
know
that
man
said
cold
measured
tone
evidently
calculated
frighten
pierre
the
chill
that
had
been
running
down
pierre
back
now
seized
his
head
vise
you
cannot
know
general
have
never
seen
you
russian
spy
davout
interrupted
addressing
another
general
who
was
present
but
whom
pierre
had
not
noticed
davout
turned
away
with
unexpected
reverberation
his
voice
pierre
rapidly
began
monseigneur
said
suddenly
remembering
that
davout
was
duke
monseigneur
you
cannot
have
known
militia
officer
and
have
not
quitted
moscow
your
name
asked
davout
bezukhov
what
proof
have
that
you
are
not
lying
monseigneur
exclaimed
pierre
not
offended
but
pleading
voice
davout
looked
and
gazed
intently
him
for
some
seconds
they
looked
one
another
and
that
look
saved
pierre
apart
from
conditions
war
and
law
that
look
established
human
relations
between
the
two
men
that
moment
immense
number
things
passed
dimly
through
both
their
minds
and
they
realized
that
they
were
both
children
humanity
and
were
brothers
the
first
glance
when
davout
had
only
raised
his
head
from
the
papers
where
human
affairs
and
lives
were
indicated
numbers
pierre
was
merely
circumstance
and
davout
could
have
shot
him
without
burdening
his
conscience
with
evil
deed
but
now
saw
him
human
being
reflected
for
moment
how
can
you
show
that
you
are
telling
the
truth
said
davout
coldly
pierre
remembered
ramballe
and
named
him
and
his
regiment
and
the
street
where
the
house
was
you
are
not
what
you
say
returned
davout
trembling
faltering

pierre
began
adducing
proofs
the
truth
his
statements
but
that
moment
adjutant
entered
and
reported
something
davout
davout
brightened
the
news
the
adjutant
brought
and
began
buttoning
his
uniform
seemed
that
had
quite
forgotten
pierre
when
the
adjutant
reminded
him
the
prisoner
jerked
his
head
pierre
direction
with
frown
and
ordered
him
led
away
but
where
they
were
take
him
pierre
did
not
know

his
companions
had
pointed
out
him
they
crossed
the

turned
his
head
and
saw
that
the
adjutant
was
putting
another
question
davout
yes
course
replied
davout
but
what
this
yes
meant
pierre
did
not
know
pierre
could
not
afterwards
remember
how
went
whether
was
far
which
direction
his
faculties
were
quite
numbed
was
stupefied
and
noticing
nothing
around
him
went
moving
his
legs
the
others
did
till
they
all
stopped
and
stopped
too
the
only
thought
his
mind
that
time
was
who
was
that
had
really
sentenced
him
death
not
the
men
the
commission
that
had
first
examined
him
not

could
have
done
was
not
davout
who
had
looked
him
human
way
another
moment
davout
would
have
realized
that
was
doing
wrong
but
just
then
the
adjutant
had
come
and
interrupted
him
the
adjutant
also
had
evidently
had
evil
intent
though
might
have
refrained
from
coming
then
who
was
executing
him
killing
him
depriving
him
life
him
pierre
with
all
his
memories
aspirations
hopes
and
thoughts
who
was
doing
this
and
pierre
felt
that
was
one
was
system
concurrence
circumstances
system
some
sort
was
killing
him

depriving
him

everything
annihilating
him

near

the

were
placed
certain
order
according
the
list
pierre
was
sixth
and
were
led
the
post
several
drums
suddenly
began
beat
both
sides
them
and
that
sound
pierre
felt
part
his
soul
had
been
torn
away
lost
the
power
thinking
understanding
could
only
hear
and
see
and
had
only
one
wish
that
the
frightful
thing
that
had
happen
should
happen
quickly
pierre
looked
round
his
fellow
prisoners
and
scrutinized
them
the
two
first
were
convicts
with
shaven
heads
one
was
tall
and
thin
the
other
dark
shaggy
and
sinewy
with
flat
nose
the
third
was
domestic

about
forty
five
years
old
with
grizzled
hair
and
plump

was

replied
the

calm
voice
there
was
stir
the
ranks
the
soldiers
and
was
evident
that
they
were
all
hurrying
not
men
hurry
something
they
understand
but
people
hurry
finish
necessary
but
unpleasant
and
incomprehensible
task
french
official
wearing

came
the
right
the
row
prisoners
and
read
out
the
sentence
russian
and
french
then
two
pairs
frenchmen
approached
the
criminals
and
the
officer
command
took
the
two
convicts
who
stood
first
the
row
the
convicts
stopped
when
they
reached
the
post
and
while
sacks
were
being
brought
looked
dumbly
around
wounded
beast
looks
approaching
huntsman
one
crossed
himself
continually
the
other
scratched
his
back
and
made
movement
the
lips
resembling
smile
with
hurried
hands
the
soldiers
blindfolded
them
drawing
the
sacks
over
their
heads
and
bound
them
the
post
twelve
sharpshooters
with
muskets
stepped
out
the
ranks
with
firm
regular
tread
and
halted
eight
paces
from
the
post
pierre
turned
away
avoid
seeing
what
was
going
happen
suddenly
crackling
rolling
noise
was
heard
which
seemed
him
louder
than
the
most
terrific
thunder
and
looked
round
there
was
some
smoke
and
the
frenchmen
were
doing
something
near
the
pit
with
pale
faces
and
trembling
hands
two
more
prisoners
were
led
the
same
way
and
with
similar
looks
these
two
glanced
vainly
the
onlookers
with
only
silent
appeal
for
protection
their
eyes
evidently
unable
understand
believe
what
was
going
happen
them
they
could
not
believe
because
they
alone
knew
what
their
life
meant
them
and
they
neither
understood
nor
believed
that
could
taken
from
them
again
pierre
did
not
wish
look
and
again
turned
away
but
again
the
sound
frightful
explosion
struck
his
ear
and
the
same
moment
saw
smoke
blood
and
the
pale
scared
faces
the
frenchmen
who
were
again
doing
something
the
post
their
trembling
hands
impeding
one
another
pierre
breathing
heavily
looked
around
asking
what
meant
the
same
question
was
expressed
all
the
looks
that
met
his
the
faces
all
the
russians
and
the
french
soldiers
and
officers
without
exception
read
the
same
dismay
horror
and
conflict
that
were
his
own
heart
but
who
after
all
doing
this
they
are
all
suffering
who
then
who
flashed
for
instant
through
his
mind
sharpshooters
the
forward
shouted
someone
the
fifth
prisoner
the
one
next
pierre
was
led
away
alone
pierre
did
not
understand
that
was
saved
that
and
the
rest
had
been
brought
there
only
witness
the
execution
with
ever
growing
horror
and
sense
joy
relief
gazed
what
was
taking
place
the
fifth
man
was
the
factory
lad
the
loose
cloak
the
moment
they
laid
hands
him
sprang
aside
terror
and
clutched
pierre
pierre
shuddered
and
shook
himself
free
the
lad
was
unable
walk
they
dragged
him
along
holding
him
under
the
arms
and
screamed
when
they
got
him
the
post
grew
quiet
suddenly
understood
something
whether
understood
that
screaming
was
useless
whether
thought
incredible
that
men
should
kill
him
any
rate
took
his
stand
the
post
waiting
blindfolded
like
the
others
and
like
wounded
animal
looked
around
him
with
glittering
eyes
pierre
was
longer
able
turn
away
and
close
his
eyes
his
curiosity
and
agitation
like
that
the
whole
crowd
reached
the
highest
pitch
this
fifth
murder
like
the
others
this
fifth
man
seemed
calm
wrapped
his
loose
cloak
closer
and
rubbed
one
bare
foot
with
the
other
when
they
began
blindfold
him
himself
adjusted
the
knot
which
hurt
the
back
his
head
then
when
they
propped
him
against
the
bloodstained
post
leaned
back
and
not
being
comfortable
that
position
straightened
himself
adjusted
his
feet
and
leaned
back
again
more
comfortably
pierre
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
him
and
did
not
miss
his
slightest
movement
probably
word
command
was
given
and
was
followed
the
reports
eight
muskets
but
try
would
pierre
could
not
afterwards
remember
having
heard
the
slightest
sound
the
shots
only
saw
how
the
workman
suddenly
sank
down
the
cords
that
held
him
how
blood
showed
itself
two
places
how
the
ropes
slackened
under
the
weight
the
hanging
body
and
how
the
workman
sat
down
his
head
hanging
unnaturally
and
one
leg
bent
under
him
pierre
ran
the
post
one
hindered
him
pale
frightened
people
were
doing
something
around
the
workman
the
lower
jaw
old
frenchman
with
thick
mustache
trembled
untied
the
ropes
the
body
collapsed
the
soldiers
dragged
awkwardly
from
the
post
and
began
pushing
into
the
pit
they
all
plainly
and
certainly
knew
that
they
were
criminals
who
must
hide
the
traces
their
guilt
quickly
possible
pierre
glanced
into
the
pit
and
saw
that
the
factory
lad
was
lying
with
his
knees
close
his
head
and
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
that
shoulder
rose
and
fell
rhythmically
and
convulsively
but
spadefuls
earth
were
already
being
thrown
over
the
whole
body
one
the
soldiers
evidently
suffering
shouted
gruffly
and
angrily
pierre
back
but
pierre
did
not
understand
him
and
remained
near
the
post
and
one
drove
him
away
when
the
pit
had
been
filled
command
was
given
pierre
was
taken
back
his
place
and
the
rows
troops
both
sides
the
post
made
half
turn
and
went
past
measured
pace
the
twenty
four
sharpshooters
with
discharged
muskets
standing
the
center
the
circle
ran
back
their
places
the
companies
passed
pierre
gazed
now
with
dazed
eyes
these
sharpshooters
who
ran
couples
out
the
circle
all
but
one
rejoined
their
companies
this
one
young
soldier
his
face
deadly
pale
his
shako
pushed
back
and
his
musket
resting
the
ground
still
stood
near
the
pit
the
spot
from
which
had
fired
swayed
like
drunken
man
taking
some
steps
forward
and
back
save
himself
from
falling
old
noncommissioned
officer
ran
out
the
ranks
and
taking
him
the
elbow
dragged
him
his
company
the
crowd
russians
and
frenchmen
began
disperse
they
all
went
away
silently
and
with
drooping
heads
that
will
teach
them
start
fires
said
one
the
frenchmen
pierre
glanced
round
the
speaker
and
saw
that
was
soldier
who
was
trying
find
some
relief
after
what
had
been
done
but
was
not
able
without
finishing
what
had
begun
say
made
hopeless
movement
with
his
arm
and
went
away
chapter
xii
after
the
execution
pierre
was
separated
from
the
rest
the
prisoners
and
placed
alone
small
ruined
and
befouled
church
toward
evening
noncommissioned
officer
entered
with
two
soldiers
and
told
him
that
had
been
pardoned
and
would
now
the
barracks
for
the
prisoners
war
without
understanding
what
was
said
him
pierre
got
and
went
with
the
soldiers
they
took
him
the
upper
end
the
field
where
there
were
some
sheds
built
charred
planks
beams
and
battens
and
led
him
into
one
them
the
darkness
some
twenty
different
men
surrounded
pierre
looked
them
without
understanding
who
they
were
why
they
were
there
what
they
wanted
him
heard
what
they
said
but
did
not
understand
the
meaning
the
words
and
made
kind
deduction
from
application
them
replied
questions
they
put
him
but
did
not
consider
who
was
listening
his
replies
nor
how
they
would
understand
them
looked
their
faces
and
figures
but
they
all
seemed
him
equally
meaningless
from
the
moment
pierre
had
witnessed
those
terrible
murders
committed
men
who
did
not
wish
commit
them
was
the
mainspring
his
life
which
everything
depended
and
which
made
everything
appear
alive
had
suddenly
been
wrenched
out
and
everything
had
collapsed
into
heap
meaningless
rubbish
though
did
not
acknowledge
himself
his
faith
the
right
ordering
the
universe
humanity
his
own
soul
and
god
had
been
destroyed
had
experienced
this
before
but
never
strongly
now
when
similar
doubts
had
assailed
him
before
they
had
been
the
result
his
own
wrongdoing
and
the
bottom
his
heart
had
felt
that
relief
from
his
despair
and
from
those
doubts
was
found
within
himself
but
now
felt
that
the
universe
had
crumbled
before
his
eyes
and
only
meaningless
ruins
remained
and
this
not
any
fault
his
own
felt
that
was
not
his
power
regain
faith
the
meaning
life
around
him
the
darkness
men
were
standing
and
evidently
something
about
him
interested
them
greatly
they
were
telling
him
something
and
asking
him
something
then
they
led
him
away
somewhere
and
last
found
himself
corner
the
shed
among
men
who
were
laughing
and
talking
all
sides
well
then
mates
that
very
prince
who
some
voice
the
other
end
the
shed
was
saying
with
strong
emphasis
the
word
who
sitting
silent
and
motionless
heap
straw
against
the
wall
pierre
sometimes
opened
and
sometimes
closed
his
eyes
but
soon
closed
them
saw
before
him
the
dreadful
face
the
factory
lad
especially
dreadful
because
its
simplicity
and
the
faces
the
murderers
even
more
dreadful
because
their
disquiet
and
opened
his
eyes
again
and
stared
vacantly
into
the
darkness
around
him
beside
him
stooping
position
sat
small
man
whose
presence
was
first
made
aware
strong
smell
perspiration
which
came
from
him
every
time
moved
this
man
was
doing
something
his
legs
the
darkness
and
though
pierre
could
not
see
his
face
felt
that
the
man
continually
glanced
him
growing
used
the
darkness
pierre
saw
that
the
man
was
taking
off
his
leg
bands
and
the
way
did
aroused
pierre
interest
having
unwound
the
string
that
tied
the
band
one
leg
carefully
coiled
and
immediately
set
work
the
other
leg
glancing
pierre
while
one
hand
hung
the
first
string
the
other
was
already
unwinding
the
band
the
second
leg
this
way
having
carefully
removed
the
leg
bands
deft
circular
motions
his
arm
following
one
another
uninterruptedly
the
man
hung
the
leg
bands
some
pegs
fixed
above
his
head
then
took
out
knife
cut
something
closed
the
knife
placed
under
the
head
his
bed
and
seating
himself
comfortably
clasped
his
arms
round
his
lifted
knees
and
fixed
his
eyes
pierre
the
latter
was
conscious
something
pleasant
comforting
and
well
rounded
these
deft
movements
the
man
well
ordered
arrangements
his
corner
and
even
his
very
smell
and
looked
the
man
without
taking
his
eyes
from
him
you
seen
lot
trouble
sir
the
little
man
suddenly
said
and
there
was
much
kindliness
and
simplicity
his
singsong
voice
that
pierre
tried
reply
but
his
jaw
trembled
and
felt
tears
rising
his
eyes
the
little
fellow
giving
pierre
time
betray
his
confusion
instantly
continued
the
same
pleasant
tones

said
and
still
speaking
turned
his
knees
with
supple
movement
got
coughed
and
went
off
another
part
the
shed
you
rascal
pierre
heard
the
same
kind
voice
saying
the
other
end
the
shed
you
come

rascal
she
remembers
now
now
that
and
the
soldier
pushing
away

him

place
and
sat
down
his
hands

something
wrapped

respectful
tone

the

the
smell

seemed
extremely
pleasant

the
soldier
and
began

the
soldier
with
smile

drew
out
his
clasp

cut
the
potato
into
two
equal
halves
the
palm
his

sprinkled
some
salt
from
the
rag
and
handed

but

poor
fellows
the
last
one

tss
said
the
little
man
what
sin

added
quickly
and
his
words
were
always
waiting
ready
his
mouth
and
flew
out
involuntarily
went
how

the
soldier
lips

but
when
you
drawn
out
empty
that
how
and
platon
shifted
his
seat
the
straw
after
short
silence
rose
well
think
you
must
sleepy
said
and
began
rapidly
crossing
himself
and
repeating

frola
and
lavra
lord
jesus
christ
holy
saint
nicholas
frola
and
lavra
lord
jesus
christ
have
mercy
and
save
concluded
then
bowed
the
ground
got
sighed
and
sat
down
again
his
heap
straw
that
the
way
lay
down
like
stone
god
and
raise
like
loaf
muttered
lay
down
pulling
his
coat
over
him
what
prayer
was
that
you
were
saying
asked
pierre
murmured
platon
who
had
almost
fallen
asleep
what
was
saying
was
praying
don
you
pray
yes
said
pierre
but
what
was
that
you
said
frola
and
lavra
well
course
replied
platon
quickly
the
horses
saints
one
must
pity
the
animals
too
the
rascal
now
you
curled
and
got
warm
you
daughter
bitch
said
karataev
touching
the
dog
that
lay
his
feet
and
again
turning
over
fell
asleep
immediately
sounds
crying
and
screaming
came
from
somewhere
the
distance
outside
and
flames
were
visible
through
the
cracks
the
shed
but
inside
was
quiet
and
dark
for
long
time
pierre
did
not
sleep
but
lay
with
eyes
open
the
darkness
listening
the
regular
snoring
platon
who
lay
beside
him
and
felt
that
the
world
that
had
been
shattered
was
once
more
stirring
his
soul
with
new
beauty
and
new
and
unshakable
foundations
chapter
xiii
twenty
three
soldiers
three
officers
and
two
officials
were
confined
the
shed
which
pierre
had
been
placed
and
where
remained
for
four
weeks
when
pierre
remembered
them
afterwards
they
all
seemed
misty
figures
him
except
platon
karataev
who
always
remained
his
mind
most
vivid
and
precious
memory
and
the
personification
everything
russian
kindly
and
round
when
pierre
saw
his
neighbor
next
morning
dawn
the
first
impression
him
something
round
was
fully
confirmed
platon
whole
figure
french
overcoat
girdled
with
cord
soldier
cap
and
bast
shoes
was
round
his
head
was
quite
round
his
back
chest
shoulders
and
even
his
arms
which
held
ever
ready
embrace
something
were
rounded
his
pleasant
smile
and
his
large
gentle
brown
eyes
were
also
round
platon
karataev
must
have
been
fifty
judging
his
stories
campaigns
had
been
told
old
soldier
did
not
himself
know
his
age
and
was
quite
unable
determine
but
his
brilliantly
white
strong
teeth
which
showed
two
unbroken
semicircles
when
laughed
often
did
were
all
sound
and
good
there
was
not
gray
hair
his
beard
his
head
and
his
whole
body
gave
impression
suppleness
and
especially
firmness
and
endurance
his
face
despite
its
fine
rounded
wrinkles
had
expression
innocence
and
youth
his
voice
was
pleasant
and
musical
but
the
chief
peculiarity
his
speech
was
its
directness
and
appositeness
was
evident
that
never
considered
what
had
said
was
going
say
and
consequently
the
rapidity
and
justice
his
intonation
had
irresistible
persuasiveness
his
physical
strength
and
agility
during
the
first
days
his
imprisonment
were
such
that
seemed
not
know
what
fatigue
and
sickness
meant
every
night
before
lying
down
said
lord
lay
down
stone
and
raise
loaf
and
every
morning
getting
said
lay
down
and
curled
get
and
shake
myself
and
indeed
only
had
lie
down
fall
asleep
like
stone
and
only
had
shake
himself
ready
without
moment
delay
for
some
work
just
children
are
ready
play
directly
they
awake
could
everything
not
very
well
but
not
badly
baked
cooked
sewed
planed
and
mended
boots
was
always
busy
and
only
night
allowed
himself
conversation
which
was
fond
and
songs
did
not
sing
like
trained
singer
who
knows
listened
but
like
the
birds
evidently
giving
vent
the
sounds
the
same
way
that
one
stretches
oneself
walks
about
get
rid
stiffness
and
the
sounds
were
always
high
pitched
mournful
delicate
and
almost
feminine
and
his
face
such
times
was
very
serious
having
been
taken
prisoner
and
allowed
his
beard
grow
seemed
have
thrown
off
all
that
had
been
forced
upon
him
everything
military
and
alien
himself
and
had
returned
his
former
peasant
habits
soldier
leave
shirt
outside
breeches
would
say
did
not
like
talking
about
his
life
soldier
though
did
not
complain
and
often
mentioned
that
had
not
been
flogged
once
during
the
whole
his
army
service
when
related
anything
was
generally
some
old
and
evidently
precious
memory
his
christian
life
called
his
peasant
existence
the
proverbs
which
his
talk
was
full
were
for
the
most
part
not
the
coarse
and
indecent
saws
soldiers
employ
but
those
folk
sayings
which
taken
without
context
seem
insignificant
but
when
used
appositely
suddenly
acquire
significance
profound
wisdom
would
often
say
the
exact
opposite
what
had
said
previous
occasion
yet
both
would
right
liked
talk
and
talked
well
adorning
his
speech
with
terms
endearment
and
with
folk
sayings
which
pierre
thought
invented
himself
but
the
chief
charm
his
talk
lay
the
fact
that
the
commonest
events
sometimes
just
such
pierre
had
witnessed
without
taking
notice
them
assumed
karataev
character
solemn
fitness
liked
hear
the
folk
tales
one
the
soldiers
used
tell
evening
they
were
always
the
same
but
most
all
liked
hear
stories
real
life
would
smile
joyfully
when
listening
such
stories
now
and
then
putting
word
asking
question
make
the
moral
beauty
what
was
told
clear
himself
karataev
had
attachments
friendships
love
pierre
understood
them
but
loved
and
lived
affectionately
with
everything
life
brought
him
contact
with
particularly
with
man
not
any
particular
man
but
those
with
whom
happened
loved
his
dog
his
comrades
the
french
and
pierre
who
was
his
neighbor
but
pierre
felt
that
spite
karataev
affectionate
tenderness
for
him
which
unconsciously
gave
pierre
spiritual
life
its
due
would
not
have
grieved
for
moment
parting
from
him
and
pierre
began
feel
the
same
way
toward
karataev
all
the
other
prisoners
platon
karataev
seemed
most
ordinary
soldier
they
called
him
little
falcon
platosha
chaffed
him
good
naturedly
and
sent
him
errands
but
pierre
always
remained
what
had
seemed
that
first
night
unfathomable
rounded
eternal
personification
the
spirit
simplicity
and
truth
platon
karataev
knew
nothing
heart
except
his
prayers
when
began
speak
seemed
not
know
how
would
conclude
sometimes
pierre
struck
the
meaning
his
words
would
ask
him
repeat
them
but
platon
could
never
recall
what
had
said
moment
before
just
never
could
repeat
pierre
the
words
his
favorite
song
native
and
birch
tree
and
heart
sick
occurred
but
when
spoken
and
not
sung
meaning
could
got
out
did
not
and
could
not
understand
the
meaning
words
apart
from
their
context
every
word
and
action
his
was
the
manifestation
activity
unknown
him
which
was
his
life
but
his
life
regarded
had
meaning
separate
thing
had
meaning
only
part
whole
which
was
always
conscious
his
words
and
actions
flowed
from
him
evenly
inevitably
and
spontaneously
fragrance
exhales
from
flower
could
not
understand
the
value
significance
any
word
deed
taken
separately
chapter
xiv
when
princess
mary
heard
from
nicholas
that
her
brother
was
with
the
rostovs
yaroslavl
she
once
prepared
there
spite
her
aunt
efforts
dissuade
her
and
not
merely
herself
but
take
her
nephew
with
her
whether
were
difficult
easy
possible
impossible
she
did
not
ask
and
did
not
want
know
was
her
duty
not
only
herself
near
her
brother
who
was
perhaps
dying
but
everything
possible
take
his
son
him
and
she
prepared
set
off
that
she
had
not
heard
from
prince
andrew
himself
princess
mary
attributed
his
being
too
weak
write
his
considering
the
long
journey
too
hard
and
too
dangerous
for
her
and
his
son
few
days
princess
mary
was
ready
start
her
equipages
were
the
huge
family
coach
which
she
had
traveled
voronezh
semiopen
trap
and
baggage
cart
with
her
traveled
mademoiselle
bourienne
little
nicholas
and
his
tutor
her
old
nurse
three
maids
tikhon
and
young
footman
and
courier
her
aunt
had
sent
accompany
her
the
usual
route
through
moscow
could
not
thought
and
the
roundabout
way
princess
mary
was
obliged
take
through
lipetsk
ryazan
vladimir
and
shuya
was
very
long
and
post
horses
were
not
everywhere
obtainable
very
difficult
and
near
ryazan
where
the
french
were
said
have
shown
themselves
was
even
dangerous
during
this
difficult
journey
mademoiselle
bourienne
dessalles
and
princess
mary
servants
were
astonished
her
energy
and
firmness
spirit
she
went
bed
later
and
rose
earlier
than
any
them
and
difficulties
daunted
her
thanks
her
activity
and
energy
which
infected
her
fellow
travelers
they
approached
yaroslavl
the
end
the
second
week
the
last
days
her
stay
voronezh
had
been
the
happiest
her
life
her
love
for
rostov
longer
tormented
agitated
her
filled
her
whole
soul
had
become
integral
part
herself
and
she
longer
struggled
against
latterly
she
had
become
convinced
that
she
loved
and
was
beloved
though
she
never
said
this
definitely
herself
words
she
had
become
convinced
her
last
interview
with
nicholas
when
had
come
tell
her
that
her
brother
was
with
the
rostovs
not
single
word
had
nicholas
alluded
the
fact
that
prince
andrew
relations
with
natasha
might
recovered
renewed
but
princess
mary
saw
his
face
that
knew
and
thought
this
yet
spite
that
his
relation
her
considerate
delicate
and
loving
not
only
remained
unchanged
but
sometimes
seemed
princess
mary
that
was
even
glad
that
the
family
connection
between
them
allowed
him
express
his
friendship
more
freely
she
knew
that
she
loved
for
the
first
and
only
time
her
life
and
felt
that
she
was
beloved
and
was
happy
regard
but
this
happiness
one
side
her
spiritual
nature
did
not
prevent
her
feeling
grief
for
her
brother
with
full
force
the
contrary
that
spiritual
tranquility
the
one
side
made
the
more
possible
for
her
give
full
play
her
feeling
for
her
brother
that
feeling
was
strong
the
moment
leaving
voronezh
that
those
who
saw
her
off
they
looked
her
careworn
despairing
face
felt
sure
she
would
fall
ill
the
journey
but
the
very
difficulties
and
preoccupations
the
journey
which
she
took
actively
hand
saved
her
for
while
from
her
grief
and
gave
her
strength
always
happens
when
traveling
princess
mary
thought
only
the
journey
itself
forgetting
its
object
but
she
approached
yaroslavl
the
thought
what
might
await
her
there
not
after
many
days
but
that
very
evening
again
presented
itself
her
and
her
agitation
increased
its
utmost
limit
the
courier
who
had
been
sent
advance
find
out
where
the
rostovs
were
staying
yaroslavl
and
what
condition
prince
andrew
was
when
met
the
big
coach
just
entering
the
town
gates
was
appalled
the
terrible
pallor
the
princess
face
that
looked
out
him
from
the
window
have
found
out
everything
your
excellency
the
rostovs
are
staying
the
merchant
bronnikov
house
the
square
not
far
from
here
right
above
the
volga
said
the
courier
princess
mary
looked
him
with
frightened
inquiry
not
understanding
why
did
not
reply
what
she
chiefly
wanted
know
how
was
her
brother
mademoiselle
bourienne
put
that
question
for
her
how
the
prince
she
asked
his
excellency
staying
the
same
house
with
them
then
alive
thought
princess
mary
and
asked
low
voice
how
the
servants
say
still
the
same
what
still
the
same
might
mean
princess
mary
did
not
ask
but
with
unnoticed
glance
little
seven
year
old
nicholas
who
was
sitting
front
her
looking
with
pleasure
the
town
she
bowed
her
head
and
did
not
raise
again
till
the
heavy
coach
rumbling
shaking
and
swaying
came
stop
the
carriage
steps
clattered
they
were
let
down
the
carriage
door
was
opened
the
left
there
was
water
great
river
and
the
right
porch
there
were
people
the
entrance
servants
and
rosy
girl
with
large
plait
black
hair
smiling
seemed
princess
mary
unpleasantly
affected
way
this
was
sonya
princess
mary
ran
the
steps
this
way
this
way
said
the
girl
with
the
same
artificial
smile
and
the
princess
found
herself
the
hall
facing
elderly
woman
oriental
type
who
came
rapidly
meet
her
with
look
emotion
this
was
the
countess
she
embraced
princess
mary
and
kissed
her
mon
enfant
she
muttered
vous
aime
vous
connais
depuis
longtemps
child
love
you
and
have
known
you
long
time
despite
her
excitement
princess
mary
realized
that
this
was
the
countess
and
that
was
necessary
say
something
her
hardly
knowing
how
she
did
she
contrived
utter
few
polite
phrases
french
the
same
tone
those
that
had
been
addressed
her
and
asked
how
the
doctor
says
that
not
danger
said
the
countess
but
she
spoke
she
raised
her
eyes
with
sigh
and
her
gesture
conveyed
contradiction
her
words
where
can
see
him
can
asked
the
princess
one
moment
princess
one
moment
dear
this
his
son
said
the
countess
turning
little
nicholas
who
was
coming
with
dessalles
there
will
room
for
everybody
this
big
house
what
lovely
boy
the
countess
took
princess
mary
into
the
drawing
room
where
sonya
was
talking
mademoiselle
bourienne
the
countess
caressed
the
boy
and
the
old
count
came
and
welcomed
the
princess
had
changed
very
much
since
princess
mary
had
last
seen
him
then
had
been
brisk
cheerful
self
assured
old
man
now
seemed
pitiful
bewildered
person
while
talking
princess
mary
continually
looked
round
asking
everyone
whether
was
doing
the
right
thing
after
the
destruction
moscow
and
his
property
thrown
out
his
accustomed
groove
seemed
have
lost
the
sense
his
own
significance
and
feel
that
there
was
longer
place
for
him
life
spite
her
one
desire
see
her
brother
soon
possible
and
her
vexation
that
the
moment
when
all
she
wanted
was
see
him
they
should
trying
entertain
her
and
pretending
admire
her
nephew
the
princess
noticed
all
that
was
going
around
her
and
felt
the
necessity
submitting
for
time
this
new
order
things
which
she
had
entered
she
knew
necessary
and
though
was
hard
for
her
she
was
not
vexed
with
these
people
this
niece
said
the
count
introducing
sonya
you
don
know
her
princess
princess
mary
turned
sonya
and
trying
stifle
the
hostile
feeling
that
arose
her
toward
the
girl
she
kissed
her
but
she
felt
oppressed
the
fact
that
the
mood
everyone
around
her
was
far
from
what
was
her
own
heart
where
she
asked
again
addressing
them
all
downstairs
natasha
with
him
answered
sonya
flushing

she
turned
away
and
was
about
ask
the
countess
again
how
him
when
light
impetuous
and
seemingly
buoyant
steps
were
heard
the
door
the
princess
looked
round
and
saw
natasha
coming
almost
running
that
natasha
whom
she
had
liked
little
their
meeting
moscow
long
since
but
hardly
had
the
princess
looked
natasha
face
before
she
realized
that
here
was
real
comrade
her
grief
and
consequently
friend
she
ran
meet
her
embraced
her
and
began
cry
her
shoulder
soon
natasha
sitting
the
head
prince
andrew
bed
heard
princess
mary
arrival
she
softly
left
his
room
and
hastened
her
with
those
swift
steps
that
had
sounded
buoyant
princess
mary
there
was
only
one
expression
her
agitated
face
when
she
ran
into
the
drawing
room
that
love
boundless
love
for
him
for
her
and
for
all
that
was
near
the
man
she
loved
and
pity
suffering
for
others
and
passionate
desire
give
herself
entirely
helping
them
was
plain
that
that
moment
there
was
natasha
heart
thought
herself
her
own
relations
with
prince
andrew
princess
mary
with
her
acute
sensibility
understood
all
this
the
first
glance
natasha
face
and
wept
her
shoulder
with
sorrowful
pleasure
come
come
him
mary
said
natasha
leading
her
into
the
other
room
princess
mary
raised
her
head
dried
her
eyes
and
turned
natasha
she
felt
that
from
her
she
would
able
understand
and
learn
everything
how
she
began
her
question
but
stopped
short
she
felt
that
was
impossible
ask
answer
words
natasha
face
and
eyes
would
have
tell
her
all
more
clearly
and
profoundly
natasha
was
gazing
her
but
seemed
afraid
and
doubt
whether
say
all
she
knew
not
she
seemed
feel
that
before
those
luminous
eyes
which
penetrated
into
the
very
depths
her
heart
was
impossible
not
tell
the
whole
truth
which
she
saw
and
suddenly
natasha
lips
twitched
ugly
wrinkles
gathered
round
her
mouth
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
burst
into
sobs
princess
mary
understood
but
she
still
hoped
and
asked
words
she
herself
did
not
trust
but
how
his
wound
what
his
general
condition
you
you
will
see
was
all
natasha
could
say
they
sat
little
while
downstairs
near
his
room
till
they
had
left
off
crying
and
were
able
him
with
calm
faces
how
has
his
whole
illness
gone
long
since
grew
worse
when
did
this
happen
princess
mary
inquired
natasha
told
her
that
first
there
had
been
danger
from
his
feverish
condition
and
the
pain
suffered
but
troitsa
that
had
passed
and
the
doctor
had
only
been
afraid
gangrene
that
danger
had
also
passed
when
they
reached
yaroslavl
the
wound
had
begun
fester
natasha
knew
all
about
such
things
festering
and
the
doctor
had
said
that
the
festering
might
take
normal
course
then
fever
set
but
the
doctor
had
said
the
fever
was
not
very
serious
but
two
days
ago
this
suddenly
happened
said
natasha
struggling
with
her
sobs
don
know
why
but
you
will
see
what
like
weaker
thinner
asked
the
princess
not
that
but
worse
you
will
see
mary
too
good
cannot
cannot
live
because
chapter
when
natasha
opened
prince
andrew
door
with
familiar
movement
and
let
princess
mary
pass
into
the
room
before
her
the
princess
felt
the
sobs
her
throat
hard
she
had
tried
prepare
herself
and
now
tried
remain
tranquil
she
knew
that
she
would
unable
look
him
without
tears
the
princess
understood
what
natasha
had
meant
the
words
two
days
ago
this
suddenly
happened
she
understood
those
words
mean
that
had
suddenly
softened
and
that
this
softening
and
gentleness
were
signs
approaching
death
she
stepped
the
door
she
already
saw
imagination
andrew
face
she
remembered
childhood
gentle
mild
sympathetic
face
which
had
rarely
shown
and
which
therefore
affected
her
very
strongly
she
was
sure
would
speak
soft
tender
words
her
such
her
father
had
uttered
before
his
death
and
that
she
would
not
able
bear
and
would
burst
into
sobs
his
presence
yet
sooner
later
had
and
she
went
the
sobs
rose
higher
and
higher
her
throat
she
more
and
more
clearly
distinguished
his
form
and
her
shortsighted
eyes
tried
make
out
his
features
and
then
she
saw
his
face
and
met
his
gaze
was
lying
squirrel
fur
dressing
gown
divan
surrounded
pillows
was
thin
and
pale
one
thin
translucently
white
hand
held
handkerchief
while
with
the
other
stroked
the
delicate
mustache
had
grown
moving
his
fingers
slowly
his
eyes
gazed
them
they
entered
seeing
his
face
and
meeting
his
eyes
princess
mary
pace
suddenly
slackened
she
felt
her
tears
dry
and
her
sobs
ceased
she
suddenly
felt
guilty
and
grew
timid
catching
the
expression
his
face
and
eyes
but
what
blame
she
asked
herself
and
his
cold
stern
look
replied
because
you
are
alive
and
thinking
the
living
while
the
deep
gaze
that
seemed
look
not
outwards
but
inwards
there
was
almost
hostile
expression
slowly
regarded
his
sister
and
natasha
kissed
his
sister
holding
her
hand
his
was
their
wont
how
are
you
mary
how
did
you
manage
get
here
said
voice
calm
and
aloof
his
look
had
screamed
agony
that
scream
would
not
have
struck
such
horror
into
princess
mary
heart
the
tone
his
voice
and
have
you
brought
little
nicholas
asked
the
same
slow
quiet
manner
and
with
obvious
effort
remember
how
are
you
now
said
princess
mary
herself
surprised
what
she
was
saying
that
dear
you
must
ask
the
doctor
replied
and
again
making
evident
effort
affectionate
said
with
his
lips
only
his
words
clearly
did
not
correspond
his
thoughts
merci
chere
amie
etre
venue
thank
you
for
coming
dear
princess
mary
pressed
his
hand
the
pressure
made
him
wince
just
perceptibly
was
silent
and
she
did
not
know
what
say
she
now
understood
what
had
happened
him
two
days
before
his
words
his
tone
and
especially
that
calm
almost
antagonistic
look
could
felt
estrangement
from
everything
belonging
this
world
terrible
one
who
alive
evidently
only
with
effort
did
understand
anything
living
but
was
obvious
that
failed
understand
not
because
lacked
the
power
but
because
understood
something
else
something
the
living
did
not
and
could
not
understand
and
which
wholly
occupied
his
mind
there
you
see
how
strangely
fate
has
brought
together
said
breaking
the
silence
and
pointing
natasha
she
looks
after
all
the
time
princess
mary
heard
him
and
did
not
understand
how
could
say
such
thing
the
sensitive
tender
prince
andrew
how
could
say
that
before
her
whom
loved
and
who
loved
him
had
expected
live
could
not
have
said
those
words
that
offensively
cold
tone
had
not
known
that
was
dying
how
could
have
failed
pity
her
and
how
could
speak
like
that
her
presence
the
only
explanation
was
that
was
indifferent
because
something
else
much
more
important
had
been
revealed
him
the
conversation
was
cold
and
disconnected
and
continually
broke
off
mary
came
way
ryazan
said
natasha
prince
andrew
did
not
notice
that
she
called
his
sister
mary
and
only
after
calling
her
his
presence
did
natasha
notice
herself
really
asked
they
told
her
that
all
moscow
has
been
burned
down
and
that
natasha
stopped
was
impossible
talk
was
plain
that
was
making
effort
listen
but
could
not
yes
they
say
burned
said
great
pity
and
gazed
straight
before
him
absently
stroking
his
mustache
with
his
fingers
and
you
have
met
count
nicholas
mary
prince
andrew
suddenly
said
evidently
wishing
speak
pleasantly
them
wrote
here
that
took
great
liking
you
went
simply
and
calmly
evidently
unable
understand
all
the
complex
significance
his
words
had
for
living
people
you
liked
him
too
would
good
thing
for
you
get
married
added
rather
more
quickly
pleased
having
found
words
had
long
been
seeking
princess
mary
heard
his
words
but
they
had
meaning
for
her
except
proof
how
far
away
now
was
from
everything
living
why
talk
she
said
quietly
and
glanced
natasha
natasha
who
felt
her
glance
did
not
look
her
all
three
were
again
silent
andrew
would
you
like
princess
mary
suddenly
said
trembling
voice
would
you
like
see
little
nicholas
always
talking
about
you
prince
andrew
smiled
just
perceptibly
and
for
the
first
time
but
princess
mary
who
knew
his
face
well
saw
with
horror
that
did
not
smile
with
pleasure
affection
for
his
son
but
with
quiet
gentle
irony
because
thought
she
was
trying
what
she
believed
the
last
means
arousing
him
yes
shall
very
glad
see
him
quite
well
when
little
nicholas
was
brought
into
prince
andrew
room
looked
his
father
with
frightened
eyes
but
did
not
cry
because
one
else
was
crying
prince
andrew
kissed
him
and
evidently
did
not
know
what
say
him
when
nicholas
had
been
led
away
princess
mary
again
went
her
brother
kissed
him
and
unable
restrain
her
tears
any
longer
began
cry
looked
her
attentively
about
nicholas
asked
princess
mary
nodded
her
head
weeping
mary
you
know
the
gosp
but
broke
off
what
did
you
say
nothing
you
mustn
cry
here
said
looking
her
with
the
same
cold
expression
when
princess
mary
began
cry
understood
that
she
was
crying
the
thought
that
little
nicholas
would
left
without
father
with
great
effort
tried
return
life
and
see
things
from
their
point
view
yes
them
must
seem
sad
thought
but
how
simple
the
fowls
the
air
sow
not
neither
they
reap
yet
your
father
feedeth
them
said
himself
and
wished
say
princess
mary
but
they
will
take
their
own
way
they
won
understand
they
can
understand
that
all
those
feelings
they
prize
all
our
feelings
all
those
ideas
that
seem
important
are
unnecessary
cannot
understand
one
another
and
remained
silent
prince
andrew
little
son
was
seven
could
scarcely
read
and
knew
nothing
after
that
day
lived
through
many
things
gaining
knowledge
observation
and
experience
but
had
possessed
all
the
faculties
afterwards
acquired
could
not
have
had
better
more
profound
understanding
the
meaning
the
scene
had
witnessed
between
his
father
mary
and
natasha
than
had
then
understood
completely
and
leaving
the
room
without
crying
went
silently
natasha
who
had
come
out
with
him
and
looked
shyly
her
with
his
beautiful
thoughtful
eyes
then
his
uplifted
rosy
upper
lip
trembled
and
leaning
his
head
against
her
began
cry
after
that
avoided
dessalles
and
the
countess
who
caressed
him
and
either
sat
alone
came
timidly
princess
mary
natasha
whom
seemed
even
fonder
than
his
aunt
and
clung
them
quietly
and
shyly
when
princess
mary
had
left
prince
andrew
she
fully
understood
what
natasha
face
had
told
her
she
did
not
speak
any
more
natasha
hopes
saving
his
life
she
took
turns
with
her
beside
his
sofa
and
did
not
cry
any
more
but
prayed
continually
turning
soul
that
eternal
and
unfathomable
whose
presence
above
the
dying
man
was
now
evident
chapter
xvi
not
only
did
prince
andrew
know
would
die
but
felt
that
was
dying
and
was
already
half
dead
was
conscious
aloofness
from
everything
earthly
and
strange
and
joyous
lightness
existence
without
haste
agitation
awaited
what
was
coming
that
inexorable
eternal
distant
and
unknown
the
presence
which
had
felt
continually
all
his
life
was
now
near
him
and
the
strange
lightness
experienced
almost
comprehensible
and
palpable
formerly
had
feared
the
end
had
twice
experienced
that
terribly
tormenting
fear
death
the
end
but
now
longer
understood
that
fear
had
felt
for
the
first
time
when
the
shell
spun
like
top
before
him
and
looked
the
fallow
field
the
bushes
and
the
sky
and
knew
that
was
face
face
with
death
when
came
himself
after
being
wounded
and
the
flower
eternal
unfettered
love
had
instantly
unfolded
itself
his
soul
freed
from
the
bondage
life
that
had
restrained
longer
feared
death
and
ceased
think
about
during
the
hours
solitude
suffering
and
partial
delirium
spent
after
was
wounded
the
more
deeply
penetrated
into
the
new
principle
eternal
love
revealed
him
the
more
unconsciously
detached
himself
from
earthly
life
love
everything
and
everybody
and
always
sacrifice
oneself
for
love
meant
not
love
anyone
not
live
this
earthly
life
and
the
more
imbued
became
with
that
principle
love
the
more
renounced
life
and
the
more
completely
destroyed
that
dreadful
barrier
which
the
absence
such
love
stands
between
life
and
death
when
during
those
first
days
remembered
that
would
have
die
said
himself
well
what
much
the
better
but
after
the
night
mytishchi
when
half
delirious
had
seen
her
for
whom
longed
appear
before
him
and
having
pressed
her
hand
his
lips
had
shed
gentle
happy
tears
love
for
particular
woman
again
crept
unobserved
into
his
heart
and
once
more
bound
him
life
and
joyful
and
agitating
thoughts
began
occupy
his
mind
recalling
the
moment
the
ambulance
station
when
had
seen
kuragin
could
not
now
regain
the
feeling
then
had
but
was
tormented
the
question
whether
kuragin
was
alive
and
dared
not
inquire
his
illness
pursued
its
normal
physical
course
but
what
natasha
referred
when
she
said
this
suddenly
happened
had
occurred
two
days
before
princess
mary
arrived
was
the
last
spiritual
struggle
between
life
and
death
which
death
gained
the
victory
was
the
unexpected
realization
the
fact
that
still
valued
life
presented
him
the
form
his
love
for
natasha
and
last
though
ultimately
vanquished
attack
terror
before
the
unknown
was
evening
usual
after
dinner
was
slightly
feverish
and
his
thoughts
were
preternaturally
clear
sonya
was
sitting
the
table
began
doze
suddenly
feeling
happiness
seized
him
she
has
come
thought
and
was
sonya
place
sat
natasha
who
had
just
come
noiselessly
since
she
had
begun
looking
after
him
had
always
experienced
this
physical
consciousness
her
nearness
she
was
sitting
armchair
placed
sideways
screening
the
light
the
candle
from
him
and
was
knitting
stocking
she
had
learned
knit
stockings
since
prince
andrew
had
casually
mentioned
that
one
nursed
the
sick
well
old
nurses
who
knit
stockings
and
that
there
something
soothing
the
knitting
stockings
the
needles
clicked
lightly
her
slender
rapidly
moving
hands
and
could
clearly
see
the
thoughtful
profile
her
drooping
face
she
moved
and
the
ball
rolled
off
her
knees
she
started
glanced
round
him
and
screening
the
candle
with
her
hand
stooped
carefully
with
supple
and
exact
movement
picked
the
ball
and
regained
her
former
position
looked
her
without
moving
and
saw
that
she
wanted
draw
deep
breath
after
stooping
but
refrained
from
doing
and
breathed
cautiously
the
troitsa
monastery
they
had
spoken
the
past
and
had
told
her
that
lived
would
always
thank
god
for
his
wound
which
had
brought
them
together
again
but
after
that
they
never
spoke
the
future
can
can
not
now
thought
looked
her
and
listened
the
light
click
the
steel
needles
can
fate
have
brought
her
strangely
only
for
die
possible
that
the
truth
life
has
been
revealed
only
show
that
have
spent
life
falsity
love
her
more
than
anything
the
world
but
what
love
her
thought
and
involuntarily
groaned
from
habit
acquired
during
his
sufferings
hearing
that
sound
natasha
put
down
the
stocking
leaned
nearer
him
and
suddenly
noticing
his
shining
eyes
stepped
lightly
him
and
bent
over
him
you
are
not
asleep
have
been
looking
you
long
time
felt
you
come
one
else
gives
that
sense
soft
tranquillity
that
you
that
light
want
weep
for
joy
natasha
drew
closer
him
her
face
shone
with
rapturous
joy
natasha
love
you
too
much
more
than
anything
the
world
and
she
turned
away
for
instant
why
too
much
she
asked
why
too
much
well
what
you
what
you
feel
your
soul
your
whole
soul
shall
live
what
you
think
sure
sure
natasha
almost
shouted
taking
hold
both
his
hands
with
passionate
movement
remained
silent
awhile
how
good
would
and
taking
her
hand
kissed
natasha
felt
happy
and
agitated
but
once
remembered
that
this
would
not
and
that
had
quiet
but
you
have
not
slept
she
said
repressing
her
joy
try
sleep
please
pressed
her
hand
and
released
and
she
went
back
the
candle
and
sat
down
again
her
former
position
twice
she
turned
and
looked
him
and
her
eyes
met
his
beaming
her
she
set
herself
task
her
stocking
and
resolved
not
turn
round
till
was
finished
soon
really
shut
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
did
not
sleep
long
and
suddenly
awoke
with
start
and
cold
perspiration
fell
asleep
had
still
been
thinking
the
subject
that
now
always
occupied
his
mind
about
life
and
death
and
chiefly
about
death
felt
himself
nearer
love
what

these
thoughts
seemed
him
comforting
but
they
were
only
thoughts
something
was
lacking
them
they
were
not
clear
they
were
too
one
sidedly
personal
and
brain
spun
and
there
was
the
former
agitation
and
obscurity
fell
asleep
dreamed
that
was
lying
the
room
really
was
but
that
was
quite
well
and
unwounded
many
various
indifferent
and
insignificant
people
appeared
before
him
talked
them
and
discussed
something
trivial
they
were
preparing
away
somewhere
prince
andrew
dimly
realized
that
all
this
was
trivial
and
that
had
more
important
cares
but
continued
speak
surprising
them
empty
witticisms
gradually
unnoticed
all
these
persons
began
disappear
and
single
question
that
the
closed
door
superseded
all
else
rose
and
went
the
door
bolt
and
lock
everything
depended
whether
was
was
not
time
lock
went
and
tried
hurry
but
his
legs
refused
move
and
knew
would
not
time
lock
the
door
though
painfully
strained
all
his
powers
was
seized
agonizing
fear
and
that
fear
was
the
fear
death
stood
behind
the
door
but
just
when
was
clumsily
creeping
toward
the
door
that
dreadful
something
the
other
side
was
already
pressing
against
and
forcing
its
way
something
not
human
death
was
breaking
through
that
door
and
had
kept
out
seized
the
door
making
final
effort
hold
back
lock
was
longer
possible
but
his
efforts
were
weak
and
clumsy
and
the
door
pushed
from
behind
that
terror
opened
and
closed
again
once
again
pushed
from
outside
his
last
superhuman
efforts
were
vain
and
both
halves
the
door
noiselessly
opened
entered
and
was
death
and
prince
andrew
died
but
the
instant
died
prince
andrew
remembered
that
was
asleep
and
the
very
instant
died
having
made
effort
awoke
yes
was
death
died
and
woke
yes
death
awakening
and
all
once
grew
light
his
soul
and
the
veil
that
had
till
then
concealed
the
unknown
was
lifted
from
his
spiritual
vision
felt
powers
till
then
confined
within
him
had
been
liberated
and
that
strange
lightness
did
not
again
leave
him
when
waking
cold
perspiration
moved
the
divan
natasha
went
and
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
did
not
answer
and
looked
her
strangely
not
understanding
that
was
what
had
happened
him
two
days
before
princess
mary
arrival
from
that
day
the
doctor
expressed
the
wasting
fever
assumed
malignant
character
but
what
the
doctor
said
did
not
interest
natasha
she
saw
the
terrible
moral
symptoms
which
her
were
more
convincing
from
that
day
awakening
from
life
came
prince
andrew
together
with
his
awakening
from
sleep
and
compared
the
duration
life
did
not
seem
him
slower
than
awakening
from
sleep
compared
the
duration
dream
there
was
nothing
terrible
violent
this
comparatively
slow
awakening
his
last
days
and
hours
passed
ordinary
and
simple
way
both
princess
mary
and
natasha
who
did
not
leave
him
felt
this
they
did
not
weep
shudder
and
during
these
last
days
they
themselves
felt
that
they
were
not
attending
him
was
longer
there
had
left
them
but
what
reminded
them
most
closely
him
his
body
both
felt
this
strongly
that
the
outward
and
terrible
side
death
did
not
affect
them
and
they
did
not
feel
necessary
foment
their
grief
neither
his
presence
nor
out
did
they
weep
nor
did
they
ever
talk
one
another
about
him
they
felt
that
they
could
not
express
words
what
they
understood
they
both
saw
that
was
sinking
slowly
and
quietly
deeper
and
deeper
away
from
them
and
they
both
knew
that
this
had
and
that
was
right
confessed
and
received
communion
everyone
came
take
leave
him
when
they
brought
his
son
him
pressed
his
lips
the
boy
and
turned
away
not
because
felt
hard
and
sad
princess
mary
and
natasha
understood
that
but
simply
because
thought
was
all
that
was
required
him
but
when
they
told
him
bless
the
boy
did
what
was
demanded
and
looked
round
asking
whether
there
was
anything
else
should
when
the
last
convulsions
the
body
which
the
spirit
was
leaving
occurred
princess
mary
and
natasha
were
present
over
said
princess
mary
when
his
body
had
for
few
minutes
lain
motionless
growing
cold
before
them
natasha
went
looked
the
dead
eyes
and
hastened
close
them
she
closed
them
but
did
not
kiss
them
but
clung
that
which
reminded
her
most
nearly
him
his
body
where
has
gone
where
now
when
the
body
washed
and
dressed
lay
the
coffin
table
everyone
came
take
leave
him
and
they
all
wept
little
nicholas
cried
because
his
heart
was
rent
painful
perplexity
the
countess
and
sonya
cried
from
pity
for
natasha
and
because
was
more
the
old
count
cried
because
felt
that
before
long
too
must
take
the
same
terrible
step
natasha
and
princess
mary
also
wept
now
but
not
because
their
own
personal
grief
they
wept
with
reverent
and
softening
emotion
which
had
taken
possession
their
souls
the
consciousness
the
simple
and
solemn

had

moscow
the
enemy
and
its

fire
the
most
important
episode
the
war
was
the
movement
the
russian
army
from
the
ryazana
the
kaluga
road
and
the
tarutino
camp
the
called
flank
march
across
the
krasnaya

river
they
ascribe
the
glory
that
achievement
genius
different
men
and
dispute
whom
the
honor
due
even
foreign
historians
including
the
french
acknowledge
the
genius
the
russian
commanders
when
they
speak
that
flank
march
but
hard
understand
why
military
writers
and
following
them
others
consider
this
flank
march
the
profound
conception
some
one
man
who
saved
russia
and
destroyed
napoleon
the
first
place
hard
understand
where
the
profundity
and
genius
this
movement
lay
for
not
much
mental
effort
was
needed
see
that
the
best
position
for
army
when
not
being
attacked
where
there
are
most
provisions
and
even
dull
boy
thirteen
could
have
guessed
that
the
best
position
for
army
after
its
retreat
from
moscow
was
the
kaluga
road
impossible
understand
what
reasoning
the
historians
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
maneuver
was
profound
one
and
even
more
difficult
understand
just
why
they
think
that
this
maneuver
was
calculated
save
russia
and
destroy
the
french
for
this
flank
march
had
been
preceded
accompanied
followed
other
circumstances
might
have
proved
ruinous
the
russians
and
salutary
for
the
french
the
position
the
russian
army
really
began
improve
from
the
time
that
march
does
not
all
follow
that
the
march
was
the
cause
that
flank
march
might
not
only
have
failed
give
any
advantage
the
russian
army
but
might
other
circumstances
have
led
its
destruction

might
have
proved
disastrous
the
third
and
most
incomprehensible
thing
that
people
studying
history
deliberately
avoid
seeing
that
this
flank
march
cannot
attributed
any
one
man
that
one
ever
foresaw
and
that
reality
like
the
retreat
from
fili
did
not
suggest
itself
anyone
its
entirety
but
resulted
moment

event
event
from

its

when
had
been
accomplished
and

the
past
the
council
fili
the
prevailing
thought
the
minds
the
russian
commanders
was
the
one
naturally
suggesting
itself
namely
direct
retreat
the
nizhni
road
proof
this
there
the
fact
that
the
majority
the
council
voted
for
such
retreat
and
above
all
there
the
well
known
conversation
after
the
council
between
the
commander
chief
and
lanskoy
who
was
charge
the
commissariat
department
lanskoy
informed
the
commander
chief
that
the
army
supplies
were
for
the
most
part
stored
along
the
oka
the
tula
and
ryazan
provinces
and
that
they
retreated
nizhni
the
army
would
separated
from
its
supplies
the
broad
river
oka
which
cannot
crossed
early
winter
this
was
the
first
indication
the
necessity
deviating
from
what
had
previously
seemed
the
most
natural
course
direct
retreat
nizhni
novgorod
the
army
turned
more
the
south
along
the
ryazan
road
and
nearer
its
supplies

the
inactivity

french
who
even
lost
sight
the
russian
army
concern
for
the
safety
the
arsenal
tula
and
especially
the
advantages
drawing
nearer
its

the
army
turn
still
further
south
the
tula
road
having
crossed
over
forced
march
the
tula
road
beyond
the
pakhra
the
russian
commanders
intended
remain

and
had
thought
the
tarutino
position

innumerable
circumstances
and
the
reappearance
french
troops
who
had
for
time
lost
touch
with
the
russians
and
projects
giving
battle
and
above
all
the
abundance
provisions
kaluga
province
obliged
our
army
turn
still
more
the
south
and
cross
from
the
tula
the
kaluga
road
and
tarutino
which
was
between
the
roads
along
which
those
supplies
lay
just
impossible

when

there

and

begin
assure
themselves
that
they
had
desired
this
movement
and
long
ago
foreseen
its
result
chapter
the
famous
flank
movement
merely
consisted
this
after
the
advance
the
french
had
ceased
the
russian
army
which
had
been
continually
retreating
straight
back
from
the
invaders
deviated
from
that
direct
course
and
not
finding
itself
pursued
was
naturally
drawn
toward
the
district
where
supplies
were
abundant
instead
imagining
ourselves

leading
the
russian

picture
that
army
without
any
leaders
could
not
have
done
anything
but
make
return
movement
toward
moscow
describing
arc
the
direction
where
most
provisions
were
found
and
where
the
country
was
richest
that
movement
from
the
nizhni
the
ryazan
tula
and
kaluga
roads
was
natural
that
even
the
russian
marauders
moved
that
direction
and
demands
were
sent
from
petersburg
for
kutuzov
take
his
army
that
way
tarutino
kutuzov
received
what
was
almost
reprimand
from
the
emperor
for
having
moved
his
army
along
the
ryazan
road
and
the

letter
indicated
him
the
very

the

the
time
this
letter
which
proved
that
the
real
relation

had
already
made
itself
felt
petersburg
was
dispatched
kutuzov
had
found
himself
unable
any
longer
restrain
the

there
without

the
cossack
laughingly
told
his

almost
fallen

hearing
the

informed
his

the
cossack

for
and
questioned
the

one
the

taken
into

the
cossack
report
note
from
bennigsen
who
sent
personal

the

the

the
fact
that
all
the

expressed
the

check
the
inevitable

and
gave
the
order
what

the

fact
chapter
bennigsen
note
and
the
cossack

the

the

mounting
his

rode
off
someone
else
gone
out
only
they
don
make
responsible
for
this
delay
what
nuisance
thought
the
officer
and
rode
round
the
whole
camp
one
man
said
had
seen
ermolov
ride
past
with
some
other
generals
others
said

the

without

and
that
ermolov
was
probably
there
too
but
where
why
there
over
echkino
said
cossack
officer
pointing
country
house
the
far
distance
what
outside
our
line
they
put
two
regiments
outposts
and
they
having
such
spree
there
awful
two
bands
and
three
sets
singers
the
officer
rode
out
beyond
our
lines
echkino
while
still
distance
heard
rode
the
merry
sounds
soldier
dance
song
proceeding
from
the
house
the
meadows
the
meadows
heard
accompanied
whistling
and
the
sound
torban
drowned
every
now
and
then
shouts
these
sounds
made
his
spirits
rise
but
the
same
time
was
afraid
that
would
blamed
for
not
having
executed
sooner
the
important
order
entrusted
him
was
already
past
eight
clock
dismounted
and
went
into
the
porch
large
country
house
which
had
remained
intact
between
the
russian
and
french
forces
the
refreshment
room
and
the
hall
footmen
were
bustling
about
with
wine
and
viands
groups
singers
stood
outside
the
windows
the
officer
was
admitted
and
immediately
saw
all
the
chief
generals
the
army
together
and
among
them
ermolov
big
imposing
figure
they
all
had
their
coats
unbuttoned
and
were
standing
semicircle
with
flushed
and
animated
faces
laughing
loudly
the
middle
the
room
short
handsome
general
with
red
face
was
dancing
the
trepak
with
much
spirit
and
agility
bravo
nicholas
ivanych
the
officer
felt
that
arriving
with
important
orders
such
moment
was
doubly
blame
and
would
have
preferred
wait
but
one
the
generals
espied
him
and
hearing
what
had
come
about
informed
ermolov
ermolov
came
forward
with
frown
his
face
and
hearing
what
the
officer
had
say
took
the
papers
from
him
without
word
you
think
went
off
just
chance
said
comrade
who
was
the
staff
that
evening
the
officer
the
horse
guards
referring
ermolov
was
trick
was
done

get
konovnitsyn
into
trouble
you
see
what
mess
there
tomorrow
chapter
next
day
the
decrepit
kutuzov
having
given
orders
called
early
said
his
prayers
dressed
and
with
unpleasant
consciousness
having
direct
battle
did
not
approve
got
into
his
caleche
and
drove
from
letashovka
village
three
and
half
miles
from
tarutino
the
place
where
the
attacking
columns
were
meet
sat
the
caleche
dozing
and
waking
turns
and
listening
for
any
sound
firing
the
right
indication
that
the
action
had
begun
but
all
was
still
quiet
damp
dull
autumn
morning
was
just
dawning
approaching
tarutino
kutuzov
noticed
cavalrymen
leading
their
horses
water
across
the
road
along
which
was
driving
kutuzov
looked
them
searchingly
stopped
his
carriage
and
inquired
what
regiment
they
belonged
they
belonged
column
that
should
have
been
far
front
and
ambush
long
before
then
may
mistake
thought
the
old
commander
chief
but
little
further
saw
infantry
regiments
with
their
arms
piled
and
the
soldiers
only
partly
dressed
eating
their
rye
porridge
and
carrying
fuel
sent
for
officer
the
officer
reported
that
order
advance
had
been
received
how
not
rec
kutuzov
began
but
checked
himself
immediately
and
sent
for
senior
officer
getting
out
his
caleche
waited
with
drooping
head
and
breathing
heavily
pacing
silently
and
down
when
eykhen
the
officer
the
general
staff
whom
had
summoned
appeared
kutuzov
went
purple
the
face
not
because
that
officer
was
blame
for
the
mistake
but
because
was
object
sufficient
importance
for
him
vent
his
wrath
trembling
and
panting
the
old
man
fell
into
that
state
fury
which
sometimes
used
roll
the
ground
and
fell
upon
eykhen
threatening
him
with
his
hands
shouting
and
loading
him
with
gross
abuse
another
man
captain
brozin
who
happened
turn
and
who
was
not
all
blame
suffered
the
same
fate
what
sort
another
blackguard
are
you
have
you
shot
scoundrels
yelled
kutuzov
hoarse
voice
waving
his
arms
and
reeling
was
suffering
physically
the
commander
chief
serene
highness
who
everybody
said
possessed
powers
such
man
had
ever
had
russia
placed
this
position
made
the
laughingstock
the
whole
army
needn
have
been
such
hurry
pray
about
today
have
kept
awake
thinking
everything
over
all
night
thought
himself
when
was
chit
officer
one
would
have
dared
mock
and
now
was
state
physical
suffering
from
corporal
punishment
and
could
not
avoid
expressing
cries
anger
and
distress
but
his
strength
soon
began
fail
him
and
looking
about
him
conscious
having
said
much
that
was
amiss
again
got
into
his
caleche
and
drove
back
silence
his
wrath
once
expended
did
not
return
and
blinking
feebly
listened
excuses
and
self
justifications
ermolov
did
not
come
see
him
till
the
next
day
and
the
insistence
bennigsen
konovnitsyn
and
toll
that
the
movement
that
had
miscarried
should
executed
next
day
and
once
more
kutuzov
had
consent
chapter
next
day
the
troops
assembled
their
appointed
places
the
evening
and
advanced
during
the
night
was
autumn
night
with
dark
purple
clouds
but
rain
the
ground
was
damp
but
not
muddy
and
the
troops
advanced
noiselessly
only
occasionally
jingling
the
artillery
could
faintly
heard
the
men
were
forbidden
talk
out
loud
smoke
their
pipes
strike
light
and
they
tried
prevent
their
horses
neighing
the
secrecy
the
undertaking
heightened
its
charm
and
they
marched
gaily
some
columns
supposing
they
had
reached
their
destination
halted
piled
arms
and
settled
down
the
cold
ground
but
the
majority
marched
all
night
and
arrived
places
where
they
evidently
should
not
have
been
only
count
orlov
denisov
with
his
cossacks
the
least
important
detachment
all
got
his
appointed
place
the
right
time
this
detachment
halted
the
outskirts
forest
the
path
leading
from
the
village
stromilova
dmitrovsk
toward
dawn
count
orlov
denisov
who
had
dozed
off
was
awakened
deserter
from
the
french
army
being
brought
him
this
was
polish
sergeant
poniatowski
corps
who
explained
polish
that
had
come
over
because
had
been
slighted
the
service
that
ought
long
ago
have
been
made
officer
that
was
braver
than
any
them
and
had
left
them
and
wished
pay
them
out
said
that
murat
was
spending
the
night
less
than
mile
from
where
they
were
and
that
they
would
let
him
have
convoy
hundred
men
would
capture
him
alive
count
orlov
denisov
consulted
his
fellow
officers
the
offer
was
too
tempting
refused
everyone
volunteered
and
everybody
advised
making
the
attempt
after
much
disputing
and
arguing
major
general
grekov
with
two
cossack
regiments
decided
with
the
polish
sergeant
now
remember
said
count
orlov
denisov
the
sergeant
parting
you
have
been
lying
have
you
hanged
like
dog
but
true
you
shall
have
hundred
gold
pieces
without
replying
the
sergeant
with
resolute
air
mounted
and
rode
away
with
grekov
whose
men
had
quickly
assembled
they
disappeared
into
the
forest
and
count
orlov
denisov
having
seen
grekov
off
returned
shivering
from
the
freshness
the
early
dawn
and
excited
what
had
undertaken
his
own
responsibility
and
began
looking
the
enemy
camp
now
just
visible
the
deceptive
light
dawn
and
the
dying
campfires
our
columns
ought
have
begun
appear
open
declivity
his
right
looked
that
direction
but
though
the
columns
would
have
been
visible
quite
far
off
they
were
not
seen
seemed
the
count
that
things
were
beginning
stir
the
french
camp
and
his
keen
sighted
adjutant
confirmed
this
really
too
late
said
count
orlov
looking
the
camp
often
happens
when
someone
have
trusted
longer
before
our
eyes
suddenly
seemed
quite
clear
and
obvious
him
that
the
sergeant
was
impostor
that
had
lied
and
that
the
whole
russian
attack
would
ruined
the
absence
those
two
regiments
which
would
lead
away
heaven
only
knew
where
how
could
one
capture
commander
chief
from
among
such
mass
troops
sure
that
rascal
was
lying
said
the
count
they
can
still
called
back
said
one
his
suite
who
like
count
orlov
felt
distrustful
the
adventure
when
looked
the
enemy
camp
really
what
you
think
should
let
them
not
will
you
have
them
fetched
back
fetch
them
back
fetch
them
back
said
count
orlov
with
sudden
determination
looking
his
watch
will
too
late
quite
light
and
the
adjutant
galloped
through
the
forest
after
grekov
when
grekov
returned
count
orlov
denisov
excited
both
the
abandoned
attempt
and
vainly
awaiting
the
infantry
columns
that
still
did
not
appear
well
the
proximity
the
enemy
resolved
advance
all
his
men
felt
the
same
excitement
mount
commanded
whisper
the
men
took
their
places
and
crossed
themselves
forward
with
god
aid
hurrah
reverberated
the
forest
and
the
cossack
companies
trailing
their
lances
and
advancing
one
after
another
poured
out
sack
dashed
gaily
across
the
brook
toward
the
camp
one
desperate
frightened
yell
from
the
first
french
soldier
who
saw
the
cossacks
and
all
who
were
the
camp
undressed
and
only
just
waking
ran
off
all
directions
abandoning
cannons
muskets
and
horses
had
the
cossacks
pursued
the
french
without
heeding
what
was
behind
and
around
them
they
would
have
captured
murat
and
everything
there
that
was
what
the
officers
desired
but
was
impossible
make
the
cossacks
budge
when
once
they
had
got
booty
and
prisoners
none
them
listened
orders
fifteen
hundred
prisoners
and
thirty
eight
guns
were
taken
the
spot
besides
standards
and
what
seemed
most
important
the
cossacks
horses
saddles
horsecloths
and
the
like
all
this
had
dealt
with
the
prisoners
and
guns
secured
the
booty
divided
not
without
some
shouting
and
even
little
fighting
among
themselves
and
was
this
that
the
cossacks
all
busied
themselves
the
french
not
being
farther
pursued
began
recover
themselves
they
formed
into
detachments
and
began
firing
orlov
denisov
still
waiting
for
the
other
columns
arrive
advanced
further
meantime
according
the
dispositions
which
said
that
the
first
column
will
march
and
the
infantry
the
belated
columns
commanded
bennigsen
and
directed
toll
had
started
due
order
and
always
happens
had
got
somewhere
but
not
their
appointed
places
always
happens
the
men
starting
cheerfully
began
halt
murmurs
were
heard
there
was
sense
confusion
and
finally
backward
movement
adjutants
and
generals
galloped
about
shouted
grew
angry
quarreled
said
they
had
come
quite
wrong
and
were
late
gave
vent
little
abuse
and
last
gave
all
and
went
forward
simply
get
somewhere
shall
get
somewhere
other
and
they
did

this

assiduously
from

upside

when
was
already
broad
daylight

the

should
long
before
have
joined

denisov
excited
and
vexed
the
failure
and
supposing
that
someone
must
responsible
for
toll
galloped
the
commander
the
corps
and
began
upbraiding
him
severely
saying
that
ought
shot
general
bagovut
fighting
old
soldier
placid
temperament
being
also
upset
all
the
delay
confusion

cross

fell
into

everybody
surprise
and
quite
contrary
his
usual
character
and
said
disagreeable
things
toll
prefer
not
take
lessons
from
anyone
but
can
die
with
men
well
anybody
said
and
advanced
with
single
division
coming
out
onto
field
under
the
enemy
fire
this
brave
general
went
straight
ahead
leading
his
men
under
fire
without
considering
his
agitation
whether
going
into
action
now
with
single
division
would
any
use
danger
cannon
balls
and
bullets
were
just
what
needed
his
angry
mood
one
the
first
bullets
killed
him
and
other
bullets
killed
many
his
men
and
his
division
remained
under
fire
for
some
time
quite
uselessly
chapter

meanwhile
another
column
was
have
attacked
the
french
from
the
front
but
kutuzov
accompanied
that
column
well
knew
that
nothing
but
confusion
would
come
this
battle
undertaken
against
his
will
and
far
was
his
power
held
the
troops
back
did
not
advance
rode
silently
his
small
gray
horse
indolently
answering
suggestions
that
they
should
attack
the
word
attack
always
your
tongue
but
you
don
see
that
are
unable
execute
complicated
maneuvers
said
miloradovich
who
asked
permission
advance
couldn
take
murat
prisoner
this
morning
get
the
place
time
and
nothing
can
done
now
replied
someone
else
when
kutuzov
was
informed
that
the
french
rear
where
according
the
reports
the
cossacks
there
had
previously
been
nobody
there
were
now
two
battalions
poles
gave
sidelong
glance
ermolov
who
was
behind
him
and
whom
had
not
spoken
since
the
previous
day
you
see
they
are
asking
attack
and
making
plans
all
kinds
but
soon
one
gets
business
nothing
ready
and
the
enemy
forewarned
takes
measures
accordingly
ermolov
screwed
his
eyes
and
smiled
faintly
hearing
these
words
understood
that
for
him
the
storm
had
blown
over
and
that
kutuzov
would
content
himself
with
that
hint
having
little
fun
expense
said
ermolov
softly
nudging
with
his
knee
raevski
who
was
his
side
soon
after
this
ermolov
moved
kutuzov
and
respectfully
remarked
not
too
late
yet
your
highness
the
enemy
has
not
gone
away
you
were
order
attack
not
the
guards
will
not
much
see
little
smoke
kutuzov
did
not
reply
but
when
they
reported
him
that
murat
troops
were
retreat
ordered
advance
though
every
hundred
paces
halted
for
three
quarters
hour
the
whole
battle
consisted
what
orlov
denisov
cossacks
had
done
the
rest
the
army
merely
lost
some
hundreds
men
uselessly
consequence
this
battle
kutuzov
received
diamond
decoration
and
bennigsen
some
diamonds
and
hundred
thousand
rubles
others
also
received
pleasant
recognitions
corresponding
their
various
grades
and
following
the
battle
fresh
changes
were
made
the
staff
that
how
everything
done
with
all
topsy
turvy
said
the
russian
officers
and
generals
after
the
tarutino
battle

that
some
fool
there
doing
things
all
wrong
but
that
ourselves
should
not
have
done

speak
today

where

the
descriptions
given
historians

french
ones
find
their
wars
and
battles
carried
out
accordance
with
previously
formed
plans
the
only
conclusion
drawn
that
those
descriptions
are
false
the
battle
tarutino
obviously
did
not
attain
the
aim
toll
had
view
lead
the
troops
into
action
the
order
prescribed
the
dispositions
nor
that
which
count
orlov
denisov
may
have
had

take
murat

nor
the
result
immediately
destroying
the
whole
corps
which
bennigsen
and
others
may
have
had
view
nor
the
aim
the
officer
who
wished
into
action
distinguish
himself
nor
that
the
cossack
who
wanted
more
booty
than
got
and
but
the
aim
the
battle
was
what
actually
resulted
and
what
all
the
russians
that
day
desired
drive
the
french
out
russia
and
destroy
their
army
quite
clear
that
the
battle
tarutino
just
because
its
incongruities
was
exactly
what
was
wanted
that
stage
the
campaign
would
difficult
and
even
impossible
imagine
any
result
more
opportune
than
the
actual
outcome
this
battle
with
minimum
effort
and
insignificant
losses
despite
the
greatest
confusion
the
most
important
results
the

were
attained

short
special
genius
would
seem
required
retain
the
brilliant
position
the
french
held
that
time
for
that
only
very
simple
and
easy
steps
were
necessary
not
allow
the
troops
loot
prepare
winter
clothing
which
there
was
sufficient
moscow
for
the
whole
army
and
methodically
collect
the
provisions
which
according
the
french
historians
there
were
enough
moscow
supply
the
whole
army
for
six
months
yet
napoleon
that
greatest
all
geniuses
who
the
historians
declare
had
control
the
army
took
none
these
steps
not
merely
did
nothing
the
kind
but
the
contrary
used
his
power
select
the
most
foolish
and
ruinous
all
the
courses
open
him
all
that
napoleon
might
have
done
wintering

advancing

nizhni

retiring
more
northerly
more
southerly
route
say
the
road
kutuzov
afterwards
took
nothing
more
stupid
disastrous
can
imagined
than
what
actually
did
remained
moscow
till
october
letting
the
troops
plunder
the
city
then
hesitating
whether
leave
garrison
behind
him
quitted
moscow
approached
kutuzov
without
joining
battle
turned
the
right
and
reached
malo
yaroslavets
again
without
attempting
break
through
and
take
the
road
kutuzov
took
but
retiring
instead
mozhaysk
along
the
devastated
smolensk
road
nothing
more
stupid
than
that
could
have
been
devised
more
disastrous
for
the
army
the
sequel
showed
had
napoleon
aim
been
destroy
his
army
the
most
skillful
strategist
could
hardly
have
devised
any
series
actions
that
would
completely
have
accomplished
that
purpose
independently
anything
the
russian
army
might
napoleon
the
man
genius
did
this
but
say
that
destroyed
his
army
because
wished
because
was
very
stupid
would
unjust
say
that
had
brought
his
troops
moscow
because
wished
and
because
was
very
clever
and
genius
both
cases
his
personal
activity
having
more
force
than
the
personal
activity
any
soldier
merely
coincided
with
the
laws
that
guided
the
event
the
historians
quite
falsely
represent
napoleon
faculties
having
weakened
moscow
and
only
because
the
results
did
not
justify
his
actions
employed
all
his
ability
and
strength
the
best
could
for
himself
and
his
army
had
done
previously
and
did
subsequently
his
activity
that
time
was
less
astounding
than
was
egypt
italy
austria
and
prussia
not
know
for

how
far
his

was

where
forty
centuries

down
upon

there
are
all

the
incomprehensible
surrender

without
fighting

must
incline

the
only
explanation
the

thank
god
have
need
recognize

paid
for
the

the

napoleon
and
his

napoleon
under
pressure
from
his

did
the

thing
the
rustle
the

tarutino
frightened
the
beast
and
rushed
forward

him
turned

and
finally
like
any
wild

ran
back
along
the
most
disadvantageous
and
dangerous
path

the
old

was
familiar
during
the
whole

period
napoleon

seems
have
been
the

these

chapter
early
the
morning
the
sixth

went
out
the

and
returning
stopped
the

play
with
little
blue
gray
dog
with
long
body
and
short
bandy
legs
that
jumped
about
him
this
little
dog
lived
their
shed
sleeping
beside
karataev
night
sometimes
made
excursions
into
the
town
but
always
returned
again
probably
had
never
had
owner
and
still
belonged
nobody
and
had
name
the
french
called
azor
the
soldier
who
told
stories
called
femgalka
karataev
and
others
called
gray
sometimes
flabby
its
lack
master
name
even
breed
any
definite
color
did
not
seem
trouble
the
blue
gray
dog
the
least
its
furry
tail
stood
firm
and
round
plume
its
bandy
legs
served
well
that
would
often
gracefully
lift
hind
leg
and
run
very
easily
and
quickly
three
legs
disdaining
use
all
four
everything
pleased
now
would
roll
its

with
delight

bask
the

tied
with

round
the
ankles
for
warmth
and
peasant

physically
had
changed
much
during
this
time
longer
seemed
stout
though
still
had
the
appearance
solidity
and
strength
hereditary
his
family
beard
and
mustache
covered
the
lower
part
his
face
and
tangle
hair
infested
with
lice
curled
round
his
head
like
cap
the
look
his
eyes
was
resolute
calm
and
animatedly
alert
never
before
the
former
slackness
which
had
shown
itself
even
his
eyes
was
now
replaced
energetic
readiness
for
action
and
resistance
his
feet
were
bare
pierre
first
looked
down
the
field
across
which
vehicles
and
horsemen
were
passing
that
morning
then
into
the
distance
across
the
river
then
the
dog
who
was
pretending
earnest
about
biting
him
and
then
his
bare
feet
which
placed
with
pleasure
various
positions
moving
his
dirty
thick
big
toes
every
time
looked
his
bare
feet
smile
animated
self
satisfaction
flitted
across
his
face
the
sight
them
reminded
him
all
had
experienced
and
learned
during
these
weeks
and
this
recollection
was
pleasant
him
for
some
days
the
weather
had
been
calm
and
clear
with
slight
frosts
the
mornings
what
called
old
wives
summer
the
sunshine
the
air
was
warm
and
that
warmth
was
particularly
pleasant
with
the
invigorating
freshness
the
morning
frost
still
the
air
everything
far
and
near
lay
the
magic
crystal
glitter
seen
only
that
time
autumn
the
sparrow
hills
were
visible
the
distance
with
the
village
the
church
and
the
large
white
house
the
bare
trees
the
sand
the
bricks
and
roofs
the
houses
the
green
church
spire
and
the
corners
the
white
house
the
distance
all
stood
out
the
transparent
air
most
delicate
outline
and
with
unnatural
clearness
near
could
seen
the
familiar
ruins
half
burned
mansion
occupied
the
french
with
lilac
bushes
still
showing
dark
green
beside
the
fence
and
even
that
ruined
and
befouled
house
which
dull
weather
was
repulsively
ugly
seemed
quietly
beautiful
now
the
clear
motionless
brilliance
french
corporal
with
coat
unbuttoned
homely
way
skullcap
his
head
and
short
pipe
his
mouth
came
from
behind
corner
the
shed
and
approached
pierre
with
friendly
wink
what
sunshine
monsieur
kiril
their
name
for
pierre
just
like
spring
and
the
corporal
leaned
against
the
door
and
offered
pierre
his
pipe
though
whenever
offered
pierre
always
declined
the
march
such
weather
began
pierre
inquired
what
was
being
said
about
leaving
and
the
corporal
told
him
that
nearly
all
the
troops
were
starting
and
there
ought
order
about
the
prisoners
that
day
sokolov
one
the
soldiers
the
shed
with
pierre
was
dying
and
pierre
told
the
corporal
that
something
should
done
about
him
the
corporal
replied
that
pierre
need
not
worry
about
that
they
had
ambulance
and
permanent
hospital
and
arrangements
would
made
for
the
sick
and
that
general
everything
that
could
happen
had
been
foreseen
the
authorities
besides
monsieur
kiril

only

monsieur
kiril
the
other
day
had
not
been
for
you
that
affair
would
have
ended
ill
and
after
chatting
while
longer
the
corporal
went
away
the
affair
had
alluded
had
happened
few
days
before
fight
between
the
prisoners
and
the
french
soldiers
which
pierre
had
succeeded
pacifying
his
comrades
some
the
prisoners
who
had
heard
pierre
talking
the
corporal
immediately
asked
what
the
frenchman
had
said
while
pierre
was
repeating
what
had
been
told
about
the
army
leaving
moscow
thin
sallow
tattered
french
soldier
came
the
door
the
shed
rapidly
and
timidly
raising
his
fingers
his
forehead
way
greeting
asked
pierre
whether
the
soldier
platoche
whom
had
given
shirt
sew
was
that
shed
week
before
the
french
had
had
boot
leather
and
linen
issued
them
which
they
had
given
out
the
prisoners
make
into
boots
and
shirts
for
them
ready
ready
dear
fellow
said
karataev
coming
out
with
neatly
folded
shirt
karataev
account
the
warm
weather
and
for
convenience
work
was
wearing
only
trousers
and
tattered
shirt
black
soot
his
hair
was
bound
round
workman
fashion
with
wisp
lime
tree
bast
and
his
round
face
seemed
rounder
and
pleasanter
than
ever
promise
own
brother
performance
said
friday
and
here
ready
said
platon
smiling
and
unfolding
the
shirt
had
sewn
the
frenchman
glanced
around
uneasily
and
then
overcoming
his
hesitation
rapidly
threw
off
his
uniform
and
put
the
shirt
had
long
greasy
flowered
silk
waistcoat
next
his
sallow
thin
bare
body
but
shirt
was
evidently
afraid
the
prisoners
looking
would
laugh
him
and
thrust
his
head
into
the
shirt
hurriedly
none
the
prisoners
said
word
see
fits
well
platon
kept
repeating
pulling
the
shirt
straight
the
frenchman
having
pushed
his
head
and
hands
through
without
raising
his
eyes
looked
down
the
shirt
and
examined
the
seams
you
see
dear
man
this
not
sewing
shop
and
had
proper
tools
and
they
say
one
needs
tool
even
kill
louse
said
platon
with
one
his
round
smiles
obviously
pleased
with
his
work
good
quite
good
thank
you
said
the
frenchman
french
but
there
must
some
linen
left
over
will
fit
better
still
when
sets
your
body
said
karataev
still
admiring
his
handiwork
you
nice
and
comfortable
thanks
thanks
old
fellow
but
the
bits
left
over
said
the
frenchman
again
and
smiled
took
out
assignation
ruble
note
and
gave
karataev
but
give
the
pieces
that
are
over
pierre
saw
that
platon
did
not
want
understand
what
the
frenchman
was
saying
and
looked
without
interfering
karataev
thanked
the
frenchman
for
the
money
and
went
admiring
his
own
work
the
frenchman
insisted
having
the
pieces
returned
that
were
left
over
and
asked
pierre
translate
what
said
what
does
want
the
bits
for
said
karataev
they
make
fine
leg
bands
for
well
never
mind
and
karataev
with
suddenly
changed
and
saddened
expression
took
small
bundle
scraps
from
inside
his
shirt
and
gave
the
frenchman
without
looking
him
dear
muttered
karataev
and
went
away
the
frenchman
looked
the
linen
considered
for
moment
then
looked
inquiringly
pierre
and
pierre
look
had
told
him
something
suddenly
blushed
and
shouted
squeaky
voice
platoche
platoche
keep
them
yourself
and
handing
back
the
odd
bits
turned
and
went
out
there
look
that
said
karataev
swaying
his
head
people
said
they
were
not
christians
but
they
too
have
souls
what
the
old
folk
used
say
sweating
hand
open
hand
dry
hand
close
naked
but
yet
given
back
karataev
smiled
thoughtfully
and
was
silent
awhile
looking
the
pieces
but
they
make
grand
leg
bands
dear
friend
said
and
went
back
into
the
shed
chapter
xii
four
weeks
had
passed
since
pierre
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
though
the
french
had
offered
move
him
from
the
men
the
officers
shed
had
stayed
the
shed
where
was
first
put
burned
and
devastated
moscow
pierre
experienced
almost
the
extreme
limits
privation
man
can
endure
but
thanks
his
physical
strength
and
health
which
had
till
then
been
unconscious
and
thanks
especially
the
fact
that
the
privations
came
gradually
that
was
impossible
say
when
they
began
endured
his
position
not
only
lightly
but
joyfully
and
just
this
time
obtained
the
tranquillity
and
ease
mind
had
formerly
striven
vain
reach
had
long
sought
different
ways
that
tranquillity
mind
that
inner
harmony
which
had
impressed
him
the
soldiers
the
battle
borodino
had
sought
philanthropy
freemasonry
the
dissipations
town
life
wine
heroic
feats
self
sacrifice
and
romantic
love
for
natasha
had
sought
reasoning
and
all
these
quests
and
experiments
had
failed
him
and
now
without
thinking
about
had
found
that
peace
and
inner
harmony
only
through
the
horror
death
through
privation
and
through
what
recognized
karataev
those
dreadful
moments
had
lived
through
the
executions
had
were
forever
washed
away
from
his
imagination
and
memory
the
agitating
thoughts
and
feelings
that
had
formerly
seemed
important
did
not
now
occur
him
think
russia
the
war
politics
napoleon
was
plain
him
that
all
these
things
were
business
his
and
that
was
not
called
judge
concerning
them
and
therefore
could
not
russia
and
summer
weather
are
not
bound
together
thought
repeating
words
karataev
which
found
strangely
consoling
his
intention
killing
napoleon
and
his
calculations
the
cabalistic
number
the
beast
the
apocalypse
now
seemed
him
meaningless
and
even
ridiculous
his
anger
with
his
wife
and
anxiety
that
his
name
should
not
smirched
now
seemed
not
merely
trivial
but
even
amusing
what
concern
was
his
that
somewhere
other
that
woman
was
leading
the
life
she
preferred
what
did
matter
anybody
and
especially
him
whether
not
they
found
out
that
their
prisoner
name
was
count
bezukhov
now
often
remembered
his
conversation
with
prince
andrew
and
quite
agreed
with
him
though
understood
prince
andrew
thoughts
somewhat
differently
prince
andrew
had
thought
and
said
that
happiness
could
only
negative
but
had
said
with
shade
bitterness
and
irony
though
was
really
saying
that
all
desire
for
positive
happiness
implanted
merely
torment
and
never
satisfied
but
pierre
believed
without
any
mental
reservation
the
absence
suffering
the
satisfaction
one
needs
and
consequent
freedom
the
choice
one
occupation
that
one
way
life
now
seemed
pierre
indubitably
man
highest
happiness
here
and
now
for
the
first
time
fully
appreciated
the
enjoyment
eating
when
wanted
eat
drinking
when
wanted
drink
sleeping
when
wanted
sleep
warmth
when
was
cold
talking
fellow
man
when
wished
talk
and
hear
human
voice
the
satisfaction
one
needs
good
food
cleanliness
and
freedom
now
that
was
deprived
all
this
seemed
pierre
constitute
perfect
happiness
and
the
choice
occupation
that
his
way
life
now
that
that
was
restricted
seemed
him
such
easy
matter
that
forgot
that
superfluity
the
comforts
life
destroys
all
joy
satisfying
one
needs
while
great
freedom
the
choice
occupation
such
freedom
his
wealth
his
education
and
his
social
position
had
given
him
his
own
life
just
what
makes
the
choice
occupation
insolubly
difficult
and
destroys
the
desire
and
possibility
having
occupation
all
pierre
daydreams
now
turned
the
time
when
would
free
yet
subsequently
and
for
the
rest
his
life
thought
and
spoke
with
enthusiasm
that
month
captivity
those
irrecoverable
strong
joyful
sensations
and
chiefly
the
complete
peace
mind
and
inner
freedom
which
experienced
only
during
those
weeks
when
the
first
day
got
early
went
out
the
shed
dawn
and
saw
the
cupolas
and
crosses
the
new
convent
the
virgin
still
dark
first
the
hoarfrost
the
dusty
grass
the
sparrow
hills
and
the
wooded
banks
above
the
winding
river
vanishing
the
purple
distance
when
felt
the
contact
the
fresh
air
and
heard
the
noise
the
crows
flying
from
moscow
across
the
field
and
when
afterwards
light
gleamed
from
the
east
and
the
sun
rim
appeared
solemnly
from
behind
cloud
and
the
cupolas
and
crosses
the
hoarfrost
the
distance
and
the
river
all
began
sparkle
the
glad
light
pierre
felt
new
joy
and
strength
life
such
had
never
before
known
and
this
not
only
stayed
with
him
during
the
whole
his
imprisonment
but
even
grew
strength
the
hardships
his
position
increased
that
feeling
alertness
and
readiness
for
anything
was
still
further
strengthened
him
the
high
opinion
his
fellow
prisoners
formed
him
soon
after
his
arrival
the
shed
with
his
knowledge
languages
the
respect
shown
him
the
french
his
simplicity
his
readiness
give
anything
asked
him
received
the
allowance
three
rubles
week
made
officers
with
his
strength
which
showed
the
soldiers
pressing
nails
into
the
walls
the
hut
his
gentleness
his
companions
and
his
capacity
for
sitting
still
and
thinking
without
doing
anything
which
seemed
them
incomprehensible
appeared
them
rather
mysterious
and
superior
being
the
very
qualities
that
had
been
hindrance
not
actually
harmful
him
the
world
had
lived
his
strength
his
disdain
for
the
comforts
life
his
absent
mindedness
and
simplicity
here
among
these
people
gave
him
almost
the
status
hero
and
pierre
felt
that
their
opinion
placed
responsibilities
upon
him
chapter
xiii
the
french
evacuation
began
the
night
between
the
sixth
and
seventh
october
kitchens
and
sheds
were
dismantled
carts
loaded
and
troops
and
baggage
trains
started
seven
the
morning
french
convoy
marching
trim
wearing
shakos
and
carrying
muskets
knapsacks
and
enormous
sacks
stood
front
the
sheds
and
animated
french
talk
mingled
with
curses
sounded
all
along
the
lines
the
shed
everyone
was
ready
dressed
belted
shod
and
only
awaited
the
order
start
the
sick
soldier
sokolov
pale
and
thin
with
dark
shadows
round
his
eyes
alone
sat
his
place
barefoot
and
not
dressed
his
eyes
prominent
from
the
emaciation
his
face
gazed
inquiringly
his
comrades
who
were
paying
attention
him
and
moaned
regularly
and
quietly
was
evidently
not
much
his
sufferings
that
caused
him
moan
had
dysentery
his
fear
and
grief
being
left
alone
pierre
girt
with
rope
round
his
waist
and
wearing
shoes
karataev
had
made
for
him
from
some
leather
french
soldier
had
torn
off
tea
chest
and
brought
have
his
boots
mended
with
went
the
sick
man
and
squatted
down
beside
him
you
know
sokolov
they
are
not
all
going
away
they
have
hospital
here
you
may
better
off
than
others
said
pierre
lord
will
the
death
lord
moaned
the
man
louder
voice
and
ask
them
again
directly
said
pierre
rising
and
going
the
door
the
shed
just
pierre
reached
the
door
the
corporal
who
had
offered
him
pipe
the
day
before
came
with
two
soldiers
the
corporal
and
soldiers
were
marching
kit
with
knapsacks
and
shakos
that
had
metal
straps
and
these
changed
their
familiar
faces
the
corporal
came
according
orders
shut
the
door
the
prisoners
had
counted
before
being
let
out
corporal
what
will
they
with
the
sick
man
pierre
began
but
even
spoke
began
doubt
whether
this
was
the
corporal
knew
stranger
unlike
himself
did
the
corporal
seem
that
moment
moreover
just
pierre
was
speaking
sharp
rattle
drums
was
suddenly
heard
from
both
sides
the
corporal
frowned
pierre
words
and
uttering
some
meaningless
oaths
slammed
the
door
the
shed
became
semidark
and
the
sharp
rattle
the
drums
two
sides
drowned
the
sick
man
groans
there
again
said
pierre
himself
and
involuntary
shudder
ran
down
his
spine
the
corporal
changed
face
the
sound
his
voice
the
stirring
and
deafening
noise
the
drums
recognized
that
mysterious
callous
force
which
compelled
people
against
their
will
kill
their
fellow
men
that
force
the
effect
which
had
witnessed
during
the
executions
fear
try
escape
that
force
address
entreaties
exhortations
those
who
served
its
tools
was
useless
pierre
knew
this
now
one
had
wait
and
endure
did
not
again
the
sick
man
nor
turn
look
him
but
stood
frowning
the
door
the
hut
when
that
door
was
opened
and
the
prisoners
crowding
against
one
another
like
flock
sheep
squeezed
into
the
exit
pierre
pushed
his
way
forward
and
approached
that
very
captain
who
the
corporal
had
assured
him
was
ready
anything
for
him
the
captain
was
also
marching
kit
and
his
cold
face
appeared
that
same
which
pierre
had
recognized
the
corporal
words
and
the
roll
the
drums
pass
pass
the
captain
reiterated
frowning
sternly
and
looking
the
prisoners
who
thronged
past
him
pierre
went
him
though
knew
his
attempt
would
vain
what
now
the
officer
asked
with
cold
look
not
recognizing
pierre
pierre
told
him
about
the
sick
man
manage
walk
devil
take
him
said
the
captain
pass
pass
continued
without
looking
pierre
but
dying
pierre
again
began
good
shouted
the
captain
frowning
angrily
dram
dam
dam
dam
rattled
the
drums
and
pierre
understood
that
this
mysterious
force
completely
controlled
these
men
and
that
was
now
useless
say
any
more
the
officer
prisoners
were
separated
from
the
soldiers
and
told
march
front
there
were
about
thirty
officers
with
pierre
among
them
and
about
three
hundred
men
the
officers
who
had
come
from
the
other
sheds
were
all
strangers
pierre
and
much
better
dressed
than
they
looked
him
and
his
shoes
mistrustfully
alien
not
far
from
him
walked
fat
major
with
sallow
bloated
angry
face
who
was
wearing
kazan
dressing
gown
tied
round
with
towel
and
who
evidently
enjoyed
the
respect
his
fellow
prisoners
kept
one
hand
which
clasped
his
tobacco
pouch
inside
the
bosom
his
dressing
gown
and
held
the
stem
his
pipe
firmly
with
the
other
panting
and
puffing
the
major
grumbled
and
growled
everybody
because
thought
was
being
pushed
and
that
they
were
all
hurrying
when
they
had
nowhere
hurry
and
were
all
surprised
something
when
there
was
nothing
surprised
another
thin
little
officer
was
speaking
everyone
conjecturing
where
they
were
now
being
taken
and
how
far
they
would
get
that
day
official
felt
boots
and
wearing
commissariat
uniform
ran
round
from
side
side
and
gazed
the
ruins
moscow
loudly
announcing
his
observations
what
had
been
burned
down
and
what
this
that
part
the
city
was
that
they
could
see
third
officer
who
his
accent
was
pole
disputed
with
the
commissariat
officer
arguing
that
was
mistaken
his
identification
the
different
wards
moscow
what
are
you
disputing
about
said
the
major
angrily
what
does
matter
whether
nicholas

down
and
there
end
what
are
you
pushing
for

not
pushing

all
what
have
they
done
the
prisoners
one
side
and
another
were
heard
saying
they
gazed
the
charred
ruins
all
beyond
the
river

zubova
and
the
kremlin
just

the

they
passed
near
church
the
khamovniki
one
the
few
unburned
quarters
moscow
the
whole
mass
prisoners
suddenly
started
one
side
and
exclamations
horror
and
disgust
were
heard
the
villains
what
heathens
yes
dead
dead
and
smeared
with
something
pierre
too
drew
near
the
church
where
the
thing
was
that
evoked
these
exclamations
and
dimly
made
out
something
leaning
against
the
palings
surrounding
the
church
from
the
words
his
comrades
who
saw
better
than
did
found
that
this
was
the
body
man
set
upright
against
the
palings
with
its
face
smeared
with
soot
what
the
devil
thirty
thousand
devils
the
convoy

began
cursing
and
the
french
soldiers
with
fresh
virulence
drove

their
swords

the

endless

steps
forward

and
again
moved
and
from
all
sides
vehicles
and
men
crowded
closer
and
closer
together
they
advanced
the
few
hundred
paces
that
separated
the
bridge
from
the
kaluga
road
taking
more
than
hour
and
came
out
upon
the
square
where
the
streets
the
transmoskva
ward
and
the
kaluga
road
converge
and
the
prisoners
jammed
close
together
had
stand
for
some
hours

and
incessant
shouts
anger
and
abuse

pressed
against

noise
which
mingled

imagination
with
the
roll

drums

climbed
onto
the

again
the
church
khamovniki
wave
general
curiosity
bore
all
the
prisoners
forward
onto
the
road
and
pierre
thanks
his
stature
saw
over
the
heads
the
others
what
attracted
their
curiosity
three
carriages
involved
among
the
munition
carts
closely
squeezed
together
sat
women
with
rouged
faces
dressed
glaring
colors
who
were
shouting
something
shrill
voices
from
the
moment
pierre
had
recognized
the
appearance
the
mysterious
force
nothing
had
seemed
him
strange
dreadful
neither
the
corpse
smeared
with
soot
for
fun
nor
these
women
hurrying
away
nor
the
burned
ruins
moscow
all
that
now
witnessed
scarcely
made
impression
him
his
soul
making
ready
for
hard
struggle
refused
receive
impressions
that
might
weaken
the
women
vehicles
drove
behind
them
came
more
carts
soldiers
wagons
soldiers
gun
carriages
carriages
soldiers
ammunition
carts
more
soldiers
and
now
and
then
women
pierre
did
not
see
the
people
individuals
but
saw
their
movement
all
these
people
and
horses
seemed
driven
forward
some
invisible
power
during
the
hour
pierre
watched
them
they
all
came
flowing
from
the
different
streets
with
one
and
the
same
desire
get
quickly
they
all
jostled
one
another
began
grow
angry
and
fight
white
teeth
gleamed
brows
frowned
ever
the
same
words
abuse
flew
from
side
side
and
all
the
faces
bore
the
same
swaggeringly
resolute
and
coldly
cruel
expression
that
had
struck
pierre
that
morning
the
corporal
face
when
the
drums
were
beating
was
not
till
nearly
evening
that
the
officer
commanding
the
escort
collected
his
men
and
with
shouts
and
quarrels
forced
his
way
among
the
baggage
trains
and
the
prisoners
hemmed
all
sides
emerged
onto
the
kaluga
road
they
marched
very
quickly
without
resting
and
halted
only
when
the
sun
began
set
the
baggage
carts
drew
close
together
and
the
men
began
prepare
for
their
night
rest
they
all
appeared
angry
and
dissatisfied
for
long
time
oaths
angry
shouts
and
fighting
could
heard
from
all
sides
carriage
that
followed
the
escort
ran
into
one
the
carts
and
knocked
hole
with
its
pole
several
soldiers
ran
toward
the
cart
from
different
sides
some
beat
the
carriage
horses
their
heads
turning
them
aside
others
fought
among
themselves
and
pierre
saw
that
one
german
was
badly
wounded
the
head
sword
seemed
that
all
these
men
now
that
they
had
stopped
amid
fields
the
chill
dusk
the
autumn
evening
experienced
one
and
the
same
feeling
unpleasant
awakening
from
the
hurry
and
eagerness
push
that
had
seized
them
the
start
once
standstill
they
all
seemed
understand
that
they
did
not
yet
know
where
they
were
going
and
that
much
that
was
painful
and
difficult
awaited
them
this
journey
during
this
halt
the
escort
treated
the
prisoners
even
worse
than
they
had
done
the
start
was
here
that
the
prisoners
for
the
first
time
received
horseflesh
for
their
meat
ration
from
the
officer
down
the
lowest
soldier
they
showed
what
seemed
like
personal
spite
against
each
the
prisoners
unexpected
contrast
their
former
friendly
relations
this
spite
increased
still
more
when
calling
over
the
roll
prisoners
was
found
that
the
bustle
leaving
moscow
one
russian
soldier
who
had
pretended
suffer
from
colic
had
escaped
pierre
saw
frenchman
beat
russian
soldier
cruelly
for
straying
too
far
from
the
road
and
heard
his
friend
the
captain
reprimand
and
threaten
court
martial
noncommissioned
officer
account
the
escape
the
russian
the
noncommissioned
officer
excuse
that
the
prisoner
was
ill
and
could
not
walk
the
officer
replied
that
the
order
was
shoot
those
who
lagged
behind
pierre
felt
that
that
fatal
force
which
had
crushed
him
during
the
executions
but
which
had
not
felt
during
his
imprisonment
now
again
controlled
his
existence
was
terrible
but
felt
that
proportion
the
efforts
that
fatal
force
crush
him
there
grew
and
strengthened
his
soul
power
life
independent
ate
his
supper
buckwheat
soup
with
horseflesh
and
chatted
with
his
comrades
neither
pierre
nor
any
the
others
spoke
what
they
had
seen
moscow
the
roughness
their
treatment
the
french
the
order

them
which
had
been
announced
them
reaction
against
the
worsening
their
position
they
were
all
particularly
animated
and
gay
they
spoke
personal
reminiscences
amusing
scenes
they
had
witnessed
during
the
campaign
and
avoided
all
talk
their
present
situation
the
sun
had
set
long
since
bright
stars
shone
out
here
and
there
the
sky
red
glow
conflagration
spread
above
the
horizon
from
the
rising
full
moon
and
that
vast
red
ball
swayed
strangely
the
gray
haze
grew
light
the
evening
was
ending
but
the
night
had
not
yet
come
pierre
got
and
left
his
new
companions
crossing
between
the
campfires
the
other
side
the
road
where
had
been
told
the
common
soldier
prisoners
were
stationed
wanted
talk
them
the
road
was
stopped
french
sentinel
who
ordered
him
back
pierre
turned
back
not
his
companions
the
campfire
but
unharnessed
cart
where
there
was
nobody
tucking
his
legs
under
him
and
dropping
his
head
sat
down
the
cold
ground
the
wheel
the
cart
and
remained
motionless
long
while
sunk
thought
suddenly
burst
out
into
fit
his
broad
good
natured
laughter
loud
that
men
from
various
sides
turned
with
surprise
see
what
this
strange
and
evidently
solitary
laughter
could
mean
laughed
pierre
and
said
aloud
himself
the
soldier
did
not
let
pass
they
took
and
shut
they
hold
captive
what
immortal
soul
and
laughed
till
tears
started
his
eyes
man
got
and
came
see
what
this
queer
big
fellow
was
laughing
all
himself
pierre
stopped
laughing
got
went
farther
away
from
the
inquisitive
man
and
looked
around
him
the
huge
endless
bivouac
that
had
previously
resounded
with
the
crackling
campfires
and
the
voices
many
men
had
grown
quiet
the
red
campfires
were
growing
paler
and
dying
down
high
the
light
sky
hung
the
full
moon
forests
and
fields
beyond
the
camp
unseen
before
were
now
visible
the
distance
and
farther
still
beyond
those
forests
and
fields
the
bright
oscillating
limitless
distance
lured
one
itself
pierre
glanced
the
sky
and
the
twinkling
stars
its
faraway
depths
and
all
that
all
that
within
and
all
thought
pierre
and
they
caught
all
that
and
put
into
shed
boarded
with
planks
smiled
and
went
and
lay
down
sleep
beside
his
companions
chapter
the
early
days
october
another
envoy
came
kutuzov
with
letter
from
napoleon
proposing
peace
and
falsely
dated
from
moscow
though
napoleon
was
already
not
far
from
kutuzov
the
old
kaluga
road
kutuzov
replied
this
letter
had
done
the
one
formerly
brought
lauriston
saying
that
there
could
question
peace
soon
after
that
report
was
received
from
dorokhov
guerrilla
detachment
operating
the
left
tarutino
that
troops
broussier
division
had
been
seen
forminsk
and
that
being
separated
from
the
rest
the
french
army
they
might
easily
destroyed
the
soldiers
and
officers
again
demanded
action
generals
the
staff
excited
the
memory
the
easy
victory
tarutino
urged
kutuzov
carry
out
dorokhov
suggestion
kutuzov
did
not
consider
any
offensive
necessary
the
result
was
compromise
which
was
inevitable
small
detachment
was
sent
forminsk
attack
broussier
strange
coincidence
this
task
which
turned
out
most
difficult
and
important
one
was
entrusted
dokhturov
that
same
modest
little
dokhturov
whom
one
had
described
drawing
plans
battles
dashing
about
front
regiments
showering
crosses
batteries
and
and
who
was
thought
and
was
spoken
undecided
and
undiscerning
but
whom
find
commanding
wherever
the
position
was
most
difficult
all
through
the
russo
french
wars
from
austerlitz
the
year
austerlitz
remained
last
the
augezd
dam
rallying
the
regiments
saving
what
was
possible
when
all
were
flying
and
perishing
and
not
single
general
was
left
the
rear
guard
ill
with
fever
went
smolensk
with
twenty
thousand
men
defend
the
town
against
napoleon
whole
army
smolensk
the
malakhov
gate
had
hardly
dozed
off
paroxysm
fever
before
was
awakened
the
bombardment
the
town
and
smolensk
held
out
all
day
long
the
battle
borodino
when
bagration
was
killed
and
nine
tenths
the
men
our
left
flank
had
fallen
and
the
full
force
the
french
artillery
fire
was
directed
against
the
man
sent
there
was
this
same
irresolute
and
undiscerning
dokhturov
kutuzov
hastening
rectify
mistake
had
made
sending
someone
else
there
first
and
the
quiet
little
dokhturov
rode
thither
and
borodino
became
the
greatest
glory
the
russian
army
many
heroes
have
been
described
verse
and
prose
but
dokhturov
scarcely
word
has
been
said
was
dokhturov
again
whom
they
sent
forminsk
and
from
there
malo
yaroslavets
the
place
where
the
last
battle
with
the
french
was
fought
and
where
the
obvious
disintegration
the
french
army
began
and
are
told
many
geniuses
and
heroes
that
period
the
campaign
but
dokhturov
nothing
very
little
said
and
that
dubiously
and
this
silence
about
dokhturov
the
clearest
testimony
his
merit
natural
for
man
who
does
not
understand
the
workings
machine
imagine
that
shaving
that
has
fallen
into
chance
and
interfering
with
its
action
and
tossing
about
its
most
important
part
the
man
who
does
not
understand
the
construction
the
machine
cannot
conceive
that
the
small
connecting
cogwheel
which
revolves
quietly
one
the
most
essential
parts
the
machine
and
not
the
shaving
which
merely
harms
and
hinders
the
working
the
tenth
october
when
dokhturov
had
gone
halfway
forminsk
and
stopped
the
village
aristovo
preparing
faithfully
execute
the
orders
had
received
the
whole
french
army
having
its
convulsive
movement
reached
murat
position
apparently
order
give
battle
suddenly
without
any
reason
turned
off
the
left
onto
the
new
kaluga
road
and
began
enter
forminsk
where
only
broussier
had
been
till
then
that
time
dokhturov
had
under
his
command
besides
dorokhov
detachment
the
two
small
guerrilla
detachments
figner
and
seslavin
the
evening
october
seslavin
came
the

headquarters
with
french

captured
the

said
that
the
troops
that
had
entered
forminsk
that
day
were
the
vanguard
the
whole
army
that
napoleon
was
there
and
the
whole
army
had
left
moscow
four
days
previously
that
same
evening
house
serf
who
had
come
from
borovsk
said
had
seen
immense
army
entering
the
town
some
cossacks
dokhturov
detachment
reported
having
sighted
the
french
guards
marching
along
the
road
borovsk
from
all
these
reports
was
evident
that
where
they
had
expected
meet
single
division
there
was
now
the
whole
french
army
marching
from
moscow
unexpected
direction
along
the
kaluga
road
dokhturov
was
unwilling
undertake
any
action
was
not
clear
him
now
what
ought
had
been
ordered
attack
forminsk
but
only
broussier
had
been
there
that
time
and
now
the
whole
french
army
was
there
ermolov
wished
act
his
own
judgment
but
dokhturov
insisted
that
must
have
kutuzov
instructions
was
decided
send
dispatch
the
staff
for
this
purpose
capable
officer
bolkhovitinov
was
chosen
who
was

besides
delivering

report
toward
midnight
bolkhovitinov
having
received
the

galloped
off

the

you

wake
the

first
but
this
very
important
from

dokhturov
said
bolkhovitinov
entering
the
open

which
had
found
feeling

gone
before
him
and
began

bolkhovitinov
unable

the

the

who
was
still
asleep
this
was
konovnitsyn
when
the

the
sulphur

kindled
the

burned
first

and
then

shcherbinin
lit
the

from

the

running
away

the

bolkhovitinov

bespattered
all
over
with

had
smeared

with
his

shcherbinin

konovnitsyn

not

the

said
with
smile
knowing
that
those
words
would
sure
arouse
him
and
fact
the
head
the
nightcap
was
lifted
once
konovnitsyn
handsome
resolute
face
with
cheeks
flushed
fever
there
still
remained
for
instant
faraway
dreamy
expression
remote
from
present
affairs
but
then
suddenly
started
and
his
face
assumed
its
habitual
calm
and
firm
appearance
well
what
from
whom
asked
immediately
but
without
hurry
blinking
the
light
while
listening
the
officer
report
konovnitsyn
broke
the
seal
and
read
the
dispatch
hardly
had
done
before
lowered
his
legs
their
woolen
stockings
the
earthen
floor
and
began
putting
his
boots
then
took
off
his
nightcap
combed
his
hair
over
his
temples
and
donned
his
cap
did
you
get
here
quickly
let
his
highness
konovnitsyn
had
understood
once
that
the
news
brought
was
great
importance
and
that
time
must
lost
did
not
consider
ask
himself
whether
the
news
was
good
bad
that
did
not
interest
him
regarded
the
whole
business
the
war
not
with
his
intelligence
his
reason
but
something
else
there
was
within
him
deep
unexpressed
conviction
that
all
would
well
but
that
one
must
not
trust
this
and
still
less
speak
about
but
must
only
attend
one
own
work
and
did
his
work
giving
his
whole
strength
the
task
peter
petrovich
konovnitsyn
like
dokhturov
seems
have
been
included
merely
for
propriety
sake
the
list
the
called
heroes
the
barclays
raevskis
ermolovs
platovs
and
miloradoviches
like
dokhturov
had
the
reputation
being
man
very
limited
capacity
and
information
and
like
dokhturov
never
made
plans
battle
but
was
always
found
where
the
situation
was
most
difficult
since
his
appointment
general
duty
had
always
slept
with
his
door
open
giving
orders
that
every
messenger
should
allowed
wake
him
battle
was
always
under
fire
that
kutuzov
reproved
him
for
and
feared
send
him
the
front
and
like
dokhturov
was
one
those
unnoticed
cogwheels
that
without
clatter
noise
constitute
the
most
essential
part
the
machine
coming
out
the
hut
into
the
damp
dark
night
konovnitsyn
frowned
partly
from
increased
pain
his
head
and
partly
the
unpleasant
thought
that
occurred
him
how
all
that
nest
influential
men
the
staff
would
stirred
this
news
especially
bennigsen
who
ever
since
tarutino
had
been
daggers
drawn
with
kutuzov
and
how
they
would
make
suggestions
quarrel
issue
orders
and
rescind
them
and
this
premonition
was
disagreeable
him
though
knew
could
not
helped
and
fact
toll
whom
went
communicate
the
news
immediately
began
expound
his
plans
general
sharing
his
quarters
until
konovnitsyn
who
listened
weary
silence
reminded
him
that
they
must
see
his
highness
chapter
xvii
kutuzov
like
all
old
people
did
not
sleep
much
night
often
fell
asleep
unexpectedly
the
daytime
but
night
lying
his
bed
without
undressing
generally
remained
awake
thinking
lay
now
his
bed
supporting
his
large
heavy
scarred
head
his
plump
hand
with
his
one
eye
open
meditating
and
peering
into
the
darkness
since
bennigsen
who
corresponded
with
the
emperor
and
had
more
influence
than
anyone
else
the
staff
had
begun
avoid
him
kutuzov
was
more
ease
the
possibility
himself
and
his
troops
being
obliged
take
part
useless
aggressive
movements
the
lesson
the
tarutino
battle
and
the
day
before
which
kutuzov
remembered
with
pain
must
thought
have
some
effect
others
too
they
must
understand
that
can
only
lose
taking
the
offensive
patience
and
time
are
warriors
champions
thought
kutuzov
knew
that
apple
should
not
plucked
while
green
will
fall
itself
when
ripe
but
picked
unripe
the
apple
spoiled
the
tree
harmed
and
your
teeth
are
set
edge
like
experienced
sportsman
knew
that
the
beast
was
wounded
and
wounded
only
the
whole
strength
russia
could
have
wounded
but
whether
was
mortally
wounded
not
was
still
undecided
question
now
the
fact
lauriston
and
barthelemi
having
been
sent
and
the
reports
the
guerrillas
kutuzov
was
almost
sure
that
the
wound
was
mortal
but
needed
further
proofs
and
was
necessary
wait
they
want
run
see
how
they
have
wounded
wait
and
shall
see
continual
maneuvers
continual
advances
thought
what
for
only
distinguish
themselves
fighting
were
fun
they
are
like
children
from
whom
one
can
get
any
sensible
account
what
has
happened
because
they
all
want
show
how
well
they
can
fight
but
that
not
what
needed
now
and
what
ingenious
maneuvers
they
all
propose
seems
them
that
when
they
have
thought
two
three
contingencies
remembered
the
general
plan
sent
him
from
petersburg
they
have
foreseen
everything
but
the
contingencies
are
endless
the
undecided
question
whether
the
wound
inflicted
borodino
was
mortal
not
had
hung
over
kutuzov
head
for
whole
month
the
one
hand
the
french
had
occupied
moscow
the
other
kutuzov
felt
assured
with
all
his
being
that
the
terrible
blow
into
which
and
all
the
russians
had
put
their
whole
strength
must
have
been
mortal
but
any
case
proofs
were
needed
had
waited
whole
month
for
them
and
grew
more
impatient
the
longer
waited
lying
his
bed
during
those
sleepless
nights
did
just
what
reproached
those
younger
generals
for
doing
imagined
all
sorts
possible
contingencies
just
like
the
younger
men
but
with
this
difference
that
saw
thousands
contingencies
instead
two
three
and
based
nothing
them
the
longer
thought
the
more
contingencies
presented
themselves
imagined
all
sorts
movements
the
napoleonic
army
whole
sections
against
petersburg
against
him
outflank
him
thought
too
the
possibility
which
feared
most
all
that
napoleon
might
fight
him
with
his
own
weapon
and
remain
moscow
awaiting
him
kutuzov
even
imagined
that
napoleon
army
might
turn
back
through
medyn
and
yukhnov
but
the
one
thing
could
not
foresee
was
what
happened
the
insane
convulsive
stampede
napoleon
army
during
its
first
eleven
days
after
leaving
moscow
stampede
which
made
possible
what
kutuzov
had
not
yet
even
dared
think
the
complete
extermination
the
french
dorokhov
report
about
broussier
division
the
guerrillas
reports
distress
napoleon
army
rumors
preparations
for
leaving
moscow
all
confirmed
the
supposition
that
the
french
army
was
beaten
and
preparing
for
flight
but
these
were
only
suppositions
which
seemed
important
the
younger
men
but
not
kutuzov
with
his
sixty
years
experience
knew
what
value
attach
rumors
knew
how
apt
people
who
desire
anything
are
group
all
news
that
appears
confirm
what
they
desire
and
knew
how
readily
such
cases
they
omit
all
that
makes
for
the
contrary
and
the
more
desired
the
less
allowed
himself
believe
this
question
absorbed
all
his
mental
powers
all
else
was
him
only
life
customary
routine
such
customary
routine
belonged
his
conversations
with
the
staff
the
letters
wrote
from
tarutino
madame
stael
the
reading
novels
the
distribution
awards
his
correspondence
with
petersburg
and
but
the
destruction
the
french
which
alone
foresaw
was
his
heart
one
desire
the
night
the
eleventh
october
lay
leaning
his
arm
and
thinking
that
there
was
stir
the
next
room
and
heard
the
steps
toll
konovnitsyn
and
bolkhovitinov
who
there
come
come
what
news
the
field
marshal
called
out
them
while
footman
was
lighting
candle
toll
communicated
the
substance
the
news
who
brought
asked
kutuzov
with
look
which
when
the
candle
was

what

not

the
fact
that
nothing
prevented
him
from
advancing
into

for
the

did
not
bar

the

that
nothing
could
have
saved
his

for
then
already
bore
within

the

inevitable
ruin
how
could
that
army
which
had
found
abundant
supplies
moscow
and
had
trampled
them
underfoot
instead
keeping
them
and
arriving
smolensk
had

instead

how
could

the

came
about

pretending

all

were

the
opinion
uttered
the
simple
minded
soldier
mouton
who
speaking
last
said
what
they
all
felt
that
the
one
thing
needful
was
get
away
quickly
possible
and
one
not
even
napoleon
could
say
anything
against
that
truth
which
they
all
recognized
but
though
they
all
realized
that
was
necessary
get
away
there
still
remained
feeling
shame
admitting
that
they
must
flee
external
shock
was
needed
overcome
that
shame
and
this
shock
came
due
time
was
what
the
french
called

the
day
after
the
council
malo

napoleon
rode
out

for

fell
with
the
emperor
and
very
nearly
captured
him
the
cossacks
did
not
capture
napoleon
then
what
saved
him
was
the
very
thing
that
was
destroying
the
french
army
the
booty
which
the
cossacks
fell
here
tarutino
they
went
after
plunder
leaving
the
men
disregarding
napoleon
they
rushed
after
the
plunder
and
napoleon
managed
escape
when
les

don
might
easily
have
taken
the
emperor
himself
the
midst
his
army
was
clear
that
there
was
nothing
for
but
fly
fast
possible
along
the
nearest
familiar
road
napoleon
with
his
forty
year
old
stomach
understood
that
hint
not
feeling
his
former
agility
and
boldness
and
under
the
influence
the
fright
the
cossacks
had
given
him
once
agreed
with
mouton
and
issued
orders
the
historians
tell
retreat
the
smolensk
road
that
napoleon
agreed
with
mouton
and
that
the
army
retreated
does
not
prove
that

caused

toward

all

not
that

their

china

which
the

usual

when

the

concerned
some
brief
conflict
which
only

treat

this

occurred
before

for

and
happened
the
greatest
all
known

the
period
the
campaign
from
the

the

the
french
proved
that
the

proved
that
the

not

but
something
else
the
french
historians
describing
the
condition
the

before

affirm
that
all
was
order
the

except
the

the

there
was

for

the

than

gained

because
the
peasants
karp
and

who
after
the
french
had
evacuated
moscow
drove
their
carts
pillage
the
town
and
general
personally
failed

any
heroic
feelings
and
the
whole
innumerable
multitude
such
peasants
did
not
bring
their
hay
moscow
for
the
high
price
offered
them
but
burned
instead
let
imagine
two
men
who
have
come
out
fight
duel
with
rapiers
according
all
the
rules
the
art
fencing
the
fencing
has
gone
for
some
time
suddenly
one
the
combatants
feeling
himself
wounded
and
understanding
that
the
matter
joke
but
concerns
his
life
throws
down
his
rapier
and
seizing
the
first
cudgel
that
comes

begins
brandish
then
let
imagine
that
the
combatant
who
sensibly
employed
the
best
and
simplest
means
attain
his
end
was
the
same
time
influenced
traditions
chivalry
and
desiring
conceal
the
facts
the
case
insisted
that
had
gained
his
victory
with
the
rapier
according
all
the
rules

one
can
imagine
what
confusion

obscurity
would
result
from
such

the

the

his

those
who
try

the

the
russians
people
have
called
this

warfare
and
assume
that

they
have

its

such

does
not
fit

directly
opposed

the

history

this

arises
from
the
fact
that

chapter
iii
the
called
partisan

began
with
the
entry
the

davydov
with
his
russian
instinct
was
the
first
recognize
the
value
this
terrible
cudgel
which
regardless
the
rules
military
science
destroyed
the
french
and
him
belongs
the
credit
for
taking
the
first
step
toward
regularizing
this
method
warfare
august
davydov
first
partisan
detachment
was
formed
and
then
others
were
recognized
the
further
the
campaign
progressed
the
more
numerous
these
detachments
became
the
irregulars
destroyed
the
great
army
piecemeal
they
gathered
the
fallen
leaves
that
dropped
themselves
from
that
withered
tree
the
french
army
and
sometimes
shook
that
tree
itself
october
when
the
french
were
fleeing
toward
smolensk
there
were
hundreds
such
companies
various
sizes
and
characters
there
were
some
that
adopted
all
the
army
methods
and
had
infantry

consisted
solely

captured
several

the

month
and
there
was
vasilisa

who
slew
hundreds
the
french
the
partisan
warfare
flamed
most
fiercely
the
latter
days
october
its
first
period
had
passed
when
the
partisans
themselves
amazed
their
own
boldness
feared
every
minute
surrounded
and
captured
the
french
and
hid
the
forests
without
unsaddling
hardly
daring
dismount
and
always
expecting
pursued
the
end
october
this
kind
warfare
had
taken
definite
shape
had
become
clear
all
what
could
ventured
against
the
french
and
what
could
not
now
only
the
commanders
detachments
with
staffs
and
moving
according
rules
distance
from
the
french
still
regarded
many
things
impossible
the
small
bands
that
had
started
their
activities
long
before
and
had
already
observed
the
french
closely
considered
things
possible
which
the
commanders
the
big
detachments
did
not
dare
contemplate
the
cossacks
and
peasants
who
crept
among
the
french
now
considered
everything
possible
october
denisov
who
was
one
the
irregulars
was
with
his
group

enthusiasm
since
early
morning
and
his

had
been
the

the

some
large

also
knew

denisov
expressed
were
sharpening
their
teeth
for
two
the

large
parties
one
pole
and
the

sent
invitations
denisov
almost
simultaneously
requesting
him
join
with
their
divisions
attack
the

bwother
have
gwown
mustaches
myself
said
denisov
reading
these
documents
and
wrote
the
german
that
despite
his
heartfelt
desire
serve
under
valiant
and
renowned
general
had
forgo
that
pleasure
because
was
already
under

the

informing
him
that
was

lifted
the
boy
down
and
took
him
denisov
pointing
the
french
troops
denisov
asked
him
what
these
and
those
them
were
the
boy
thrusting
his
cold
hands
into
his
pockets
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
looked
denisov
affright
but
spite
evident
desire
say
all
knew
gave
confused
answers
merely
assenting
everything
denisov
asked
him
denisov
turned
away
from
him
frowning
and
addressed
the
esaul
conveying
his
own
conjectures
him
petya
rapidly
turning
his
head
looked
now
the
drummer
boy
now
denisov
now
the
esaul
and
now
the
french
the
village
and
along
the
road
trying
not
miss
anything
importance
whether
dolokhov
comes

must
seize
said
denisov
with
merry
sparkle
his
eyes
very
suitable
spot
said
the

send
the

down
the
swamps
denisov
continued
they
cweep

you
wide
fwom
there
with
the

the
forest
beyond
the
village
and
with

and
the
signal
shot
the
hollow
impassable
there
swamp
there
said
the
esaul
the
horses
would
sink
must
ride
round
more
the
left
while
they
were
talking
undertones
the
crack
shot
sounded
from
the
low
ground
the
pond
puff
white
smoke
appeared
then
another
and
the
sound
hundreds
seemingly
merry
french
voices
shouting
together
came
from
the
slope
for
moment
denisov
and
the
esaul
drew
back
they
were
near
that
they
thought
they
were
the
cause
the
firing
and
shouting
but
the
firing
and
shouting
did
not
relate
them
down
below
man
wearing
something
red
was
running
through
the
marsh
the
french
were
evidently
firing
and
shouting
him
why
that
our
tikhon
said
the
esaul
the
wascal
said
denisov
get
away
said
the
esaul
screwing
his
eyes
the
man
whom
they
called
tikhon
having
run
the
stream
plunged
that
the
water
splashed
the
air
and
having
disappeared
for
instant
scrambled
out
all
fours
all
black
with
the
wet
and
ran
the
french
who
had
been
pursuing
him
stopped
smart
that
said
the
esaul
what
beast
said
denisov
with
his
former
look
vexation
what
has
been
doing
all
this
time
who
asked
petya
our
plastun
sent
him
capture
tongue
yes
said
petya
nodding
the
first
words
denisov
uttered
understood
all
though
really
did
not
understand
anything
tikhon
shcherbaty
was
one
the
most
indispensable
men
their
band
was
peasant
from
pokrovsk
near
the
river
gzhat
when
denisov
had
come
pokrovsk
the
beginning
his
operations
and
had
usual
summoned
the
village
elder
and
asked
him
what
knew
about
the
french
the
elder
though
shielding
himself
had
replied
all
village
elders
did
that
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
them
but
when
denisov
explained
that
his
purpose
was
kill
the
french
and
asked
french
had
strayed
that
way
the
elder
replied
that
some
more
orderers
had
really
been
their
village
but
that
tikhon
shcherbaty
was
the
only
man
who
dealt
with
such
matters
denisov
had
tikhon
called
and
having
praised
him
for
his
activity
said
few
words
the
elder
presence
about
loyalty
the
tsar
and
the
country
and
the
hatred
the
french
that
all
sons
the
fatherland
should
cherish
don
the
french
any
harm
said
tikhon
evidently
frightened
denisov
words
only
fooled
about
with
the
lads
for
fun
you
know
killed
score
more
orderers
but
did
harm
else
next
day
when
denisov
had
left
pokrovsk
having
quite
forgotten
about
this
peasant
was
reported
him
that
tikhon
had
attached
himself
their
party
and
asked
allowed
remain
with
denisov
gave
orders
let
him
tikhon
who
first
did
rough
work
laying
campfires
fetching
water
flaying
dead
horses
and
soon
showed
great
liking
and
aptitude
for
partisan
warfare
night
would
out
for
booty
and
always
brought
back
french
clothing
and
weapons
and
when
told
would
bring
french
captives
also
denisov
then
relieved
him
from
drudgery
and
began
taking
him
with
him
when
went
out
expeditions
and
had
him
enrolled
among
the
cossacks
tikhon
did
not
like
riding
and
always
went
foot
never
lagging
behind
the
cavalry
was
armed
with
musketoon
which
carried
rather
joke
pike
and
which
latter
used
wolf
uses
its
teeth
with
equal
ease
picking
fleas
out
its
fur
crunching
thick
bones
tikhon
with
equal
accuracy
would
split
logs
with
blows
arm
length
holding
the
head
the
would
cut
thin
little
pegs
carve
spoons
denisov
party
held
peculiar
and
exceptional
position
when
anything
particularly
difficult
nasty
had
done
push
cart
out
the
mud
with
one
shoulders
pull
horse
out
swamp
its
tail
skin
slink
among
the
french
walk
more
than
thirty
miles
day
everybody
pointed
laughingly
tikhon
won
hurt
that
devil
strong
horse
they
said
him
once
frenchman
tikhon
was
trying
capture
fired
pistol
him
and
shot
him
the
fleshy
part
the
back
that
wound
which
tikhon
treated
only
with
internal
and
external
applications
vodka
was
the
subject
the
liveliest
jokes
the
whole
detachment
jokes
which
tikhon
readily
joined
hallo
mate
never
again
gave
you
twist
the
cossacks
would
banter
him
and
tikhon
purposely
writhing
and
making
faces
pretended
angry
and
swore
the
french
with
the
funniest
curses
the
only
effect
this
incident
tikhon
was
that
after
being
wounded
seldom
brought
prisoners
was
the
bravest
and
most
useful
man
the
party
one
found
more
opportunities
for
attacking
one
captured
killed
more
frenchmen
and
consequently
was
made
the
buffoon
all
the
cossacks
and
hussars
and
willingly
accepted
that
role
now
had
been
sent
denisov
overnight
shamshevo
capture

but
whether
because
had
not
been
content
take
only
one
frenchman
because
had
slept
through
the
night

crept
day
into
some
bushes
right
among
the
french
and
denisov
had
witnessed

chapter
after
talking
for
some
time
with
the
esaul
about

definitely
decided

petya
they
approached

threw
something
into
the
bushes

sodden
hat
its
floppy
brim
and
approached
his
commander

wrinkled
and
pockmarked
face
and
narrow
little
eyes
beamed
with
self
satisfied
merriment
lifted
his
head
high
and
gazed
denisov
repressing
laugh
well
where

inquired
denisov

puddles
said
the
esaul
screwing
his
glittering
eyes
petya
badly
wanted
laugh
but
noticed
that
they
all
refrained
from
laughing
turned
his
eyes
rapidly
from
tikhon
face
the
esaul
and
denisov
unable
make
out
what
all
meant

said
denisov
coughing
angrily
why

you
bwing
the
first
one
tikhon
scratched
his
back
with
one
hand
and
his
head
with
the
other
then
suddenly
his
whole
face
expanded
into
beaming
foolish
grin
disclosing
gap
where
had
lost
tooth
that
was
why
was
called
shcherbaty
the
gap
toothed
denisov
smiled
and
petya
burst
into
peal
merry
laughter
which
tikhon
himself
joined
but
was
regular

for
nothing

tikhon

cheerfully
and
resolutely
into
denisov
eyes
give
you
hundwed
sharp
lashes
that

fool
said
denisov
severely
but

said
denisov
and
rode
all
the
way
the
watchhouse
silence
and
frowning
angrily
tikhon
followed
behind
and
petya
heard
the
cossacks
laughing
with
him
and
him
about
some
pair
boots
had
thrown
into
the
bushes
when
the
fit
laughter
that
had
seized
him
tikhon
words
and
smile
had
passed
and
petya
realized
for
moment
that
this
tikhon
had
killed
man
felt
uneasy
looked
round
the
captive
drummer
boy
and
felt
pang
his
heart
but
this
uneasiness
lasted
only
moment
felt
necessary
hold
his
head
higher
brace
himself
and
question
the
esaul
with
air
importance
about
tomorrow
undertaking
that
might
not
unworthy
the
company
which
found
himself
the
officer
who
had
been
sent
inquire
met
denisov
the
way
with
the
news
that
dolokhov
was
soon
coming
and
that
all
was
well
with
him
denisov
once
cheered
and
calling
petya
him
said
well
tell
about
yourself
chapter
vii
petya
having
left
his
people
after
their
departure
from
moscow
joined
his
regiment
and
was
soon
taken
orderly
general
commanding
large
guerrilla
detachment
from
the
time
received
his
commission
and
especially
since
had
joined
the
active
army
and
taken
part
the
battle
vyazma
petya
had
been
constant
state
blissful
excitement
being
grown
and
perpetual
ecstatic
hurry
not
miss
any
chance
something
really
heroic
was
highly
delighted
with
what
saw
and
experienced
the
army
but
the
same
time
always
seemed
him
that
the
really
heroic
exploits
were
being
performed
just
where
did
not
happen
and
was
always
hurry
get
where
was
not
when
the
twenty
first
october
his
general
expressed
wish
send
somebody
denisov
detachment
petya
begged
piteously
sent
that
the
general
could
not
refuse
but
when
dispatching
him
recalled
petya
mad
action
the
battle
vyazma
where
instead
riding
the
road
the
place
which
had
been
sent
had
galloped
the
advanced
line
under
the
fire
the
french
and
had
there
twice
fired
his
pistol
now
the
general
explicitly
forbade
his
taking
part
any
action
whatever
denisov
that
was
why
petya
had
blushed
and
grown
confused
when
denisov
asked
him
whether
could
stay
before
they
had
ridden
the
outskirts
the
forest
petya
had
considered
must
carry
out
his
instructions
strictly
and
return
once
but
when
saw
the
french
and
saw
tikhon
and
learned
that
there
would
certainly
attack
that
night
decided
with
the
rapidity
with
which
young
people
change
their
views
that
the
general
whom
had
greatly
respected
till
then
was
rubbishy
german
that
denisov
was
hero
the
esaul
hero
and
tikhon
hero
too
and
that
would
shameful
for
him
leave
them
moment
difficulty
was
already
growing
dusk
when
denisov
petya
and
the
esaul
rode
the
watchhouse
the
twilight
saddled
horses
could
seen
and
cossacks
and
hussars
who
had
rigged
rough
shelters
the
glade
and
were
kindling
glowing
fires
hollow
the
forest
where
the
french
could
not
see
the
smoke
the
passage
the
small
watchhouse
cossack
with
sleeves
rolled
was
chopping
some
mutton
the
room
three
officers
denisov
band
were
converting
door
into
tabletop
petya
took
off
his
wet
clothes
gave
them
dried
and
once
began
helping
the
officers
fix
the
dinner
table
ten
minutes
the
table
was
ready
and
napkin
spread
the
table
were
vodka
flask
rum
white
bread
roast
mutton
and
salt
sitting
table
with
the
officers
and
tearing
the
fat
savory
mutton
with
his
hands
down
which
the
grease
trickled
petya
was
ecstatic
childish
state
love
for
all
men
and
consequently
confidence
that
others
loved
him
the
same
way
then
what
you
think
vasili
dmitrich
said
denisov
all
right
staying
day
with
you
and
not
waiting
for
reply
answered
his
own
question
you
see
was
told
find
out
well
finding
out
only
let
into
the
very
into
the
chief
don
want
reward
but
want
petya
clenched
his
teeth
and
looked
around
throwing
back
his
head
and
flourishing
his
arms
into
the
vewy
chief
denisov
repeated
with
smile
only
please
let
command
something
that
may
really
command
petya
went
what
would
you
you
want
knife
said
turning
officer
who
wished
cut
himself
piece
mutton
and
handed
him
his
clasp
knife
the
officer
admired

several

said
petya
blushing
heavens
was
quite
forgetting
suddenly
cried

sutler
and

such
capital
things
bought
ten
pounds
used
something

and
petya
ran
out
into
the
passage
his
cossack
and
brought
back
some
bags
which
contained
about
five
pounds
raisins
have
some
gentlemen
have
some
you

asked
the
esaul

very
honest
that

very
cheap
please
take

want
all

then
suddenly
dismayed
lest
had
said
too
much
petya
stopped
and
blushed
tried
remember
whether
had
not
done
anything
else
that
was
foolish
and
running
over
the
events
the
day
remembered
the
french
drummer
boy
capital
for
here
but
what
him
where
have
they
put
him
have
they
fed
him
haven
they
hurt
his
feelings
thought
but
having
caught
himself
saying
too
much
about
the
flints
was
now
afraid
speak
out
might
ask
thought
but
they
say
boy
himself
and
pities
the
boy
show
them
tomorrow
whether
boy
will
seem
odd
ask
petya
thought
well
never
mind
and
immediately
blushing
and
looking
anxiously
the
officers
see
they
appeared
ironical
said
may
call
that
boy
who
was
taken
prisoner
and
give
him
something
eat
perhaps
yes
poor
little
fellow
said
denisov
who

repeated
petya

standing

door
when
denisov
said

slipped
between
the
officers
came
close
denisov
and
said
let
kiss

old
fellow
how
fine
how
splendid
and
having
kissed
denisov
ran
out
the
hut
bosse
vincent
petya
cried
stopping
outside
the
door
who

asked
voice
the
darkness
petya
replied
that

french

said
cossack
vincent
the
boy

had
already
been
changed
the
cossacks
into

vernal
and
into

the
peasants
and

both
these
adaptations
the

matched
the
impression
made
the
young

warming

while
ago

awfully

the

bare

splashing
through
the
mud
was
heard
the
darkness
and
the
drummer

and
his

dolokhov

large
detachments

irony
but

petya
shyly
but

dolokhov
found
particular
pleasure
speaking

subject
which
irritated
denisov

swaying
his
head
because

say

die
all

dolokhov
began
laughing
who
has
told
them
not

these
twenty
times
over
but
they
did
catch
they
string
aspen
tree
and
with

cried
petya
blushing
almost
tears
and
glancing
denisov
while
dolokhov
had
been
disputing
with
denisov
what
should
done
with
prisoners
petya
had
once
more
felt
awkward
and
restless
but
again
had
time
grasp
fully
what
they
were
talking
about
grown
distinguished
men
think
must
necessary
and
right
thought
but
above
all
denisov
must
not
dare
imagine
that
obey
him
and
that
can
order
about
will
certainly
the
french
camp
with
dolokhov
can
can
and
all
denisov
persuasions
petya
replied
that
too
was
accustomed
everything
accurately
and
not
just
anyhow
and
that
never
considered
personal
danger
for
you
admit
that
don
know
for
sure
how
many
them
there
are
hundreds
lives
may
depend
while
there
are
only
two
besides
want
very
much

certainly
will
don
hinder
said

only
make
things
worse
chapter
having
put
french
greatcoats
and
shakos
petya
and
dolokhov
rode
the
clearing
from
which
denisov
had
reconnoitered
the
french
camp
and
emerging
from
the
forest
pitch
darkness
they
descended
into
the
hollow
reaching
the
bottom
dolokhov
told
the
cossacks
accompanying
him
await
him
there
and
rode
quick
trot
along
the
road
the
bridge
petya
his
heart
his
mouth
with
excitement
rode
his
side
caught
won
taken
alive
have
pistol
whispered

said
dolokhov
hurried
whisper
and
that
very
moment
they
heard
through
the
darkness
the
challenge
qui

and
the
click
musket
who
goes
there
the
blood
rushed
petya

and
grasped

dolokhov
neither

and
advanced

asked
tell

repeated
the
sentinel
barring
the
way
and
not
replying
quand

les

mot

cried
dolokhov
suddenly
flaring
and
riding
straight
the
sentinel
vous

when
officer
making
his
round
sentinels
don
ask
him
for
the
password
asking
you
the
colonel
here
and
without
waiting
for
answer
from
the
sentinel
who
had
stepped
aside
dolokhov
rode
the
incline
walk
noticing
the
black
outline
man
crossing
the
road
dolokhov
stopped
him
and
inquired
where
the
commander
and
officers
were
the
man
soldier
with
sack
over
his
shoulder
stopped
came
close
dolokhov
horse
touched
with
his
hand
and
explained
simply
and
friendly
way
that
the
commander
and
the
officers
were
higher
the
hill
the
right
the
courtyard
the
farm
called
the
landowner
house
having
ridden
the
road
both
sides
which
french
talk
could
heard
around
the
campfires
dolokhov
turned
into
the
courtyard
the
landowner
house
having
ridden
dismounted
and
approached
big
blazing
campfire
around
which
sat
several
men
talking
noisily
something
was
boiling
small
cauldron
the
edge
the
fire
and
soldier
peaked
cap
and
blue
overcoat
lit
the
fire
was
kneeling
beside
stirring
its
contents
with
ramrod
hard
nut
crack
said
one
the
officers
who
was
sitting
the
shadow
the
other
side
the
fire
make
them
get
move
those
fellows
said
another
laughing
both
fell
silent
peering
out
through
the
darkness
the
sound
dolokhov
and
petya
steps
they
advanced
the
fire
leading
their
horses
bonjour
messieurs
said
dolokhov
loudly
and
clearly
good
day
gentlemen
there
was
stir
among
the
officers
the
shadow
beyond
the
fire
and
one
tall
long
necked
officer
walking
round
the
fire
came
dolokhov
that
you
clement
asked
where
the
devil
but
noticing
his
mistake
broke
off
short
and
with
frown
greeted
dolokhov
stranger
asking
what
could
for
him
dolokhov
said
that
and
his
companion
were
trying
overtake
their
regiment
and
addressing
the
company
general
asked
whether
they
knew
anything
the
regiment
none
them
knew
anything
and
petya
thought
the
officers
were
beginning
look
him
and
dolokhov
with
hostility
and
suspicion
for
some
seconds
all
were
silent
you
were
counting
the
evening
soup
you
have
come
too
late
said
voice
from
behind
the
fire
with
repressed
laugh
dolokhov
replied
that
they
were
not
hungry
and
must
push
farther
that
night
handed
the
horses
over
the
soldier
who
was
stirring
the
pot
and
squatted
down
his
heels
the
fire
beside
the
officer
with
the
long
neck
that
officer
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
dolokhov
and
again
asked
what
regiment
belonged
dolokhov
had
not
heard
the
question
did
not
reply
but
lighting
short
french
pipe
which
took
from
his
pocket
began
asking
the
officer
how
far
the
road
before
them
was
safe
from
cossacks
those
brigands
are
everywhere
replied
officer
from
behind
the
fire
dolokhov
remarked
that
the
cossacks
were
danger
only
stragglers
such
his
companion
and
himself
but
probably
they
would
not
dare
attack
large
detachments
added
inquiringly
one
replied
well
now
come
away
petya
thought
every
moment
stood
the
campfire
listening
the
talk
but
dolokhov
restarted
the
conversation
which
had
dropped
and
began
putting
direct
questions
how
many
men
there
were
the
battalion
how
many
battalions
and
how
many
prisoners
asking
about
the
russian
prisoners
with
that
detachment
dolokhov
said
horrid
business
dragging
these
corpses
about
with
one
would
better
shoot
such
rabble
and
burst
into
loud
laughter
strange
that
petya
thought
the
french
would
immediately
detect
their
disguise
and
involuntarily
took
step
back
from
the
campfire
one
replied
word
dolokhov
laughter
and
french
officer
whom
they
could
not
see
lay
wrapped
greatcoat
rose
and
whispered
something
companion
dolokhov
got
and
called
the
soldier
who
was
holding
their
horses
will
they
bring
our
horses
not
thought
petya
instinctively
drawing
nearer
dolokhov
the
horses
were
brought
good
evening
gentlemen
said
dolokhov
petya
wished
say
good
night
but
could
not
utter
word
the
officers
were
whispering
together
dolokhov
was
long
time
mounting
his
horse
which
would
not
stand
still
then
rode
out
the
yard
footpace
petya
rode
beside
him
longing
look
round
see
whether
not
the
french
were
running
after
them
but
not
daring
coming
out
onto
the
road
dolokhov
did
not
ride
back
across
the
open
country
but
through
the
village
one
spot
stopped
and
listened
you
hear
asked
petya
recognized
the
sound
russian
voices
and
saw
the
dark
figures
russian
prisoners
round
their
campfires
when
they
had
descended
the
bridge
petya
and
dolokhov
rode
past
the
sentinel
who
without
saying
word
paced
morosely
and
down
then
they
descended
into
the
hollow
where
the
cossacks
awaited
them
well
now
good
tell
denisov
the
first
shot

said
dolokhov
and
was
about
ride
away
but
petya
seized
hold
him
really
cried

such
hero
how
fine
how
splendid
how
love
you
all
right
all
right
said
dolokhov
but
petya
did
not
let
him
and
dolokhov
saw
through
the
gloom
that
petya
was
bending
toward
him
and
wanted
kiss
him
dolokhov
kissed
him
laughed
turned
his
horse
and
vanished
into
the
darkness

battle
sat
awhile
the
hut
joyfully
recalling
the
details
his
expedition
and
vividly
picturing
himself
what
would
happen
next
day
then
noticing
that
denisov
was
asleep
rose
and
went
out
doors
was
still
quite
dark
outside
the
rain

over
but
drops
were
still
falling
from

black
shapes
the
cossacks

and
horses
tethered
together
could
seen
behind
the
hut
the
dark
shapes
the
two
wagons
with
their
horses
beside
them
were
discernible
and
the
hollow
the
dying
campfire
gleamed
red
not
all
the
cossacks
and
hussars
were
asleep
here
and
there
amid
the
sounds
falling
drops
and
the
munching
the
horses
near
could
heard
low
voices
which
seemed
whispering
petya
came
out
peered
into
the
darkness
and
went
the
wagons
someone
was
snoring
under
them
and
around
them
stood
saddled
horses
munching
their
oats
the
dark
petya
recognized
his
own
horse
which
called

likhachev
got

and
soon
petya
heard
the
warlike
sound
steel
whetstone
climbed
onto
the
wagon
and
sat
its
edge
the
cossack
was
sharpening

time
listening

the
darkness
and
black
figure
appeared
what
are

sharpening
asked
man
coming
the

why
this
gentleman

that
right
said
the
man
whom
petya
took
hussar
was
the
cup
left
here
there
the
wheel
the
hussar
took
the
cup
must
daylight
soon
said
yawning
and
went
away
petya
ought
have
known
that
was
forest
with
denisov
guerrilla
band
less
than
mile
from
the
road
sitting
wagon
captured
from
the
french
beside
which
horses
were
tethered
that
under
likhachev
was
sitting
sharpening
saber
for
him
that
the
big
dark
blotch
the
right
was
the
watchman
hut
and
the
red
blotch
below
the
left
was
the
dying
embers
campfire
that
the
man
who
had
come
for
the
cup
was
hussar
who
wanted
drink
but
neither
knew
nor
waited
know
anything
all
this
was
fairy
kingdom
where
nothing
resembled
reality
the
big
dark
blotch
might
really
the
watchman
hut
might
cavern
leading
the
very
depths
the
earth
perhaps
the
red
spot
was
fire
might
the
eye
enormous
monster
perhaps
was
really
sitting
wagon
but
might
very
well
that
was
not
sitting
wagon
but
terribly
high
tower
from
which
fell
would
have
fall
for
whole
day
whole
month
falling
and
never
reach
the
bottom
perhaps
was
just
the
cossack
likhachev
who
was
sitting
under
the
wagon
but
might
the
kindest
bravest
most
wonderful
most
splendid
man
the
world
whom
one
knew
might
really
have
been
that
the
hussar
came
for
water
and
went
back
into
the
hollow
but
perhaps
had
simply
vanished
disappeared
altogether
and
dissolved
into
nothingness
nothing
petya
could
have
seen
now
would
have
surprised
him
was
fairy
kingdom
where
everything
was
possible
looked
the
sky
and
the
sky
was
fairy
realm
like
the
earth
was
clearing
and
over
the
tops
the
trees
clouds
were
swiftly
sailing
unveiling
the
stars
sometimes
looked
the
clouds
were
passing
and
clear
black
sky
appeared
sometimes
seemed
the
black
spaces
were
clouds
sometimes
the
sky
seemed
rising
high
high
overhead
and
then
seemed
sink
low
that
one
could
touch
with
one
hand
petya
eyes
began
close
and
swayed
little
the
trees
were
dripping
quiet
talking
was
heard
the
horses
neighed
and
jostled
one
another
someone
snored
ozheg
zheg
ozheg
zheg
hissed
the
saber
against
the
whetstone
and
suddenly
petya
heard
harmonious
orchestra
playing
some
unknown
sweetly
solemn
hymn
petya
was
musical
natasha
and
more
than
nicholas
but
had
never
learned
music
thought
about
and
the
melody
that
unexpectedly
came
his
mind
seemed
him
particularly
fresh
and
attractive
the
music
became
more
and
more
audible
the
melody
grew
and
passed
from
one
instrument
another
and
what
was
played
was
fugue
though
petya
had
not
the
least
conception
what
fugue
each
instrument
now
resembling
violin
and
now
horn
but
better
and
clearer
than
violin
horn
played
its
own
part
and
before
had
finished
the
melody
merged
with
another
instrument
that
began
almost
the
same
air
and
then
with
third
and
fourth
and
they
all
blended
into
one
and
again
became
separate
and
again
blended
now
into
solemn
church
music
now
into
something
dazzlingly
brilliant
and
triumphant
why
that
was
dream
petya
said
himself
lurched
forward
ears
but
perhaps
music
own
well
music
now
closed
his
eyes
and
from
all
sides
from
distance
sounds
fluttered
grew
into
harmonies
separated
blended
and
again
all
mingled
into
the
same
sweet
and
solemn
hymn
this
delightful
much
like
and
like
said
petya
himself
tried
conduct
that
enormous
orchestra
now
softly
softly
die
away
and
the
sounds
obeyed
him
now
fuller
more
joyful
still
more
and
more
joyful
and
from
unknown
depth
rose
increasingly
triumphant
sounds
now
voices
join
ordered
petya
and
first
from
afar
heard
men
voices
and
then
women
the
voices
grew
harmonious
triumphant
strength
and
petya
listened
their
surpassing
beauty
awe
and
joy
with
solemn
triumphal
march
there
mingled
song
the
drip
from
the
trees
and
the
hissing
the
saber
ozheg
zheg
zheg
and
again
the
horses
jostled
one
another
and
neighed
not
disturbing
the
choir
but
joining
petya
did
not
know
how
long
this
lasted
enjoyed
himself
all
the
time
wondered
his
enjoyment
and
regretted
that
there
was
one

exclaimed
the
horses
that
had
previously
been
invisible
could
now
seen
their
very
tails
and
watery
light
showed
itself
through
the
bare
branches
petya
shook
himself
jumped
took
ruble
from
his
pocket
and
gave
likhachev
then
flourished
the
saber

and
sheathed
the
cossacks
were
untying
their

tightening
their

here
the

out

having

the

rapidly
picked
out
their

tightened
their

formed

denisov
stood
the

along

impatiently
awaiting

his
face
having
been
bathed

was
all
aglow
and
his

down
his

and
his

pulsed
rhythmically

asked
denisov

the
horses

denisov
was
angry
with
the

because
the

were
too
slack
reproved
him
and
mounted
petya
put
his
foot
the
stirrup
his

made
nip
his

petya
leaped
quickly
into

anywhere
did
not

but
rode
silence
all
the
way
when
they
had
come
the
edge
the
forest
was
noticeably
growing
light
over
the
field
denisov
talked
whispers
with
the
esaul
and
the
cossacks
rode
past
petya
and
denisov
when
they
had
all
ridden
denisov
touched
his
horse
and
rode
down
the
hill
slipping
onto
their
haunches
and
sliding
the
horses
descended
with
their
riders
into
the
ravine
petya
rode
beside
denisov
the
pulsation
his
body
constantly
increasing
was
getting
lighter
and
lighter
but
the
mist
still
hid
distant

having
reached
the

denisov
looked
back
and
nodded
cossack
beside
him
the
signal
said
the
cossack
raised
his
arm
and
shot
rang
out
instant
the
tramp
horses
galloping
forward
was
heard
shouts
came
from
various
sides
and
then
more
shots
the
first
sound
trampling
hoofs
and
shouting
petya
lashed
his
horse
and
loosening
his
rein
galloped
forward
not
heeding
denisov
who
shouted
him
seemed
petya
that
the
moment
the
shot
was
fired
suddenly
became
bright
noon
galloped
the
bridge
cossacks
were
galloping
along
the
road
front
him
the
bridge
collided
with
cossack
who
had
fallen
behind
but
galloped
front
him
soldiers
probably
frenchmen
were
running
from
right
left
across
the
road
one
them
fell
the
mud
under
his
horse
feet
cossacks
were
crowding
about
hut
busy
with
something
from
the
midst
that
crowd
terrible
screams
arose
petya
galloped
and
the
first
thing
saw
was
the
pale
face
and
trembling
jaw
frenchman
clutching
the
handle
lance
that
had
been
aimed
him
hurrah
lads
ours
shouted
petya
and
giving
rein
his
excited
horse
galloped
forward
along
the
village
street
could
hear
shooting
ahead
him
cossacks
hussars
and
ragged
russian
prisoners
who
had
come
running
from
both
sides
the
road
were
shouting
something
loudly
and
incoherently
gallant
looking
frenchman
blue
overcoat
capless
and
with
frowning
red
face
had
been
defending
himself
against
the
hussars
when
petya
galloped
the
frenchman
had
already
fallen
too
late
again
flashed
through
petya
mind
and
galloped
the
place
from
which
the
rapid
firing
could
heard
the
shots
came
from
the
yard
the
landowner
house
had
visited
the
night
before
with
dolokhov
the
french
were
making
stand
there
behind
wattle
fence
garden
thickly
overgrown
with
bushes
and
were
firing
the
cossacks
who
crowded
the
gateway
through
the
smoke
approached
the
gate
petya
saw
dolokhov
whose
face
was
pale
greenish
tint
shouting
his
men
round
wait
for
the
infantry
exclaimed
petya
rode
him
wait
hurrah
shouted
petya
and
without
pausing
moment
galloped
the
place
whence
came
the
sounds
firing
and
where
the
smoke
was
thickest
volley
was
heard
and
some
bullets
whistled
past
while
others
plashed
against
something
the
cossacks
and
dolokhov
galloped
after
petya
into
the
gateway
the
courtyard
the
dense
wavering
smoke
some
the
french
threw
down
their
arms
and
ran
out
the
bushes
meet
the
cossacks
while
others
ran
down
the
hill
toward
the
pond
petya
was
galloping
along
the
courtyard
but
instead
holding
the
reins
waved
both
his
arms
about
rapidly
and
strangely
slipping
farther
and
farther
one
side
his
saddle
his
horse
having
galloped
campfire
that
was
smoldering
the
morning
light
stopped
suddenly
and
petya
fell
heavily
the
wet
ground
the
cossacks
saw
that
his
arms
and
legs
jerked
rapidly
though
his
head
was
quite
motionless
bullet
had
pierced
his
skull
after
speaking
the
senior
french
officer
who
came
out
the
house
with
white
handkerchief
tied
his
sword
and
announced
that
they
surrendered
dolokhov
dismounted
and
went
petya
who
lay
motionless
with
outstretched
arms
done
for
said
with
frown
and
went
the
gate
meet
denisov
who
was
riding
toward
him
killed
cried
denisov
recognizing
from
distance
the
unmistakably
lifeless
attitude
very
familiar
him
which
petya
body
was
lying
done
for
repeated
dolokhov
the
utterance
these
words
afforded
him
pleasure
and
went
quickly
the
prisoners
who
were
surrounded
cossacks
who
had
hurried
won
take
them
called
out
denisov
denisov
did
not
reply
rode
petya
dismounted
and
with
trembling
hands
turned
toward
himself
the
bloodstained
mud
bespattered
face
which
had
already
gone
white
used
something
sweet
raisins
fine
ones
take
them
all
recalled
petya
words
and
the
cossacks
looked
round
surprise
the
sound
like
the
yelp
dog
with
which
denisov
turned
away
walked
the
wattle
fence
and
seized
hold
among
the
russian
prisoners

chapter

during
the
whole
their
march
from
moscow
fresh
orders
had
been
issued
the
french
authorities
concerning
the
party

then

the
symptoms
disorder
that
pierre
had
noticed
their
first
halting
place
after
leaving
moscow
had
now
reached
the
utmost
limit
the
road
along
which
they
moved
was
bordered
both
sides
dead
horses
ragged
men
who
had
fallen
behind
from
various
regiments
continually
changed
about
now
joining
the
moving
column
now
again
lagging
behind
several
times
during
the
march
false
alarms
had
been
given
and
the
soldiers
the
escort
had
raised
their
muskets
fired
and
run
headlong
crushing
one
another
but
had
afterwards
reassembled
and
abused
each
other
for
their
causeless
panic
these
three
groups
traveling
together
the
cavalry
stores
the
convoy
prisoners
and
junot
baggage
train
still
constituted
separate
and
united
whole
though
each
the
groups
was
rapidly
melting
away
the
artillery
baggage
train
which
had
consisted
hundred
and
twenty
wagons
not
more
than
sixty
now
remained
the
rest
had
been
captured
left
behind
some
junot
wagons
also
had
been
captured
abandoned
three
wagons
had
been
raided
and
robbed
stragglers
from
davout
corps
from
the
talk
the
germans
pierre
learned
that
larger
guard
had
been
allotted
that
baggage
train
than
the
prisoners
and
that
one
their
comrades
german
soldier
had
been
shot
the
marshal
own
order
because
silver
spoon
belonging
the
marshal
had
been
found
his
possession
the
group
prisoners
had
melted
away
most
all
the
three
hundred
and
thirty
men
who
had
set
out
from
moscow
fewer
than
hundred
now
remained
the
prisoners
were
more
burdensome
the
escort
than
even
the
cavalry
saddles
junot
baggage
they
understood
that
the
saddles
and
junot
spoon
might
some
use
but
that
cold
and
hungry
soldiers
should
have
stand
and
guard
equally
cold
and
hungry
russians
who
froze
and
lagged
behind
the
road
which
case
the
order
was
shoot
them
was
not
merely
incomprehensible
but
revolting
and
the
escort
afraid
the
grievous
condition
they
themselves
were
giving
way
the
pity
they
felt
for
the
prisoners
and
rendering
their
own
plight
still
worse
treated
them
with
particular
moroseness
and
severity

while
the
soldiers
the

after
locking

had
gone

own

the
soldier
prisoners
tunneled
under
the
wall
and
ran
away
but
were

arrangement
adopted

they
started
that
the
officer

should
kept
separate
from
the
rest
had
long
since
been
abandoned
all
who
could
walk
went
together
and
after
the
third
stage
pierre
had
rejoined
karataev
and
the
gray
blue
bandy
legged
dog
that
had
chosen
karataev
for
its
master
the
third
day
after
leaving
moscow
karataev
again
fell
ill
with
the
fever
had
suffered
from
the
hospital
moscow
and
grew
gradually
weaker
pierre
kept
away
from
him
pierre
did
not
know
why
but
since
karataev
had
begun
grow
weaker
had
cost
him
effort
near
him
when
did
and
heard
the
subdued
moaning
with
which
karataev
generally
lay
down
the
halting
places
and
when
smelled
the
odor
emanating
from
him
which
was
now
stronger
than
before
pierre
moved
farther
away
and
did
not
think
about
him
while
imprisoned
the
shed
pierre
had
learned
not
with
his
intellect
but
with
his
whole
being
life
itself
that
man
created
for
happiness
that
happiness
within
him
the
satisfaction
simple
human
needs
and
that
all
unhappiness
arises
not
from
privation
but
from
superfluity
and
now
during
these
last
three
weeks
the
march
had
learned
still
another
new
consolatory
truth
that
nothing
this
world
terrible
had
learned
that
there
condition
which
man
can
happy
and
entirely
free
there
condition
which
need
unhappy
and
lack
freedom
learned
that
suffering
and
freedom
have
their
limits
and
that
those
limits
are
very
near
together
that
the
person
bed
roses
with
one
crumpled
petal
suffered
keenly
now
sleeping
the
bare
damp
earth
with
one
side
growing
chilled
while
the
other
was
warming
and
that
when
had
put
tight
dancing
shoes
had
suffered
just
did
now
when
walked
with
bare
feet
that
were
covered
with
sores
his
footgear
having
long
since
fallen
pieces
discovered
that
when
had
married
his
wife
his
own
free
will
had
seemed
him
had
been
more
free
than
now
when
they
locked
him
night
stable
all
that
himself
subsequently
termed
his
sufferings
but
which
the
time
scarcely
felt
the
worst
was
the
state
his
bare
raw
and
scab
covered
feet
the
horseflesh
was
appetizing
and
nourishing
the
saltpeter
flavor
the
gunpowder
they
used
instead
salt
was
even
pleasant
there
was
great
cold
was
always
warm
walking
the
daytime
and
night
there
were
the
campfires
the
lice
that
devoured
him
warmed
his
body
the
one
thing
that
was
first
hard
bear
was
his
feet
after
the
second
day
march
pierre
having
examined
his
feet
the
campfire
thought
would
impossible
walk
them
but
when
everybody
got
went
along
limping
and
when
had
warmed
walked
without
feeling
the
pain
though
night
his
feet
were
more
terrible
look
than
before
however
did
not
look
them
now
but
thought
other
things
only
now
did
pierre
realize
the
full
strength
life
man
and
the
saving
power
has
transferring
his
attention
from
one
thing
another
which
like
the
safety
valve
boiler
that
allows
superfluous
steam
blow
off
when
the
pressure
exceeds
certain
limit
did
not
see
and
did
not
hear
how
they
shot
the
prisoners
who
lagged
behind
though
more
than
hundred
perished
that
way
did
not
think
karataev
who
grew
weaker
every
day
and
evidently
would
soon
have
share
that
fate
still
less
did
pierre
think
about
himself
the
harder
his
position
became
and
the
more
terrible
the
future
the
more
independent
that
position
which
found
himself
were
the
joyful
and
comforting
thoughts
memories
and
imaginings
that
came
him
chapter
xiii
midday
the
twenty
second
october
pierre
was
going
uphill
along
the
muddy
slippery
road
looking
his
feet
and
the
roughness
the
way
occasionally
glanced
the
familiar
crowd
around
him
and
then
again
his
feet
the
former
and
the
latter
were
alike
familiar
and
his
own
the
blue
gray
bandy
legged
dog
ran
merrily
along
the
side
the
road
sometimes
proof
its
agility
and
self
satisfaction
lifting
one
hind
leg
and
hopping
along
three
and
then
again
going
all
four
and
rushing
bark
the
crows
that
sat
the
carrion
the
dog
was
merrier
and
sleeker
than
had
been
moscow
all
around
lay
the
flesh
different
animals
from
men
horses
various
stages
decomposition
and
the
wolves
were
kept
off
the
passing
men
the
dog
could
eat
all
wanted
had
been
raining
since
morning
and
had
seemed
any
moment
might
cease
and
the
sky
clear
but
after
short
break
began
raining
harder
than
before
the
saturated
road
longer
absorbed
the
water
which
ran
along
the
ruts
streams
pierre
walked
along
looking
from
side
side
counting
his
steps
threes
and
reckoning
them
off
his
fingers
mentally
addressing
the
rain
repeated
now
then
now
then
pelt
harder
seemed
him
that
was
thinking
nothing
but
far
down
and
deep
within
him
his
soul
was
occupied
with
something
important
and
comforting
this
something
was
most
subtle
spiritual
deduction
from
conversation
with
karataev
the
day
before
their
yesterday
halting
place
feeling
chilly
dying
campfire
pierre
had
got
and
gone
the
next
one
which
was
burning
better
there
platon
karataev
was
sitting
covered
head
and
all
with
his
greatcoat
were
vestment
telling
the
soldiers
his
effective
and
pleasant
though
now
feeble
voice
story
pierre
knew
was
already
past
midnight
the
hour
when
karataev
was
usually
free
his
fever
and
particularly
lively
when
pierre
reached
the
fire
and
heard
platon
voice
enfeebled
illness
and
saw
his
pathetic
face
brightly
lit
the
blaze
felt
painful
prick
his
heart
his
feeling
pity
for
this
man
frightened
him
and
wished
away
but
there
was
other
fire
and
pierre
sat
down
trying
not
look
platon
well
how
are
you
asked
how
grumble
sickness
god
won
grant
death
replied
platon
and
once
resumed
the
story
had
begun
and
brother
continued
with
smile
his
pale
emaciated
face
and
particularly
happy
light
his
eyes
you
see
brother
pierre
had
long
been
familiar
with
that
story
karataev
had
told
him
alone
some
half
dozen
times
and
always
with
specially
joyful
emotion
but
well
knew
pierre
now
listened
that
tale
something
new
and
the
quiet
rapture
karataev
evidently
felt
told
communicated
itself
also
pierre
the
story
was
old
merchant
who
lived
good
and
god
fearing
life
with
his
family
and
who
went
once
the
nizhni
fair
with
companion
rich
merchant
having
put
inn
they
both
went
sleep
and
next
morning
his
companion
was
found
robbed
and
with
his
throat
cut
bloodstained
knife
was
found
under
the
old
merchant
pillow
was
tried
knouted
and
his
nostrils
having
been
torn
off
all
due
form
karataev
put
was
sent
hard
labor

and
brother
was
this
point
that
pierre
came
ten
years
more
passed
the
old
man
was
living
convict
submitting
should
and
doing
wrong
only
prayed
god
for
death
well
one
night
the
convicts
were
gathered
just
are
with
the
old
man
among
them
and
they
began
telling
what
each
was
suffering
for
and
how
they
had
sinned
against
god
one
told
how
had
taken
life
another
had
taken
two
third
had
set
house
fire
while
another
had
simply
been
vagrant
and
had
done
nothing
they
asked
the
old
man
what
are
you
being
punished
for
daddy
dear
brothers
said
being
punished
for
own
and
other
men
sins
but
have
not
killed
anyone
taken
anything
that
was
not
mine
but
have
only
helped

merchant
dear

and
had
much
property
and
went
tell
them
all
about
due
order
don
grieve
for
myself
says
god
seems
has
chastened
only
sorry
for
old
wife
and
the
children
and
the
old
man
began
weep
now
happened
that
the
group
was
the
very
man
who
had
killed
the
other
merchant
where
did
happen
daddy
said
when
and
what
month
asked
all
about
and
his
heart
began
ache
comes
the
old
man
like
this
and
falls
down
his
feet
you
are
perishing
because
daddy
says
quite
true
lads
that
this
man
says
being
tortured
innocently
and
for
nothing
says
did
that
deed
and
put
the
knife
under
your
head
while
you
were
asleep
forgive
daddy
says
for
christ
sake
karataev
paused
smiling
joyously
gazed
into
the
fire
and
drew
the
logs
together
and
the
old
man
said
god
will
forgive
you
are
all
sinners
his
sight
suffer
for
own
sins
and
wept
bitter
tears
well
and
what
you
think
dear
friends
karataev
continued
his
face
brightening
more
and
more
with
rapturous
smile
what
now
had
tell
contained
the
chief
charm
and
the
whole
meaning
his
story
what
you
think
dear
fellows
that
murderer
confessed
the
authorities
have
taken
six
lives
says
was
great
sinner
but
what
most
sorry
for
this
old
man
don
let
him
suffer
because
confessed
and
was
all
written
down
and
the
papers
sent
off
due
form
the
place
was
long
way
off
and
while
they
were
judging
what
with
one
thing
and
another
filling
the
papers
all
due
form
the
authorities
mean
time
passed
the
affair
reached
the
tsar
after
while
the
tsar
decree
came
set
the
merchant
free
and
give
him
compensation
that
had
been
awarded
the
paper
arrived
and
they
began
look
for
the
old
man
where
the
old
man
who
has
been
suffering
innocently
and
vain
paper
has
come
from
the
tsar
they
began
looking
for
him
here
karataev
lower
jaw
trembled
but
god
had
already
forgiven
him
was
dead
that
how
was
dear
fellows
karataev
concluded
and
sat
for
long
time
silent
gazing
before
him
with
smile
and
pierre
soul
was
dimly
but
joyfully
filled
not
the
story
itself
but
its
mysterious
significance
the
rapturous
joy
that
lit
karataev
face
told
and
the
mystic
significance
that

and
pierre
saw
karataev
whom
had
not
yet
seen
that
morning
sat
his
short
overcoat
leaning
against
birch
tree
his
face
besides
the
look

had
worn
yesterday
while
telling
the

the

who
suffered

there
was
now

karataev
looked
pierre
with
his
kindly
round
eyes
now
filled
with
tears
evidently
wishing
him
come
near
that
might
say
something
him
but
pierre
was
not
sufficiently
sure
himself
made
did
not
notice
that
look
and
moved
hastily
away
when
the
prisoners
again
went
forward
pierre
looked
round
karataev
was
still
sitting
the
side
the
road
under
the
birch
tree
and
two
frenchmen
were
talking
over
his
head
pierre
did
not
look
round
again
but
went
limping
the
hill
from
behind
where
karataev
had
been
sitting
came
the
sound
shot
pierre
heard
plainly
but
that
moment
remembered
that
had
not
yet
finished
reckoning
how
many
stages
still
remained
smolensk
calculation
had
begun
before
the
marshal
went
and
again
started
reckoning
two
french
soldiers
ran
past
pierre
one
whom
carried
lowered
and
smoking
gun
they
both
looked
pale
and
the
expression
their
faces
one
them
glanced
timidly
pierre
there
was
something
resembling
what
had
seen
the
face
the
young
soldier

execution
pierre
looked
the
soldier
and
remembered
that
two
days
before
that
man
had
burned
his
shirt
while
drying
the
fire
and
how
they
had
laughed
him
behind
him
where
karataev
had
been
sitting
the
dog
began
howl
what
stupid
beast
why
howling
thought
pierre
his
comrades
the
prisoner
soldiers
walking
beside
him
avoided
looking
back
the
place
where
the
shot
had
been
fired
and
the

was
howling
just
pierre
did
but
there
was

and
suddenly
saw
vividly
before
him
long
forgotten
kindly
old
man
who
had
given
him
geography
lessons

wait
bit
said
the
old
man
and
showed
pierre
globe
this
globe
was
alive
vibrating
ball
without
fixed
dimensions
its
whole
surface
consisted
drops
closely
pressed
together
and
all
these
drops
moved
and
changed
places
sometimes
several
them
merging
into
one
sometimes
one
dividing
into
many
each
drop
tried
spread
out
and
occupy
much
space
possible
but
others
striving
the
same
compressed
sometimes
destroyed
and
sometimes
merged
with
that
life
said
the
old
teacher
how
simple
and
clear
thought
pierre
how
did
not
know
before
god
the
midst
and
each
drop
tries
expand
reflect
him
the
greatest
extent
and
grows
merges
disappears
from
the
surface
sinks
the
depths
and
again
emerges
there
now
karataev
has
spread
out
and
disappeared
you
understand

said
the
teacher
you

shouted
voice
and
pierre
woke
lifted
himself
and
sat

just

and
gazed
into
the

the
russian

the
frenchman
had

was
sitting
near
the

patting
something
with

pierre
recognized
the
blue

sitting
beside
the

wagging
its
tail
come
said
pierre
and
plat
began
but
did
not
finish
suddenly
and
simultaneously
crowd

awoke
his
fancy
the
look
platon
had
given
him

under

the
shot
heard
from
that
spot
the

howl
the
guilty
faces
the
two

they
ran
past
him
the
lowered
and
smoking
gun
and
karataev
absence
this
halt
and
was
the
point
realizing
that
karataev
had
been
killed

just
that
instant

not
why
the
recollection
came

without

drawing

from

pierre
closed
his
eyes
seeing
vision
the
country
summertime
mingled
with
memories
bathing
and
the
liquid
vibrating
globe
and
sank
into
water
that
closed
over
his
head
before
sunrise
was
awakened

and
loud
and
rapid
firing
french

were
running

him

chapter

what
russian
reading
the
account
the
last
part
the
campaign
has
not
experienced
uncomfortable
feeling
regret
dissatisfaction
and
perplexity
who
has
not
asked
himself
how
that
the
french
were
not
all
captured
destroyed
when
our
three
armies
surrounded
them
superior
numbers
when
the
disordered
french
hungry
and
freezing
surrendered
crowds
and
when
the
historians
relate
the
aim
the
russians
was
stop
the
french
cut
them
off
and
capture
them
all
how
was
that
the
russian
army
which
when
numerically
weaker
than
the
french
had
given
battle
borodino
did
not
achieve
its
purpose
when
had
surrounded
the
french
three
sides
and
when
its
aim
was
capture
them
can
the
french
enormously
superior
that
when
had
surrounded
them
with
superior
forces
could
not
beat
them
how
could
that
happen
history
what
called
that
name
replying
these
questions
says
that
this
occurred
because
kutuzov
and
tormasov
and
chichagov
and
this
man
and
that
man
did
not
execute
such
and
such
maneuvers
but
why
did
they
not
execute
those
maneuvers
and
why
they
were
guilty
not
carrying
out
prearranged
plan
were
they
not
tried
and
punished
but
even
admitted
that
kutuzov
chichagov
and
others
were
the
cause
the
russian
failures
still
incomprehensible
why
the
position
the
russian
army
being
what
was
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
both
cases
had
superior
forces
the
french
army
with
its
marshals
kings
and
emperor
was
not
captured
that
was
what
the
russians
aimed
the
explanation
this
strange
fact
given
russian
military
historians
the
effect
that
kutuzov
hindered
attack
unfounded
for
know
that
could
not
restrain
the
troops
from
attacking
vyazma
and
tarutino
why
was
the
russian
army
which
with
inferior
forces
had
withstood
the
enemy
full
strength
borodino
defeated
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
the
disorganized
crowds
the
french
when
was
numerically
superior
the
aim
the
russians
consisted
cutting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
and
his
marshals
and
that
aim
was
not
merely
frustrated
but
all
attempts
attain
were
most
shamefully
baffled
then
this
last
period
the
campaign
quite
rightly
considered
the
french
series
victories
and
quite
wrongly
considered
victorious
russian
historians
the
russian
military
historians
far
they
submit
claims
logic
must
admit
that
conclusion
and
spite
their
lyrical
rhapsodies
about
valor
devotion
and
forth
must
reluctantly
admit
that
the
french
retreat
from
moscow
was
series
victories
for
napoleon
and
defeats
for
kutuzov
but
putting
national
vanity
entirely
aside
one
feels
that
such
conclusion
involves
contradiction
since
the
series
french
victories
brought
the
french
complete
destruction
while
the
series
russian
defeats
led
the
total
destruction
their
enemy
and
the
liberation
their
country
the
source
this
contradiction
lies
the
fact
that
the
historians
studying
the
events
from
the
letters
the
sovereigns
and
the
generals
from
memoirs
reports
projects
and
forth
have
attributed
this
last
period
the
war
aim
that
never
existed
namely
that
cutting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
with
his
marshals
and
his
army
there
never
was
could
have
been
such
aim
for
would
have
been
senseless
and
its
attainment
quite
impossible
would
have
been
senseless
first
because
napoleon
disorganized
army
was
flying
from
russia
with
all
possible
speed
that
say
was
doing
just
what
every
russian
desired
what
was
the
use
performing
various
operations
the
french
who
were
running
away
fast
they
possibly
could
secondly
would
have
been
senseless
block
the
passage
men
whose
whole
energy
was
directed
flight
thirdly
would
have
been
senseless
sacrifice
one
own
troops
order
destroy
the
french
army
which
without
external
interference
was
destroying
itself
such
rate
that
though
its
path
was
not
blocked
could
not
carry
across
the
frontier
more
than
actually
did
december
namely
hundredth
part
the
original
army
fourthly
would
have
been
senseless
wish
take
captive
the
emperor
kings
and
dukes
whose
capture
would
have
been
the
highest
degree
embarrassing
for
the
russians
the
most
adroit
diplomatists
the
time
joseph
maistre
and
others
recognized
still
more
senseless
would
have
been
the
wish
capture
army
corps
the
french
when
our
own
army
had
melted
away
half
before
reaching
krasnoe
and
whole
division
would
have
been
needed
convoy
the
corps
prisoners
and
when
our
men
were
not
always
getting
full
rations
and
the
prisoners
already
taken
were
perishing
hunger
all
the
profound
plans
about
cutting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
and
his
army
were
like
the
plan
market
gardener
who
when
driving
out
his
garden
cow
that
had
trampled
down
the
beds
had
planted
should
run
the
gate
and
hit
the
cow
the
head
the
only
thing
said
excuse
that
gardener
would
that
was
very
angry
but
not
even
that
could
said
for
those
who
drew
this
project
for
was
not
they
who
had
suffered
from
the
trampled
beds
but
besides
the
fact
that
cutting
off
napoleon
with
his
army
would
have
been
senseless
was
impossible
was
impossible
first
because
experience
shows
that
three
mile
movement
columns
battlefield
never
coincides
with
the
plans
the
probability
chichagov
kutuzov
and
wittgenstein
effecting
junction
time
appointed
place
was
remote
tantamount
impossibility
fact
thought
kutuzov
who
when
received
the
plan
remarked
that
diversions
planned
over
great
distances
not
yield
the
desired
results
secondly
was
impossible
because
paralyze
the
momentum
with
which
napoleon
army
was
retiring
incomparably
greater
forces
than
the
russians
possessed
would
have
been
required
thirdly
was
impossible
because
the
military
term
cut
off
has
meaning
one
can
cut
off
slice
bread
but
not
army
cut
off
army
bar
its
road
quite
impossible
for
there
always
plenty
room
avoid
capture
and
there
the
night
when
nothing
can
seen
the
military
scientists
might
convince
themselves
the
example
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
only
possible
capture
prisoners
they
agree
captured
just
only
possible
catch
swallow
settles
one
hand
men
can
only
taken
prisoners
they
surrender
according
the
rules
strategy
and
tactics
the
germans
did
but
the
french
troops
quite
rightly
did
not
consider
that
this
suited
them
since
death
hunger
and
cold
awaited
them
flight
captivity
alike
fourthly
and
chiefly
was
impossible
because
never
since
the
world
began
has
war
been
fought
under
such
conditions
those
that
obtained
and
the
russian
army
its
pursuit
the
french
strained
its
strength
the
utmost
and
could
not
have
done
more
without
destroying
itself
during
the
movement
the
russian
army
from
tarutino
krasnoe
lost
fifty
thousand
sick
stragglers
that
number
equal
the
population
large
provincial
town
half
the
men
fell
out
the
army
without
battle
and
this
period
the
campaign
when
the
army
lacked
boots
and
sheepskin
coats
was
short
provisions
and
without
vodka
and
was
camping
out
night
for
months
the
snow
with
fifteen
degrees
frost
when
there
were
only
seven
eight
hours
daylight
and
the
rest
was
night
which
the
influence
discipline
cannot
maintained
when
men
were
taken
into
that
region
death
where
discipline
fails
not
for
few
hours
only
battle
but
for
months
where
they
were
every
moment
fighting
death
from
hunger
and
cold
when
half
the
army
perished
single
month
this
period
the
campaign
that
the
historians
tell
how
miloradovich
should
have
made
flank
march
such
and
such
place
tormasov
another
place
and
chichagov
should
have
crossed
more
than
knee
deep
snow
somewhere
else
and
how
and
routed
and
cut
off
the
french
and
and
the
russians
half
whom
died
did
all
that
could
and
should
have
been
done
attain
end
worthy
the
nation
and
they
are
not
blame
because
other
russians
sitting
warm
rooms
proposed
that
they
should
what
was
impossible
all
that
strange
contradiction
now
difficult
understand
between
the
facts
and
the
historical
accounts
only
arises
because
the
historians
dealing
with
the
matter
have
written
the
history
the
beautiful
words
and
sentiments
various
generals
and
not
the
history
the
events
them
the
words
miloradovich
seem
very
interesting
and
their
surmises
and
the
rewards
this
that
general
received
but
the
question
those
fifty
thousand
men
who
were
left
hospitals
and
graves
does
not
even
interest
them
for
does
not
come
within
the
range
their
investigation
yet
one
need
only
discard
the
study
the
reports
and
general
plans
and
consider
the
movement
those
hundreds
thousands
men
who
took
direct
part
the
events
and
all
the
questions
that
seemed
insoluble
easily
and
simply
receive
immediate
and
certain
solution
the
aim
cutting
off
napoleon
and
his
army
never
existed
except
the
imaginations
dozen
people
could
not
exist
because
was
senseless
and
unattainable
the
people
had
single
aim
free
their
land
from
invasion
that
aim
was
attained
the
first
place
itself
the
french
ran
away
and
was
only
necessary
not
stop
their
flight
secondly
was
attained
the
guerrilla
warfare
which
was
destroying
the
french
and
thirdly
the
fact
that
large
russian
army
was
following
the
french
ready
use
its
strength
case
their
movement
stopped
the
russian
army
had
act
like

her

absolute
and
independent
arbiter
her
own

and
guardian
and
instructor
her
nephew
was
the
first
called
back
life
from
that
realm
sorrow
which
she
had
dwelt
for
the
first
fortnight
she
received
letters
from
her
relations
which
she
had

the
room
which
little

been
put

damp
and
began

and
with
advice
and
suggestions
that
they
should
return

house

vozdvizhenka
street
which
had
remained
uninjured
and
needed
only
slight
repairs
life
did
not
stand
still
and
was
necessary
live
hard
was
for
princess
mary
emerge
from
the
realm
secluded
contemplation
which
she
had
lived
till
then
and
sorry
and
almost
ashamed
she
felt
leave
natasha
alone
yet
the
cares
life
demanded
her
attention
and
she
involuntarily
yielded
them
she
went
through
the
accounts
with
alpatych
conferred
with
dessalles
about
her
nephew
and
gave
orders
and
made
preparations
for
the
journey
moscow
natasha
remained
alone
and
from
the
time
princess
mary
began
making
preparations
for
departure
held
aloof
from
her
too
princess
mary
asked
the
countess
let
natasha
with
her
moscow
and
both
parents
gladly
accepted
this
offer
for
they
saw
their
daughter
losing
strength
every
day
and
thought
that
change
scene
and
the
advice
moscow
doctors
would
good
for
her
not
going
anywhere
natasha
replied
when
this
was
proposed
her
please
just
leave
alone
and
she
ran
out
the
room
with
difficulty
refraining
from
tears
vexation
and
irritation
rather
than
sorrow
after
she
felt
herself
deserted
princes
mary
and
alone
her
grief
natasha
spent
most
the
time
her
room
herself
sitting
huddled
feet
and
all
the
corner
the
sofa
tearing
and
twisting
something
with
her
slender
nervous
fingers
and
gazing
intently
and
fixedly
whatever
her
eyes
chanced
fall
this
solitude
exhausted
and
tormented
her
but
she
was
absolute
need
soon
anyone
entered
she
got
quickly
changed
her
position
and
expression
and
picked
book
some
sewing
evidently
waiting
impatiently
for
the
intruder
she
felt
all
the
time
she
might
any
moment
penetrate
that
which
with
terrible
questioning
too
great
for
her
strength
her
spiritual
gaze
was
fixed
one
day
toward
the
end
december
natasha
pale
and
thin
dressed
black
woolen
gown
her
plaited
hair
negligently
twisted
into
knot
was
crouched
feet
and
all
the
corner
her
sofa
nervously
crumpling
and
smoothing
out
the
end
her
sash
while
she
looked
corner
the
door
she
was
gazing
the
direction
which
had
gone
the
other
side
life
and
that
other
side
life
which
she
had
never
before
thought
and
which
had
formerly
seemed
her
far
away
and
improbable
was
now
nearer
and
more
akin
and
more
comprehensible
than
this
side
life
where
everything
was
either
emptiness
and
desolation
suffering
and
indignity
she
was
gazing
where
she
knew
him
but
she
could
not
imagine
him
otherwise
than
had
been
here
she
now
saw
him
again
had
been
mytishchi
troitsa
and
yaroslavl
she
saw
his
face
heard
his
voice
repeated
his
words
and
her
own
and
sometimes
devised
other
words
they
might
have
spoken
there
lying
back
armchair
his
velvet
cloak
leaning
his
head
his
thin
pale
hand
his
chest
dreadfully
hollow
and
his
shoulders
raised
his
lips
are
firmly
closed
his
eyes
glitter
and
wrinkle
comes
and
goes
his
pale
forehead
one
his
legs
twitches
just
perceptibly
but
rapidly
natasha
knows
that
struggling
with
terrible
pain
what
that
pain
like
why
does
have
that
pain
what
does
feel
how
does
hurt
him
thought
natasha
noticed
her
watching
him
raised
his
eyes
and
began
speak
seriously
one
thing
would
terrible
said
bind
oneself
forever
suffering
man
would
continual
torture
and
looked
searchingly
her
natasha
usual
answered
before
she
had
time
think
what
she
would
say
she
said
this
can
won
you
will
get
well
quite
well
she
now
saw
him
from
the
commencement
that
scene
and
relived
what
she
had
then
felt
she
recalled
his
long
sad
and
severe
look
those
words
and
understood
the
meaning
the
rebuke
and
despair
that
protracted
gaze
agreed
natasha
now
said
herself
that
would
dreadful
always
continued
suffer
said
then
only
because
would
have
been
dreadful
for
him
but
understood
differently
thought
would
dreadful
for
then
still
wished
live
and
feared
death
and
said
awkwardly
and
stupidly
did
not
say
what
meant
thought
quite
differently
had
said
what
thought
should
have
said
even
had
dying
die
continually
before
eyes
should
have
been
happy
compared
with
what
now
now
there
nothing
nobody
did
know
that
did
not
and
never
will
know
and
now
will
never
never
possible
put
right
and
now
again
seemed
saying
the
same
words
her
only
her
imagination
natasha
this
time
gave
him
different
answer
she
stopped
him
and
said
terrible
for
you
but
not
for
you
know
that
for
there
nothing
life
but
you
and
suffer
with
you
the
greatest
happiness
for
and
took
her
hand
and
pressed
had
pressed
that
terrible
evening
four
days
before
his
death
and
her
imagination
she
said
other
tender
and
loving
words
which
she
might
have
said
then
but
only
spoke
now
love
thee
thee
love
love
she
said
convulsively
pressing
her
hands
and
setting
her
teeth
with
desperate
effort
she
was
overcome
sweet
sorrow
and
tears
were
already
rising
her
eyes
then
she
suddenly
asked
herself
whom
she
was
saying
this
again
everything
was
shrouded
hard
dry
perplexity
and
again
with
strained
frown
she
peered
toward
the
world
where
was
and
now
now
seemed
her
she
was
penetrating
the
mystery
but
the
instant
when
seemed
that
the
incomprehensible
was
revealing
itself
her
loud
rattle
the
door
handle
struck
painfully
her
ears
dunyasha
her
maid
entered
the
room
quickly
and
abruptly
with
frightened
look
her
face
and
showing
concern
for
her
mistress
come

she
with
strange
excited
look
misfortune
about

ilynich

she
finished
with
sob
chapter
besides
feeling
aloofness
from
everybody
natasha
was
feeling
special
estrangement
from
the
members
her
own
family
all
them
her
father
mother
and
sonya
were
near
her
familiar
commonplace
that
all
their
words
and
feelings
seemed
insult
the
world
which
she
had
been
living
late
and
she
felt
not
merely
indifferent
them
but
regarded
them
with
hostility
she
heard
dunyasha
words
about
peter
ilynich
and
misfortune
but
did
not
grasp
them
what
misfortune
what
misfortune
can
happen
them
they
just
live
their
own
old
quiet
and
commonplace
life
thought
natasha
she
entered
the
ballroom
her
father
was
hurriedly
coming
out
her
mother
room
his
face
was
puckered
and
wet
with
tears
had
evidently
run
out
that
room
give
vent
the
sobs
that
were
choking
him
when
saw
natasha
waved
his
arms
despairingly
and
burst
into
convulsively
painful
sobs
that
distorted
his
soft
round
face
petya
she
calling
and
weeping
like
child
and
quickly
shuffling
his
feeble
legs
chair
almost
fell
into
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
suddenly
electric
shock
seemed
run
through
natasha
whole
being
terrible
anguish
struck
her
heart
she
felt
dreadful
ache
something
was
being
torn
inside
her
and
she
were
dying
but
the
pain
was
immediately
followed
feeling
release
from
the
oppressive
constraint
that
had
prevented
her
taking
part
life
the
sight
her
father
the
terribly
wild
cries
her
mother
that
she
heard
through
the
door
made
her
immediately
forget
herself
and
her
own
grief
she
ran
her
father
but
feebly
waved
his
arm
pointing
her
mother
door
princess
mary
pale
and
with
quivering
chin
came
out
from
that
room
and
taking
natasha
the
arm
said
something
her
natasha
neither
saw
nor
heard
her
she
went
with
rapid
steps
pausing
the
door
for
instant
struggling
with
herself
and
then
ran
her
mother
the
countess
was
lying
armchair
strange
and
awkward
position
stretching
out
and
beating
her
head
against
the
wall
sonya
and
the
maids
were
holding
her
arms
natasha
natasha
cried
the
countess
not
true
not
true
lying
natasha
she
shrieked
pushing
those
around
her
away
away
all
you
not
true
killed
not
true
natasha
put
one
knee
the
armchair
stooped
over
her
mother
embraced
her
and
with
unexpected
strength
raised
her
turned
her
face
toward
herself
and
clung
her
mummy
darling
here
dearest
mummy
she
kept
whispering
not
pausing
instant
she
did
not
let
her
mother
but
struggled
tenderly
with
her
demanded
pillow
and
hot
water
and
unfastened
and
tore
open
her
mother
dress
dearest
darling
mummy
precious
she
whispered
incessantly
kissing
her
head
her
hands
her
face
and
feeling
her
own
irrepressible
and
streaming
tears
tickling
her
nose
and
cheeks
the
countess
pressed
her
daughter
hand
closed
her
eyes
and
became
quiet
for
moment
suddenly
she
sat
with
unaccustomed
swiftness
glanced
vacantly
around
her
and
seeing
natasha
began
press
her
daughter
head
with
all
her
strength
then
she
turned
toward
her
daughter
face
which
was
wincing
with
pain
and
gazed
long
natasha
you
love
she
said
soft
trustful
whisper
natasha
you
would
not
deceive
you
tell
the
whole
truth
natasha
looked
her
with
eyes
full
tears
and
her
look
there
was
nothing
but
love
and
entreaty
for
forgiveness
darling
mummy
she
repeated
straining
all
the
power
her
love
find
some
way
taking
herself
the
excess
grief
that
crushed
her
mother
and
again
futile
struggle
with
reality
her
mother
refusing
believe
that
she
could
live
when
her
beloved
boy
was
killed
the
bloom
life
escaped
from
reality
into
world
delirium
natasha
did
not
remember
how
that
day
passed
nor
that
night
nor
the
next
day
and
night
she
did
not
sleep
and
did
not
leave
her
mother
her
persevering
and
patient
love
seemed
completely
surround
the
countess
every
moment
not
explaining
consoling
but
recalling
her
life
during
the
third
night
the
countess
kept
very
quiet
for
few
minutes
and
natasha
rested
her
head
the
arm
her
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
but
opened
them
again
hearing
the
bedstead
creak
the
countess
was
sitting
bed
and
speaking
softly
how
glad
you
have
come
you
are
tired
won
you
have
some
tea
natasha
went
her
you
have
improved
looks
and
grown
more
manly
continued
the
countess
taking
her
daughter
hand
mamma
what
are
you
saying
natasha
more
more
and
embracing
her
daughter
the
countess
began
weep
for
the
first
time
chapter
iii
princess
mary
postponed
her
departure
sonya
and
the
count
tried
replace
natasha
but
could
not
they
saw
that
she
alone
was
able
restrain
her
mother
from
unreasoning
despair
for
three
weeks
natasha
remained
constantly
her
mother
side
sleeping
lounge
chair
her
room
making
her
eat
and
drink
and
talking
her
incessantly
because
the
mere
sound
her
tender
caressing
tones
soothed
her
mother
the
mother
wounded
spirit
could
not
heal
petya
death
had
torn
from
her
half
her
life
when
the
news
petya
death
had
come
she
had
been
fresh
and
vigorous
woman
fifty
but
month
later
she
left
her
room
listless
old
woman
taking
interest
life
but
the
same
blow
that
almost
killed
the
countess
this
second
blow
restored
natasha
life
spiritual
wound
produced
rending
the
spiritual
body
like
physical
wound
and
strange
may
seem
just
deep
wound
may
heal
and
its
edges
join
physical
and
spiritual
wounds
alike
can
yet
heal
completely
only
the
result
vital
force
from
within
natasha
wound
healed
that
way
she
thought
her
life
was
ended
but
her
love
for
her
mother
unexpectedly
showed
her
that
the
essence
life
love
was
still
active
within
her
love
awoke
and
did
life
prince
andrew
last
days
had
bound
princess
mary
and
natasha
together
this
new
sorrow
brought
them
still
closer
one
another
princess
mary
put
off
her
departure
and
for
three
weeks
looked
after
natasha
she
had
been
sick
child
the
last
weeks
passed
her
mother
bedroom
had
strained
natasha
physical
strength
one
afternoon
noticing
natasha
shivering
with
fever
princess
mary
took
her
her
own
room
and
made
her
lie
down
the
bed
natasha
lay
down
but
when
princess
mary
had
drawn
the
blinds
and
was
going
away
she
called
her
back
don
want
sleep
mary
sit
little
you
are
tired
try
sleep
why
did
you
bring
away
she
will
asking
for
she
much
better
she
spoke
well
today
said
princess
mary
natasha
lay
the
bed
and
the
semidarkness
the
room
scanned
princess
mary
face
she
like
him
thought
natasha
yes
like
and
yet
not
like
but
she
quite
original
strange
new
and
unknown
and
she
loves
what
her
heart
all
that
good
but
how
what
her
mind
like
what
does
she
think
about
yes
she
splendid
mary
she
said
timidly
drawing
princess
mary
hand
herself
mary
you
mustn
think
wicked
mary
darling
how
love
you
let
quite
quite
friends
and
natasha
embracing
her
began
kissing
her
face
and
hands
making
princess
mary
feel
shy
but
happy
this
demonstration
her
feelings
from
that
day
tender
and
passionate
friendship
such
exists
only
between
women
was
established
between
princess
mary
and
natasha
they
were
continually
kissing
and
saying
tender
things
one
another
and
spent
most
their
time
together
when
one
went
out
the
other
became
restless
and
hastened
rejoin
her
together
they
felt
more
harmony
with
one
another
than
either
them
felt
with
herself
when
alone
feeling
stronger
than
friendship
sprang
between
them
exclusive
feeling
life
being
possible
only
each
other
presence
sometimes
they
were
silent
for
hours
sometimes
after
they
were
already
bed
they
would
begin
talking
and
till
morning
they
spoke
most
what
was
long
past
princess
mary
spoke
her
childhood
her
mother
her
father
and
her
daydreams
and
natasha
who
with
passive
lack
understanding
had
formerly
turned
away
from
that
life
devotion
submission
and
the
poetry
christian
self
sacrifice
now
feeling
herself
bound
princess
mary
affection
learned
love
her
past
too
and
understand
side
life
previously
incomprehensible
her
she
did
not
think
applying
submission
and
self
abnegation
her
own
life
for
she
was
accustomed
seek
other
joys
but
she
understood
and
loved
another
those
previously
incomprehensible
virtues
for
princess
mary
listening
natasha
tales
childhood
and
early
youth
there
also
opened
out
new
and
hitherto
uncomprehended
side
life
belief
life
and
its
enjoyment
just
before
they
never
mentioned
him
not
lower
they
thought
their
exalted
feelings
words
but
this
silence
about
him
had
the
effect
making
them
gradually
begin
forget
him
without
being
conscious
natasha
had
grown
thin
and
pale
and
physically
weak
that
they
all
talked
about
her
health
and
this
pleased
her
but
sometimes
she
was
suddenly
overcome
fear
not
only
death
but
sickness
weakness
and
loss
good
looks
and
involuntarily
she
examined
her
bare
arm
carefully
surprised
its
thinness
and
the
morning
noticed
her
drawn
and
seemed
her
piteous
face
her
glass
seemed
her
that
things
must
and
yet
was
dreadfully
sad
one
day
she
went
quickly
upstairs
and
found
herself
out
breath
unconsciously
she
immediately
invented
reason
for
going
down
and
then
testing
her
strength
ran
upstairs
again
observing
the
result
another
time
when
she
called
dunyasha
her
voice
trembled
she
called
again
though
she
could
hear
dunyasha
coming
called
her
the
deep
chest
tones
which
she
had
been
wont
sing
and
listened
attentively
herself
she
did
not
know
and
would
not
have
believed
but
beneath
the
layer
slime
that
covered
her
soul
and
seemed
her
impenetrable
delicate
young
shoots
grass
were
already
sprouting
which
taking
root
would
cover
with
their
living
verdure
the
grief
that
weighed
her
down
that
would
soon
longer

the
wound
had
begun
heal
from
within

the

reliable
the
men
the
russian
army
were
worn
out
this
continuous
marching
the
rate
twenty
seven
miles
day
that
they
could
not
any
faster
realize
the
degree
exhaustion
the
russian
army
only
necessary
grasp
clearly
the
meaning
the
fact
that
while
not
losing
more
than
five
thousand
killed
and
wounded
after
tarutino
and
less
than
hundred
prisoners
the
russian
army
which
left
that
place
hundred
thousand
strong
reached
krasnoe
with
only
fifty
thousand
the
rapidity
the
russian
pursuit
was
just
destructive
our
army
the
flight
the
french
was
theirs
the
only
difference
was
that
the
russian
army
moved
voluntarily
with
such
threat
destruction
hung
over
the
french
and
that
the
sick
frenchmen
were
left
behind
enemy
hands
while
the
sick
russians
left
behind
were
among
their
own
people
the
chief
cause
the
wastage
napoleon
army
was
the
rapidity
its
movement
and
convincing
proof
this
the
corresponding
decrease
the
russian
army
kutuzov
far
was
his
power
instead
trying
check
the
movement
the
french
was
desired
petersburg
and
the
russian
army
generals
directed
his
whole
activity
here
had
done
tarutino
and
vyazma
hastening
while
easing
the
movement
our
army
but
besides
this
since
the
exhaustion
and
enormous
diminution
the
army
caused
the
rapidity
the
advance
had
become
evident
another
reason
for
slackening
the
pace
and
delaying
presented
itself
kutuzov
the
aim
the
russian
army
was
pursue
the
french
the
road
the
french
would
take
was
unknown
and
the
closer
our
troops
trod
their
heels
the
greater
distance
they
had
cover
only
following
some
distance
could
one
cut
across
the
zigzag
path
the
french
all
the
artful
maneuvers
suggested
our
generals
meant
fresh
movements
the
army
and
lengthening
its
marches
whereas
the
only
reasonable
aim
was
shorten
those
marches
that
end
kutuzov
activity
was
directed
during
the
whole
campaign
from
moscow
vilna
not
casually
intermittently
but
consistently
that
never
once
deviated
from
kutuzov
felt
and
knew
not
reasoning
science
but
with
the
whole
his
russian
being
what
every
russian
soldier
felt
that
the
french
were
beaten
that
the
enemy
was
flying
and
must
driven
out
but
the
same
time
like
the
soldiers
realized
all
the
hardship
this
march
the
rapidity
which
was
unparalleled
for
such
time
the
year
but
the
generals
especially
the
foreign
ones
the
russian
army
who
wished
distinguish
themselves
astonish
somebody
and
for
some
reason
capture
king
duke
seemed
that
now
when
any
battle
must
horrible
and
senseless
was
the
very
time
fight
and
conquer
somebody
kutuzov
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
one
after
another
they
presented
projects
maneuvers
made
with
those
soldiers
ill
shod
insufficiently
clad
and
half
starved
who
within
month
and
without
fighting
battle
had
dwindled
half
their
number
and
who
the
best
the
flight
continued
would
have
greater
distance
than
they
had
already
traversed
before
they
reached
the
frontier
this
longing
distinguish
themselves
maneuver
overthrow
and
cut
off
showed
itself
particularly
whenever
the
russians
stumbled
the
french
army
was
krasnoe
where
they
expected
find

the
three
french
columns
and
stumbled
instead

disputed

were

with

they
much
regretted
not

taken
napoleon
least
marshal

reproached
one
another
and
especially
kutuzov
for
having
failed
these
men
carried
away
their
passions
were
but
blind
tools
the
most
melancholy
law
necessity
but
considered
themselves
heroes
and
imagined
that
they
were
accomplishing
most
noble
and
honorable
deed
they
blamed
kutuzov
and
said
that
from
the
very
beginning
the
campaign
had
prevented
their
vanquishing
napoleon
that
thought
nothing
but
satisfying
his
passions
and
would
not
advance
from
the
linen
factories
because
was
comfortable
there
that
krasnoe
checked
the
advance
because
learning
that
napoleon
was
there
had
quite
lost
his
head
and
that
was
probable
that
had
understanding
with
napoleon
and
had
been
bribed
him
and
and
not
only
did
his
contemporaries
carried
away
their
passions
talk
this
way
but
posterity
and
history
have
acclaimed
napoleon
grand
while
kutuzov
described
foreigners
crafty
dissolute
weak
old
courtier
and
russians
something
indefinite
sort
puppet
useful
only
because
had
russian
name
chapter
and
kutuzov
was
openly
accused
blundering
the
emperor
was
dissatisfied
with
him
and
history
recently
written
order
the
highest
authorities
said
that
kutuzov
was
cunning
court
liar
frightened
the
name
napoleon
and
that
his
blunders
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
deprived
the
russian

such
the
fate
not

the
russian

does
not
acknowledge
but
those
rare

always
solitary
individuals
who
discerning

submit
their
personal

the
hatred
and
contempt
the
crowd
punish
such
men
for

for

that
most

tool
history
who
never
anywhere
even

showed
human
dignity
napoleon
the
object

but
kutuzov
the
man
who
from
the
beginning
the
end
his

never

swerving

from
borodino
vilna
presented

exceptional

self

the

importance
what
was

kutuzov
seems
them
something
indefinite
and
pitiful
and
when
speaking
him
and
the
year
they
always
seem
little
ashamed
and
yet
difficult
imagine
historical
character
whose
activity
was
unswervingly
directed
single
aim
and
would
difficult
imagine
any
aim
more
worthy
more
consonant

the

still
more

would
find

accomplished
that
which
all

kutuzov
never
talked
forty
centuries
looking
down
from
the
pyramids
the
sacrifices
offered
for
the
fatherland
what
intended
accomplish
had
accomplished
general
said
nothing
about
himself
adopted

always
appeared
the
simplest
and
most
ordinary

and
said
the
simplest
and
most
ordinary
things
wrote
letters
his

and
madame
stael
read

liked
the
society
pretty
women
jested
with
generals
officers
and
soldiers
and
never
contradicted
those
who
tried
prove
anything
him
when
count
rostopchin
the
yauza
bridge
galloped
kutuzov
with
personal
reproaches
for
having
caused
the
destruction
moscow
and
said
how
was
you
promised
not
abandon
moscow
without
battle
kutuzov
replied
and
shall
not
abandon
moscow
without
battle
though
moscow
was
then
already
abandoned
when
arakcheev
coming
him
from
the
emperor
said
that
ermolov
ought
appointed
chief
the
artillery
kutuzov
replied
yes
was
just
saying
myself
though
moment
before
had
said
quite
the
contrary
what
did
matter
him
who
then
alone
amid
senseless
crowd
understood
the
whole
tremendous
significance
what
was
happening
what
did
matter
him
whether
rostopchin
attributed
the
calamities
moscow
him
himself
still
less
could
matter
him
who
was
appointed
chief
the
artillery
not
merely
these
cases
but
continually
did
that
old
man
who
experience
life
had
reached
the
conviction
that
thoughts
and
the
words
serving
their
expression
are
not
what
move
people
use
quite
meaningless
words
that
happened
enter
his
head
but
that
man
heedless
his
words
did
not
once
during
the
whole
time
his
activity
utter
one
word
inconsistent
with
the
single
aim
toward
which
moved
throughout
the
whole
war
obviously
spite
himself
very
diverse
circumstances
repeatedly
expressed
his
real
thoughts
with
the
bitter
conviction
that
would
not
understood
beginning
with
the
battle
borodino
from
which
time
his
disagreement
with
those
about
him
began
alone
said
that
the
battle
borodino
was
victory
and
repeated
this
both
verbally
and
his
dispatches
and
reports
the
time
his
death
alone
said
that
the

moscow
not
the
loss

there
can

alone
during
the
retreat
the
french
said
that
all
our
maneuvers
are
useless
everything
being
accomplished
itself
better
than
could
desire
that
the
enemy
must
offered
golden
bridge
that
neither
the
tarutino
the

nor
the
krasnoe
battles
were
necessary
that
must
keep
some

the

that
would
not

for

this

the

the

his
death

was

was
lost
and
despite
the
fact
that
for

have
retire
after
winning

was
unprecedented
alone
during
the
whole
retreat
insisted
that
battles

were
useless
then
should
not

that

chapter
the
fifth
november
was
the
first
day
what
called
the
battle
krasnoe
toward
evening
after
much
disputing
and
many
mistakes
made
generals
who
did
not
their
proper
places
and
after
adjutants
had
been
sent
about
with
counterorders
when
had
become
plain
that
the
enemy
was
everywhere
flight
and
that
there
could
and
would
battle
kutuzov
left
krasnoe
and
went
dobroe
whither
his
headquarters
had
that
day
been
transferred
the
day
was
clear
and
frosty
kutuzov
rode
dobroe
his
plump
little
white
horse
followed
enormous
suite
discontented
generals
who
whispered
among
themselves
behind
his
back
all
along
the
road
groups
french
prisoners
captured
that
day
there
were
seven
thousand

were
crowding
warm
themselves

near

tattered

buzzing
with
talk
and
wrapped
and

they
had
been

standing
the
road
beside
long
row
unharnessed
french
guns
the
approach
the
commander

the
buzz
talk
ceased
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
kutuzov
who
wearing
white
cap
with
red
band
and
padded
overcoat
that
bulged
his
round
shoulders
moved
slowly
along
the
road
his
white
horse
one
the
generals
was
reporting
him
where
the
guns
and
prisoners
had
been
captured
kutuzov
seemed
preoccupied
and
did
not
listen
what
the
general
was
saying
screwed
his
eyes
with
dissatisfied
look
gazed
attentively
and
fixedly
these
prisoners
who
presented
specially
wretched
appearance
most
them
were
disfigured
frost
bitten
noses
and
cheeks
and
nearly
all
had
red
swollen
and
festering
eyes
one
group
the
french
stood
close
the
road
and
two
them
one
whom
had
his
face
covered
with
sores
were
tearing
piece
raw
flesh
with
their
hands
there
was
something
horrible
and
bestial
the
fleeting
glance
they
threw
the
riders
and
the
malevolent
expression
with
which
after
glance
kutuzov
the
soldier
with
the
sores
immediately
turned
away
and
went
with
what
was
doing
kutuzov
looked
long
and
intently
these
two
soldiers
puckered
his
face
screwed
his
eyes
and
pensively
swayed
his
head
another
spot
noticed
russian
soldier
laughingly
patting
frenchman
the
shoulder
saying
something
him
friendly
manner
and
kutuzov
with
the
same
expression
his
face
again
swayed
his
head
what
were
you
saying
asked
the
general
who
continuing
his
report
directed
the
commander
chief
attention
some
standards
captured
from
the
french
and
standing
front
the
preobrazhensk
regiment
the
standards
said
kutuzov
evidently
detaching
himself
with
difficulty
from
the
thoughts
that
preoccupied
him
looked
about
him
absently
thousands
eyes
were
looking
him
from
all
sides
awaiting
word
from
him
stopped
front
the
preobrazhensk
regiment
sighed
deeply
and
closed
his
eyes
one
his
suite
beckoned
the
soldiers
carrying
the
standards
advance
and
surround
the
commander
chief
with
them
kutuzov
was
silent
for
few
seconds
and
then
submitting
with
evident
reluctance
the
duty
imposed
his
position
raised
his
head
and
began
speak
throng
officers
surrounded
him
looked
attentively
around
the
circle
officers
recognizing
several
them
thank
you
all
said
addressing
the
soldiers
and
then
again
the
officers
the
stillness
around
him
his
slowly
uttered
words
were
distinctly
heard
thank
you
all
for
your
hard
and
faithful
service
the
victory
complete
and
russia
will
not
forget
you
honor
you
forever
paused
and
looked
around

added
addressing

with

his

roared
thousands
voices
while
the
soldiers
were
shouting
kutuzov
leaned
forward
his
saddle
and
bowed
his
head
and
his
eye
lit
with
mild
and
apparently
ironic
gleam
you
see
brothers
said
when
the
shouts
had
ceased
and
all
once
his
voice
and
the
expression
his
face
changed
was
longer
the
commander
chief
speaking
but
ordinary
old
man
who
wanted
tell
his
comrades
something
very
important
there
was
stir
among
the
throng
officers
and
the
ranks
the
soldiers
who
moved
that
they
might
hear
better
what
was
going
say
you
see
brothers
know
hard
for
you
but
can
helped
bear
won
for
long
now
see
our
visitors
off
and
then
rest
the
tsar
won
forget
your
service
hard
for
you
but
still
you
are
home
while
they
you
see
what
they
have
come
said
pointing
the
prisoners
worse
off
than
our
poorest
beggars
while
they
were
strong
didn
spare
ourselves
but
now
may
even
pity
them
they
are
human
beings
too
isn
lads
looked
around
and
the
direct
respectful
wondering
gaze
fixed
upon
him
read
sympathy
with
what
had
said
his
face
grew
brighter
and
brighter
with
old
man
mild
smile
which
drew
the
corners
his
lips
and
eyes
into
cluster
wrinkles
ceased
speaking
and
bowed
his
head
perplexity
but
after
all
who
asked
them

suddenly
lifting
his
head
and
flourishing
his
whip
rode
off
gallop
for
the
first
time
during
the
whole
campaign
and
left
the
broken
ranks
the
soldiers
laughing
joyfully
and
shouting
hurrah
kutuzov
words
were
hardly
understood
the
troops
one
could
have
repeated
the
field
marshal
address
begun
solemnly
and
then
changing
into
old
man
simplehearted
talk
but
the
hearty
sincerity
that
speech
the
feeling
majestic
triumph
combined
with
pity
for
the
foe
and
consciousness
the
justice
our
cause
exactly
expressed
that
old
man
good
natured
expletives
was
not
merely
understood
but
lay
the
soul
every
soldier
and
found
expression
their
joyous
and
long
sustained
shouts
afterwards
when
one
the
generals
addressed
kutuzov
asking
whether
wished
his
caleche
sent
for
kutuzov
answering
unexpectedly
gave

cried
the

the
huge

seen
swaying

the
night

the

away
twenty
voices
roared
out
once
that
all
together
heave
away
boys
but
despite
their
united
efforts
the
wattle
hardly
moved
and
the
silence
that
followed
the
heavy
breathing
the
men
was
audible

laughing
voice
and
moderating
their
tones
the
men
moved
forward
when
they
were
out
the
village
they
began
talking
again
loud
before
interlarding
their
talk
with
the
same
aimless
expletives
the
hut
which
the
men
had
passed
the
chief

had
gathered

the

the
snow
was
melting
and
black
shadows
soldiers
flitted

fro
all
over
the
occupied
space
where
the

chapter
viii
one
would
have
thought
that
under
the
almost
incredibly
wretched
conditions
the
russian
soldiers
were
that
time
lacking
warm
boots
and
sheepskin
coats
without
roof
over
their
heads
the
snow
with
eighteen
degrees
frost
and
without
even
full
rations
the
commissariat
did
not
always
keep
with
the
troops
they
would
have
presented
very
sad
and
depressing
spectacle
the
contrary
the
army
had
never
under
the
best
material
conditions
presented
more
cheerful
and
animated
aspect
this
was
because
all
who
began
grow
depressed
who
lost
strength
were
sifted
out
the
army
day
day
all
the
physically
morally
weak
had
long
since
been
left
behind
and
only
the
flower
the
army
physically
and
mentally
remained
more
men
collected
behind
the
wattle
fence
the
eighth
company
than
anywhere
else
two
sergeants
major
were
sitting
with
them
and
their
campfire
blazed
brighter
than
others
for
leave
sit
their
wattle
they
demanded
contributions

makeev
what

eyes
and
blinking
because
the
smoke
but
not
moving
back
from
the
fire
and
you

wood
said
another
soldier
this
red
haired
man
was
neither
sergeant
nor
corporal
but
being
robust
ordered
about
those
weaker
than
himself
the
soldier
they
called
jackdaw
thin
little
fellow
with
sharp
nose
rose
obediently
and
was
about
but
that
instant
there
came
into
the
light
the
fire
the
slender
handsome
figure
young
soldier
carrying
load
wood
bring
here
that
fine
they
split
the
wood
pressed
down
the
fire
blew
with
their
mouths
and
fanned
with
the
skirts
their
greatcoats
making
the
flames
hiss
and
crackle
the
men
drew
nearer
and
lit
their
pipes
the
handsome
young
soldier
who
had
brought
the
wood
setting
his
arms
akimbo
began
stamping
his
cold
feet
rapidly
and
deftly
the
spot
where
stood
mother
the
dew
cold
but
clear
well
that
musketeer
sang
pretending
hiccough
after
each
syllable
look
out
your
soles
will
fly
off
shouted
the
red
haired
man
noticing
that
the
sole
the
dancer
boot
was
hanging
loose
what
fellow
you
are
for
dancing
the
dancer
stopped
pulled
off
the
loose
piece
leather
and
threw
the
fire
right
enough
friend
said
and
having
sat
down
took
out
his
knapsack
scrap
blue
french
cloth
and
wrapped
round
his
foot
the
steam
that
spoils
them
added
stretching
out
his
feet
toward
the
fire
they
soon
issuing
new
ones
they
say
that
when
finished
hammering
them
receive
double
kits
and
that
son
bitch
petrov
has
lagged
behind
after
all
seems
said
one
sergeant
major
had
eye
him
this
long
while
said
the
other
well
poor
sort
soldier
but
the
third
company
they
say
nine
men
were
missing
yesterday
yes
all
very
well
but
when
man
feet
are
frozen
how
can
walk
don
talk
nonsense
said
sergeant
major
you
want
doing
the
same
said
old
soldier
turning
reproachfully
the
man
who
had
spoken
frozen
feet
well
you
know
said
the
sharp
nosed
man
they
called
jackdaw
squeaky
and
unsteady
voice
raising
himself
the
other
side
the
fire
plump
man
gets
thin
but
for
thin
one
death
take
now
got
strength

added
with
sudden
resolution
turning
the
sergeant
major
tell
them
send
hospital
aching
all
over
anyway
shan
able
keep
that
that
replied
the
sergeant
major
quietly
the
soldier
said
more
and
the
talk
went
what
lot
those
frenchies
were
taken
today
and
the
fact
that
not
one
them
had
what
you
might
call
real
boots
said
soldier
starting
new
theme
they
were
more
than
make
believes
the
cossacks
have
taken
their
boots
they
were
clearing
the
hut
for
the
colonel
and
carried
them
out
was
pitiful
see
them
boys
put
the
dancer
they
turned
them
over
one
seemed
still
alive
and
would
you
believe
jabbered
something
their
lingo
but
they
clean
folk
lads
the
first
man
went
was
white
white
birchbark
and
some
them
are
such
fine
fellows
you
might
think
they
were
nobles
well
what
you
think
they
make
soldiers
all
classes
there
but
they
don
understand
our
talk
all
said
the
dancer
with
puzzled
smile
asked
him
whose
subject
was
and
jabbered
his
own
way
queer
lot
but
strange
friends
continued
the
man
who
had
wondered
their
whiteness
the
peasants
mozhaysk
were
saying
that
when
they
began
burying
the
dead
where
the
battle
was
you
know
well
those
dead
had
been
lying
there
for
nearly
month
and
says
the
peasant
they
lie
white
paper
clean
and
not
much
smell
puff
powder
smoke
was
from
the
cold
asked
someone
you

fellow
from
the
cold

not
have

hardly
but
theirs
says
are
white
paper
and
not
much
smell
whiff
gunpowder
all
were
silent
must
from
their
food
said
the
sergeant
major
they
used
gobble
the
same
food
the
gentry
one
contradicted
him
that
peasant
near
mozhaysk
where
the
battle
was
said
the
men
were
all
called
from
ten
villages
around
and
they
carted
for
twenty
days
and
still
didn
finish
carting
the
dead
away
and
for
the
wolves
says
that
was
real

said
old
soldier
the
only
one
worth
remembering
but
since

folk
and
you

the
day
before

knees

remarked
the
old
soldier
yawning
the
conversation
flagged
and
the
soldiers
began
settling
down
sleep
look
the
stars
wonderful
how
they
shine
you
would
think
the
women
had
spread
out
their
linen
said
one
the
men
gazing
with
admiration
the
milky
way
that
sign

more
wood

fire
only
for
you
look
how
sprawling
the
silence
that
ensued
the
snoring
those
who
had
fallen
asleep
could
heard
others
turned
over
and
warmed
themselves
now
and
again
exchanging
few
words
from
campfire
hundred
paces
off
came
sound
general
merry
laughter
hark
them
roaring
there
the
fifth
company
said
one
the
soldiers
and
what
lot
them
there
are
one
the
men
got
and
went
over
the
fifth
company
they
having
such
fun
said
coming
back
two
frenchies
have
turned
one
quite
frozen
and
the
other
awful
swaggerer
singing
songs
across
and
have
look
and
several
the
men
went
over
the
fifth
company
chapter
the
fifth
company
was
bivouacking
the
very
edge
the
forest
huge
campfire
was
blazing
brightly
the
midst
the
snow
lighting
the
branches
trees
heavy
with
hoarfrost
about
midnight
they
heard
the
sound
steps
the
snow
the
forest
and
the
crackling
dry
branches
bear
lads
said
one
the
men
they
all
raised
their
heads
listen
and
out
the
forest
into
the
bright
firelight
stepped
two
strangely
clad
human
figures
clinging
one
another
these
were
two
frenchmen
who
had
been
hiding
the
forest
they
came
the
fire
hoarsely
uttering
something
language
our
soldiers
did
not
understand
one
was
taller
than
the
other
wore
officer
hat
and
seemed
quite
exhausted
approaching
the
fire
had
been
going
sit
down
but
fell
the
other
short
sturdy
soldier
with
shawl
tied
round
his
head
was
stronger
raised
his
companion
and
said
something
pointing
his
mouth
the
soldiers
surrounded
the
frenchmen
spread
greatcoat
the
ground
for
the
sick
man
and
brought
some
buckwheat
porridge
and
vodka
for
both
them
the
exhausted
french
officer
was
ramballe
and
the
man
with
his
head
wrapped
the
shawl
was
morel
his
orderly
when
morel
had
drunk
some
vodka
and
finished
his
bowl
porridge
suddenly
became
unnaturally
merry
and
chattered
incessantly
the
soldiers
who
could
not
understand
him
ramballe
refused
food
and
resting
his
head
his
elbow
lay
silent
beside
the
campfire
looking
the
russian
soldiers
with
red
and
vacant
eyes
occasionally
emitted
long
drawn
groan
and
then
again
became
silent
morel
pointing
his
shoulders
tried
impress
the
soldiers
the
fact
that
ramballe
was
officer
and
ought
warmed
russian
officer
who
had
come
the
fire
sent
ask
his
colonel
whether
would
not
take
french
officer
into
his
hut
warm
him
and
when
the
messenger
returned
and
said
that
the
colonel
wished
the
officer
brought
him
ramballe
was
told
rose
and
tried
walk
but
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
soldier
standing
held
him
you
won
again
said
one
the
soldiers
winking
and
turning
mockingly
ramballe
you
fool
why
talk
rubbish
lout
that
you
are
real
peasant
came
rebukes
from
all
sides
addressed
the
jesting
soldier
they
surrounded
ramballe
lifted
him
the
crossed
arms
two
soldiers
and
carried
him
the
hut
ramballe
put
his
arms
around
their
necks
while
they
carried
him
and
began
wailing
plaintively
you
fine
fellows
kind
kind
friends
these
are
men
brave
kind
friends
and
leaned
his
head
against
the
shoulder
one
the
men
like
child
meanwhile
morel
was
sitting
the
best
place
the
fire
surrounded
the
soldiers
morel
short
sturdy
frenchman
with
inflamed
and
streaming
eyes
was
wearing
woman
cloak
and
had

fashion
round
his
head
over
his
cap
was
evidently
tipsy
and
was
singing
french
song
hoarse
broken
voice
with
arm
thrown
round
the
nearest
soldier
the
soldiers
simply
held
their
sides
they
watched
him

really
catching

rose
their
rough
joyous

from

chapter
the
french
army
melted
away
the
uniform
rate
mathematical
progression
and
that
crossing
the
berezina
about
which
much
has
been
written
was
only
one
intermediate
stage
its
destruction
and
not
all
the
decisive
episode
the
campaign
much
has
been
and
still
written
about
the
berezina
the
french
side
this
only
because
the
broken
bridge
across
that
river
the
calamities
their
army
had
been
previously
enduring
were
suddenly
concentrated
one
moment
into
tragic
spectacle
that
remained
every
memory
and
the
russian
side
merely
because
petersburg
far
from
the
seat
war
plan
again
one
pfuel
had
been
devised
catch
napoleon
strategic
trap
the
berezina
river
everyone
assured
himself
that
all
would
happen
according
plan
and
therefore
insisted
that
was
just
the
crossing
the
berezina
that
destroyed
the
french
army
reality
the
results
the
crossing
were
much
less
disastrous
the
french
guns
and
men
lost
than
krasnoe
had
been
the
figures
show
the
sole
importance
the
crossing
the
berezina
lies
the
fact
that
plainly
and
indubitably
proved
the
fallacy
all
the
plans
for
cutting
off
the
enemy
retreat
and
the
soundness
the
only
possible
line
action
the
one
kutuzov
and
the
general
mass
the
army
demanded
namely
simply
follow
the
enemy
the
french
crowd
fled
continually
increasing
speed
and
all
its
energy
was
directed
reaching
its
goal
fled
like
wounded
animal
and
was
impossible
block
its
path
this
was
shown
not
much
the
arrangements
made
for
crossing
what
took
place
the
bridges
when
the
bridges
broke
down
unarmed
soldiers
people
from
moscow
and
women
with
children
who
were
with
the
french
transport
all
carried
vis
inertiae
pressed
forward
into
boats
and
into
the
ice
covered
water
and
did
not
surrender
that
impulse
was
reasonable
the
condition
fugitives
and
pursuers
was
equally
bad
long
they
remained
with
their
own
people
each
might
hope
for
help
from
his
fellows
and
the
definite
place
held
among
them
but
those
who
surrendered
while
remaining
the
same
pitiful
plight
would
lower
level
claim
share
the
necessities
life
the
french
did
not
need
informed
the
fact
that
half
the
prisoners
with
whom
the
russians
did
not
know
what
perished
cold
and
hunger
despite
their
captors
desire
save
them
they
felt
that
could
not
otherwise
the
most
compassionate
russian
commanders
those
favorable
the
french
and
even
the
frenchmen
the
russian
service
could
nothing
for
the
prisoners
the
french
perished
from
the
conditions
which
the
russian
army
was
itself
exposed
was
impossible
take
bread
and
clothes
from
our
hungry
and
indispensable
soldiers
give
the
french
who
though
not
harmful
hated
guilty
were
simply
unnecessary
some
russians
even
did
that
but
they
were
exceptions
certain
destruction
lay
behind
the
french
but
front
there
was
hope
their
ships
had
been
burned
there
was
salvation
save
collective
flight
and
that
the
whole
strength
the
french
was
concentrated
the
farther
they
fled
the
more
wretched
became
the
plight
the
remnant
especially
after
the
berezina
which
consequence
the
petersburg
plan
special
hopes
had
been
placed
the
russians
and
the
keener
grew
the
passions
the
russian
commanders
who
blamed
one
another
and
kutuzov
most
all
anticipation
that
the
failure
the
petersburg
berezina
plan
would
attributed
kutuzov
led
dissatisfaction
contempt
and
ridicule
more
and
more
strongly
expressed
the
ridicule
and
contempt
were
course
expressed
respectful
form
making
impossible
for
him
ask
wherein
was
blame
they
did
not
talk
seriously
him
when
reporting
him
asking
for
his
sanction
they
appeared
fulfilling
regrettable
formality
but
they
winked
behind
his
back
and
tried
mislead
him
every
turn
because
they
could
not
understand
him
all
these
people
assumed
that
was
useless
talk
the
old
man
that
would
never
grasp
the
profundity
their
plans
that
would
answer
with
his
phrases
which
they
thought
were
mere
phrases
about
golden
bridge
about
the
impossibility
crossing
the
frontier
with
crowd
tatterdemalions
and
forth
they
had
heard
all
that
before
and
all
said
that
was
necessary
await
provisions
that
the
men
had
boots
was
simple
while
what
they
proposed
was
complicated
and
clever
that
was
evident
that
was
old
and
stupid
and
that
they
though
not
power
were
commanders
genius
after
the
junction
with
the
army
the
brilliant
admiral
and
petersburg
hero
wittgenstein
this
mood
and
the
gossip
the
staff
reached
their
maximum
kutuzov
saw
this
and
merely
sighed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
only
once
after
the
affair
the
berezina
did
get
angry
and
write
bennigsen
who
reported
separately
the
emperor
the
following
letter
account
your
spells
ill
health
will
your
excellency
please
good
set
off
for
kaluga
receipt
this
and
there
await
further
commands
and
appointments
from
his
imperial
majesty
but
after
bennigsen
departure
the
grand
duke
tsarevich
constantine
pavlovich
joined
the
army
had
taken
part
the
beginning
the
campaign
but
had
subsequently
been
removed
from
the
army
kutuzov
now
having
come
the
army
informed
kutuzov
the
emperor
displeasure
the
poor
success
our
forces
and
the
slowness
their
advance
the
emperor
intended
join
the
army
personally
few
days
time
the
old
man
experienced
court
well
military
affairs
this
same
kutuzov
who
august
had
been
chosen
commander
chief
against
the
sovereign
wishes
and
who
had
removed
the
grand
duke
and
heir
apparent
from
the
army
who
his
own
authority
and
contrary
the
emperor
will
had
decided
the
abandonment
moscow
now
realized
once
that
his
day
was
over
that
his
part
was
played
and
that
the
power
was
supposed
hold
was
longer
his
and
understood
this
not
merely
from
the
attitude
the
court
saw
the
one
hand
that
the
military
business
which
had
played
his
part
was
ended
and
felt
that
his
mission
was
accomplished
and
the
same
time
began
conscious
the
physical
weariness
his
aged
body
and
the
necessity
physical
rest
the
twenty
ninth
november
kutuzov
entered
vilna
his
dear
vilna
called
twice
during
his
career
kutuzov
had
been
governor
vilna
that
wealthy
town
which
had
not
been
injured
found
old
friends
and
associations
besides
the
comforts
life
which
had
long
been
deprived
and
suddenly
turned
from
the
cares
army
and
state
and
far
the
passions
that
seethed
around
him
allowed
immersed
himself
the
quiet
life
which
had
formerly
been
accustomed
all
that
was
taking
place
and
all
that
had
still
done
the
realm
history
did
not
concern
him
all
chichagov
one
the
most
zealous
cutters
off
and
breakers
who
had
first
wanted
effect
diversion
greece
and
then
warsaw
but
never
wished
where
was
sent
chichagov
noted
for
the
boldness
with
which
spoke
the
emperor
and
who
considered
kutuzov
under
obligation
him
because
when
was
sent
make
peace
with
turkey
independently
kutuzov
and
found
that
peace
had
already
been
concluded
admitted
the
emperor
that
the
merit
securing
that
peace
was
really
kutuzov
this
chichagov
was
the
first
meet
kutuzov
the
castle
where
the
latter
was
stay
undress
naval
uniform
with
dirk
and
holding
his
cap
under
his
arm
handed
kutuzov
garrison
report
and
the
keys
the
town
the
contemptuously
respectful
attitude
the
younger
men
the
old
man
his
dotage
was
expressed
the
highest
degree
the
behavior
chichagov
who
knew
the
accusations
that
were
being
directed
against
kutuzov
when
speaking
chichagov
kutuzov
incidentally
mentioned
that
the
vehicles
packed
with
china
that
had
been
captured
from
him
borisov
had
been
recovered
and
would
restored
him
you
mean
imply
that
have
nothing
eat
out
the
contrary
can
supply
you
with
everything
even
you
want
give
dinner
parties
warmly
replied
chichagov
who
tried
every
word
spoke
prove
his
own
rectitude
and
therefore
imagined
kutuzov
animated
the
same
desire
kutuzov
shrugging
his
shoulders
replied
with
his
subtle
penetrating
smile
meant
merely
say
what
said
contrary
the
emperor
wish
kutuzov
detained
the
greater
part
the
army
vilna
those
about
him
said
that
became
extraordinarily
slack
and
physically
feeble
during
his
stay
that
town
attended
army
affairs
reluctantly
left
everything
his
generals
and
while
awaiting
the
emperor
arrival
led
dissipated
life
having
left
petersburg
the
seventh
december
with
his
suite
count
tolstoy
prince
volkonski
arakcheev
and
others
the
emperor
reached
vilna
the
eleventh
and
his
traveling
sleigh
drove
straight
the
castle

the
severe
frost
some
hundred

and

galloped

shouted
coming
and
konovnitsyn
rushed
into
the
vestibule
inform
kutuzov
who
was
waiting
the

minute
later
the
old
man
large
stout
figure
full
dress
uniform
his
chest
covered
with
orders
and
scarf
drawn
round
his
stomach
waddled
out
into
the
porch
put
his
hat
with
its
peaks
the
sides
and
holding
his
gloves
his
hand
and
walking
with
effort
sideways
down
the
steps
the
level
the
street
took
his
hand
the
report
had
prepared
for
the
emperor
there
was
running
and
fro
and
whispering
another
troyka
flew
furiously
and
then
all
eyes
were
turned
approaching
sleigh
which
the
figures
the
emperor
and
volkonski
could
already
descried
from
the
habit
fifty
years
all
this
had
physically
agitating
effect
the
old
general
carefully
and
hastily
felt
himself
all
over
readjusted
his
hat
and
pulling
himself
together
drew
himself
and
the
very
moment
when
the
emperor
having
alighted
from
the
sleigh
lifted
his
eyes
him
handed
him
the
report
and
began
speaking
his
smooth
ingratiating
voice
the
emperor
with
rapid
glance
scanned
kutuzov
from
head
foot
frowned
for
instant
but
immediately
mastering
himself
went
the
old
man
extended
his
arms
and
embraced
him
and
this
embrace
too
owing
long
standing
impression
related
his
innermost
feelings
had
its
usual
effect
kutuzov
and
gave
sob
the
emperor
greeted
the
officers
and
the
semenov
guard
and
again
pressing
the
old
man
hand
went
with
him
into
the
castle
when
alone
with
the
field
marshal
the
emperor
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
the
slowness
the
pursuit
and
the
mistakes
made
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
and
informed
him
his
intentions
for
future
campaign
abroad
kutuzov
made
rejoinder
remark
the
same
submissive
expressionless
look
with
which
had
listened
the
emperor
commands
the
field
austerlitz
seven
years
before
settled
his
face
now
when
kutuzov
came
out
the
study
and
with
lowered
head
was
crossing
the
ballroom
with
his
heavy
waddling
gait
was
arrested
someone
voice
saying
your
serene
highness
kutuzov
raised
his
head
and
looked
for
long
while
into
the
eyes
count
tolstoy
who
stood
before
him
holding
silver
salver
which
lay
small
object
kutuzov
seemed
not
understand
what
was
expected
him
suddenly
seemed
remember
scarcely
perceptible
smile
flashed
across
his
puffy
face
and
bowing
low
and
respectfully
took
the
object
that
lay
the
salver
was
the
order
george
the
first
class
chapter
next
day
the
field
marshal
gave
dinner
and
ball
which
the
emperor
honored
his
presence
kutuzov
had
received
the
order
george
the
first
class
and
the
emperor
showed
him
the
highest
honors
but
everyone
knew
the
imperial
dissatisfaction
with
him
the
proprieties
were
observed
and
the
emperor
was
the
first
set
that
example
but
everybody
understood
that
the
old
man
was
blameworthy
and
good
for
nothing
when
kutuzov
conforming
custom
catherine
day
ordered
the
standards
that
had
been
captured
lowered
the
emperor
feet
his
entering
the
ballroom
the
emperor
made
wry
face
and
muttered
something
which
some
people
caught
the
words
the
old
comedian
the
emperor
displeasure
with
kutuzov
was
specially
increased
vilna
the
fact
that
kutuzov
evidently
could
not
would
not
understand
the
importance
the
coming
campaign
when
the
following
morning
the
emperor
said
the
officers
assembled
about
him
you
have
not
only
saved
russia
you
have
saved
europe
they
all
understood
that
the
war
was
not
ended
kutuzov
alone
would
not
see
this
and
openly
expressed
his
opinion
that
fresh
war
could
improve
the
position
add
the
glory
russia
but
could
only
spoil
and
lower
the
glorious
position
that
russia
had
gained
tried
prove
the
emperor
the
impossibility
levying
fresh
troops
spoke
the
hardships
already
endured
the
people
the

unpleasant
encounters
with

the
natural
method
was
what
had
been
done
with
him

and
with

beginning
the
russian

transfer

thus
cutting
the
ground
from
under
the
commander

feet
without
upsetting
the
old
man
informing
him
the
change
with
this

was
gradually
reconstructed
and
its
real
strength
removed
and
transferred

spoke
loudly
the

had
bad
for
his

taken
away
and
given

all
that

from

the
curiosity
officers

also
remembered
his

above
all
remembered
his
incapacity

just
then

get
away
quickly

from

where

were
killing

some
peaceful
refuge
where

recover

after
his
illness
saw
attendance
him
two
his
servants
terenty
and
vaska
who
had
come
from
moscow
and
also
his
cousin
the
eldest
princess
who
had
been
living
his
estate
elets
and
hearing
his
rescue
and
illness
had
come
look
after
him
was
only
gradually
during
his
convalescence
that
pierre
lost
the
impressions
had
become
accustomed
during
the
last
few
months
and
got
used
the
idea
that
one
would
oblige
him
anywhere
tomorrow
that
one
would
deprive
him
his
warm
bed
and
that
would
sure
get
his
dinner
tea
and
supper
but
for
long
time
his
dreams
still
saw
himself
the
conditions
captivity
the
same
way
little
little
came
understand
the
news
had
been
told
after
his
rescue
about
the
death
prince
andrew
the
death
his
wife
and
the
destruction
the
french
joyous
feeling
freedom
that
complete
inalienable
freedom
natural
man
which
had
first
experienced
the
first
halt
outside
moscow
filled
pierre
soul
during
his
convalescence
was
surprised
find
that
this
inner
freedom
which
was
independent
external
conditions
now
had
were
additional
setting
external
liberty
was
alone
strange
town
without
acquaintances
one
demanded
anything
him
sent
him
anywhere
had
all
wanted
the
thought
his
wife
which
had
been
continual
torment
him
was
longer
there
since
she
was
more
how
good
how
splendid
said
himself
when
cleanly
laid
table
was
moved
him
with
savory
beef
tea
when
lay
down
for
the
night
soft
clean
bed
when
remembered
that
the
french
had
gone
and
that
his
wife
was
more
how
good
how
splendid
and
old
habit
asked
himself
the
question
well
and
what
then
what
going
and
immediately
gave
himself
the
answer
well
shall
live
how
splendid
the
very
question
that
had
formerly
tormented
him
the
thing
had
continually
sought
find
the
aim
life
longer
existed
for
him
now
that
search
for
the
aim
life
had
not
merely
disappeared
temporarily
felt
that
longer
existed
for
him
and
could
not
present
itself
again
and
this
very
absence
aim
gave
him
the
complete
joyous
sense
freedom
which
constituted
his
happiness
this
time
could
not
see
aim
for
now
had
faith
not
faith
any
kind
rule
words
ideas
but
faith
ever
living
ever
manifest
god
formerly
had
sought
him
aims
set
himself
that
search
for
aim
had
been
simply
search
for
god
and
suddenly
his
captivity
had
learned
not
words
reasoning
but
direct
feeling
what
his
nurse
had
told
him
long
ago
that
god
here
and
everywhere
his
captivity
had
learned
that
karataev
god
was
greater
more
infinite
and
unfathomable
than
the
architect
the
universe
recognized
the
freemasons
felt
like
man
who
after
straining
his
eyes
see
into
the
far
distance
finds
what
sought
his
very
feet
all
his
life
had
looked
over
the
heads
the
men
around
him
when
should
have
merely
looked
front
him
without
straining
his
eyes
the
past
had
never
been
able
find
that
great
inscrutable
infinite
something
had
only
felt
that
must
exist
somewhere
and
had
looked
for
everything
near
and
comprehensible
had
only
what
was
limited
petty
commonplace
and
senseless
had
equipped
himself
with
mental
telescope
and
looked
into
remote
space
where
petty
worldliness
hiding
itself
misty
distance
had
seemed
him
great
and
infinite
merely
because
was
not
clearly
seen
and
such
had
european
life
politics
freemasonry
philosophy
and
philanthropy
seemed
him
but
even
then
moments
weakness
had
accounted
them
his
mind
had
penetrated
those
distances
and
had
there
seen
the
same
pettiness
worldliness
and
senselessness
now
however
had
learned
see
the
great
eternal
and
infinite
everything
and
therefore
see
and
enjoy
its
contemplation
naturally
threw
away
the
telescope
through
which
had
till
now
gazed
over
men
heads
and
gladly
regarded
the
ever
changing
eternally
great
unfathomable
and
infinite
life
around
him
and
the
closer
looked
the
more
tranquil
and
happy
became
that
dreadful
question
what
for
which
had
formerly
destroyed
all
his
mental
edifices
longer
existed
for
him
that
question
what
for
simple
answer
was
now
always
ready
his
soul
because
there
god
that
god
without
whose
will
not
one
hair
falls
from

external
ways
pierre
had
hardly
changed
all
appearance
was
just
what
used
before
was
absent
minded
and
seemed
occupied
not
with
what
was
before
his
eyes
but
with
something
special
his
own
the
difference
between
his
former
and
present
self
was
that
formerly
when
did
not
grasp
what
lay
before
him
was
said
him
had
puckered
his
forehead
painfully
vainly
seeking
distinguish
something
distance
present
still
forgot
what
was
said
him
and
still
did
not
see
what
was
before
his
eyes
but
now
looked
with
scarcely
perceptible
and
seemingly
ironic
smile
what
was
before
him
and
listened
what
was
said
though
evidently
seeing
and
hearing
something
quite
different
formerly
had
appeared
kindhearted
but
unhappy
man
and
people
had
been
inclined
avoid
him
now
smile
the
joy
life
always
played
round
his
lips
and
sympathy
for
others
shone
his
eyes
with
questioning
look
whether
they
were
contented
was
and
people
felt
pleased
his
presence
previously
had
talked
great
deal
grew
excited
when
talked
and
seldom
listened
now
was
seldom
carried
away
conversation
and
knew
how
listen
that
people
readily
told
him
their
most
intimate
secrets
the
princess
who
had
never
liked
pierre
and
had
been
particularly
hostile
him
since
she
had
felt
herself
under
obligations
him
after
the
old
count
death
now
after
staying
short
time
orel
where
she
had
come
intending
show
pierre
that
spite
his
ingratitude
she
considered
her
duty
nurse
him
felt
her
surprise
and
vexation
that
she
had
become
fond
him
pierre
did
not
any
way
seek
her
approval
merely
studied
her
with
interest
formerly
she
had
felt
that
regarded
her
with
indifference
and
irony
and
had
shrunk
into
herself
she
did
with
others
and
had
shown
him
only
the
combative
side
her
nature
but
now
seemed
trying
understand
the
most
intimate
places
her
heart
and
mistrustfully
first
but
afterwards
gratefully
she
let
him
see
the
hidden
kindly
sides
her
character
the
most
cunning
man
could
not
have
crept
into
her
confidence
more
successfully
evoking
memories
the
best
times
her
youth
and
showing
sympathy
with
them
yet
pierre
cunning
consisted
simply
finding
pleasure
drawing
out
the
human
qualities
the
embittered
hard
and
her
own
way
proud
princess
yes
very
very
kind
man
when
not
under
the
influence
bad
people
but
people
such
myself
thought
she
his
servants
too
terenty
and
vaska
their
own
way
noticed
the
change
that
had
taken
place
pierre
they
considered
that
had
become
much
simpler
terenty
when
had
helped
him
undress
and
wished
him
good
night
often
lingered
with
his
master
boots
his
hands
and
clothes
over
his
arm
see
whether
would
not
start
talk
and
pierre
noticing
that
terenty
wanted
chat
generally
kept
him
there
well
tell
now
how
did
you
get
food
would
ask
and
terenty
would
begin
talking
the
destruction
moscow
and
the
old
count
and
would
stand
for
long
time
holding
the
clothes
and
talking
sometimes
listening
pierre
stories
and
then
would
out
into
the
hall
with
pleasant
sense
intimacy
with
his
master
and
affection
for
him
the
doctor
who
attended
pierre
and
visited
him
every
day
though
considered
his
duty
doctor
pose
man
whose
every
moment
was
value
suffering
humanity
would
sit
for
hours
with
pierre
telling
him
his
favorite
anecdotes
and
his
observations
the
characters
his
patients
general
and
especially
the
ladies
pleasure
talk
man
like
that
not
like
our
provincials
would
say
there
were
several
prisoners
from
the
french
army
orel
and
the
doctor
brought
one
them
young
italian
see
pierre
this
officer
began
visiting
pierre
and
the
princess
used
make
fun
the
tenderness
the
italian
expressed
for
him
the
italian
seemed
happy
only
when
could
come
see
pierre
talk
with
him
tell
him
about
his
past
his
life
home
and
his
love
and
pour
out
him
his
indignation
against
the
french
and
especially
against
napoleon
all
russians
are
the
least
like
you
sacrilege
fight
such
nation
said
pierre
you
who
have
suffered
from
the
french
not
even
feel
animosity
toward
them
pierre
had
evoked
the
passionate
affection
the
italian
merely
evoking
the
best
side
his
nature
and
taking
pleasure
doing
during
the
last
days
pierre
stay
orel
his
old
masonic
acquaintance
count
willarski
who
had
introduced
him
the
lodge
came
see
him
willarski
was
married
russian
heiress
who
had
large
estate
orel
province
and
occupied
temporary
post
the
commissariat
department
that
town
hearing
that
bezukhov
was
orel
willarski
though
they
had
never
been
intimate
came
him
with
the
professions
friendship
and
intimacy
that
people
who
meet
desert
generally
express
for
one
another
willarski
felt
dull
orel
and
was
pleased
meet
man
his
own
circle
and
supposed
similar
interests
but
his
surprise
willarski
soon
noticed
that
pierre
had
lagged
much
behind
the
times
and
had
sunk
expressed
himself
into
apathy
and
egotism
you
are
letting
yourself
dear
fellow
said
but
for
all
that
willarski
found
pleasanter
now
than
had
been
formerly
with
pierre
and
came
see
him
every
day
pierre
looked
and
listened
willarski
seemed
strange
think
that
had
been
like
that
himself
but
short
time
before
willarski
was
married
man
with
family
busy
with
his
family
affairs
his
wife
affairs
and
his
official
duties
regarded
all
these
occupations
hindrances
life
and
considered
that
they
were
all
contemptible
because
their
aim
was
the
welfare
himself
and
his
family
military
administrative
political
and
masonic
interests
continually
absorbed
his
attention
and
pierre
without
trying
change
the
other
views
and
without
condemning
him
but
with
the
quiet
joyful
and
amused
smile
now
habitual
him
was
interested
this
strange
though
very
familiar
phenomenon
there
was
new
feature
pierre
relations
with
willarski
with
the
princess
with
the
doctor
and
with
all
the
people
now
met
which
gained
for
him
the
general
good
will
this
was
his
acknowledgment
the
impossibility
changing
man
convictions
words
and
his
recognition
the
possibility
everyone
thinking
feeling
and
seeing
things
each
from
his
own
point
view
this
legitimate
peculiarity
each
individual
which
used
excite
and
irritate
pierre
now
became
basis
the
sympathy
felt
for
and
the
interest
took
other
people
the
difference
and
sometimes
complete
contradiction
between
men
opinions
and
their
lives
and
between
one
man
and
another
pleased
him
and
drew
from
him
amused
and
gentle
smile
practical
matters
pierre
unexpectedly
felt
within
himself
center
gravity
had
previously
lacked
formerly
all
pecuniary
questions
especially
requests
for
money
which
extremely
wealthy
man
was
very
exposed
produced
him
state
hopeless
agitation
and
perplexity
give
not
give
had
asked
himself
have
and
needs
but
someone
else
needs
still
more
who
needs
most
and
perhaps
they
are
both
impostors
the
old
days
had
been
unable
find
way
out
all
these
surmises
and
had
given
all
who
asked
long
had
anything
give
formerly
had
been
similar
state
perplexity
with
regard
every
question
concerning
his
property
when
one
person
advised
one
thing
and
another
something
else
now
his
surprise
found
that
longer
felt
either
doubt
perplexity
about
these
questions
there
was
now
within
him
judge
who
some
rule
unknown
him
decided
what
should
should
not
done
was
indifferent
heretofore
money
matters
but
now
felt
certain
what
ought
and
what
ought
not
done
the
first
time
had
recourse
his
new
judge
was
when
french
prisoner
colonel
came
him
and
after
talking
great
deal
about
his
exploits
concluded
making
what
amounted
demand
that
pierre
should
give
him
four
thousand
francs
send
his
wife
and
children
pierre
refused
without
the
least
difficulty
effort
and
was
afterwards
surprised
how
simple
and
easy
had
been
what
used
appear
insurmountably
difficult
the
same
time
that
refused
the
colonel
demand
made
his
mind
that
must
have
recourse
artifice
when
leaving
orel
induce
the
italian
officer
accept
some
money
which
was
evidently
need
further
proof
pierre
his
own
more
settled
outlook
practical
matters
was
furnished
his
decision
with
regard
his
wife
debts
and
the
rebuilding
his
houses
and
near
moscow
his
head
steward
came
him
orel
and
pierre
reckoned
with
him
his
diminished
income
the
burning
moscow
had
cost
him
according
the
head
steward
calculation
about
two
million
rubles
console
pierre
for
these
losses
the
head
steward
gave
him
estimate
showing
that
despite
these
losses
his
income
would
not
diminished
but
would
even
increased
refused
pay
his
wife
debts
which
was
under
obligation
meet
and
did
not
rebuild
his
moscow
house
and
the
country
house
his
moscow
estate
which
had
cost
him
eighty
thousand
rubles
year
and
brought
nothing
yes
course
that
true
said
pierre
with
cheerful
smile
don
need
all
that
all
being
ruined
have
become
much
richer
but
january
savelich
came
from
moscow
and
gave
him
account
the
state
things
there
and
spoke
the
estimate
architect
had
made
the
cost
rebuilding
the
town
and
country
houses
speaking
this
settled
matter
about
the
same
time
received
letters
from
prince
vasili
and
other
petersburg
acquaintances
speaking
his
wife
debts
and
pierre
decided
that
the
steward
proposals
which
had
pleased
him
were
wrong
and
that
must
petersburg
and
settle
his
wife
affairs
and
must
rebuild
moscow
why
this
was
necessary
did
not
know
but
knew
for
certain
that
was
necessary
his
income
would
reduced
three
fourths
but
felt
must
done
willarski
was
going
moscow
and
they
agreed
travel
together
during
the
whole
time
his
convalescence
orel
pierre
had
experienced
feeling
joy
freedom
and
life
but
when
during
his
journey
found
himself
the
open
world
and
saw
hundreds
new
faces
that
feeling
was
intensified
throughout
his
journey
felt
like
schoolboy
holiday
everyone
the
stagecoach
driver
the
post
house
overseers
the
peasants
the
roads
and
the
villages
had
new
significance
for
him
the
presence
and
remarks
willarski
who
continually
deplored
the
ignorance
and
poverty
russia
and
its
backwardness
compared
with
europe
only
heightened
pierre
pleasure
where
willarski
saw
deadness
pierre
saw
extraordinary
strength
and
vitality
the
strength
which
that
vast
space
amid
the
snows
maintained
the
life
this
original
peculiar
and
unique
people
did
not
contradict
willarski
and
even
seemed
agree
with
him
apparent
agreement
being
the
simplest
way
avoid
discussions
that
could
lead
nothing
and
smiled
joyfully
listened
him
chapter

would
difficult
explain
why
and
whither
ants
whose
heap
has
been
destroyed
are
hurrying
some
from
the
heap
dragging
bits
rubbish
larvae
and
corpses
others
back
the
heap
why
they
jostle
overtake

another
and
fight
and
would
equally
difficult
explain
what
caused
the
russians
after
the
departure
the
french
throng
the
place
that
had
formerly
been
moscow
but
when
watch
the
ants
round
their
ruined
heap
the
tenacity
energy
and
immense
number
the
delving
insects
prove
that
despite
the
destruction
the
heap
something
indestructible
which
though
intangible
the
real
strength
the
colony
still
exists
and
similarly
though
moscow
the
month
october
there
was
government
and
churches
shrines
riches
houses
was
still
the
moscow
had
been
august
all
was
destroyed
except
something
intangible
yet
powerful
and
indestructible
the
motives
those
who
thronged
from
all
sides
moscow
after
had
been
cleared
the
enemy
were
most
diverse
and
personal
and
first
for
the
most
part
savage
and
brutal
one
motive
only
they
all
had
common
desire
get
the
place
that
had
been
called
moscow
apply
their
activities
there
within
week
moscow
already
had
fifteen
thousand
inhabitants
fortnight
twenty
five
thousand
and
the
autumn
the
number
ever
increasing
and
increasing
exceeded
what
had
been
the
first
russians
enter
moscow
were
the
cossacks
wintzingerode
detachment
peasants
from
the
adjacent
villages
and
residents
who
had
fled
from
moscow
and
had
been
hiding
its
vicinity
the
russians
who
entered
moscow
finding
plundered
plundered
their
turn
they
continued
what
the
french
had
begun
trains
peasant
carts
came
moscow
carry
off
the
villages
what
had
been
abandoned
the
ruined
houses
and
the
streets
the
cossacks
carried
off
what
they
could
their
camps
and
the
householders
seized
all
they
could
find
other
houses
and
moved
their
own
pretending
that
was
their
property
but
the
first
plunderers
were
followed
second
and
third
contingent
and
with
increasing
numbers
plundering
became
more
and
more
difficult
and
assumed
more
definite
forms
the
french
found
moscow
abandoned
but
with
all
the
organizations
regular
life
with
diverse
branches
commerce
and
craftsmanship
with
luxury
and
governmental
and
religious
institutions
these
forms
were
lifeless
but
still
existed
there
were
bazaars
shops
warehouses
market
stalls
granaries
for
the
most
part
still
stocked
with
goods
and

called

and
some
acquaintances
who
were
back
moscow
and
intended
leave
for
petersburg
two
days
later
everybody
was
celebrating
the
victory
everything
was
bubbling
with
life
the
ruined
but
reviving
city
everyone
was
pleased
see
pierre
everyone
wished
meet
him
and
everyone
questioned
him
about
what
had
seen
pierre
felt
particularly
well
disposed
toward
them
all
but
was
now
instinctively
his
guard
for
fear
binding
himself
any
way
all
questions
put
him
whether
important
quite
trifling
such
where
would
live
was
going
rebuild
when
was
going
petersburg
and
would
mind
taking
parcel
for
someone
replied
yes
perhaps
think
and
had
heard
that
the
rostovs
were
kostroma
but
the
thought
natasha
seldom
occurred
him
did
was
only
pleasant
memory
the
distant
past
felt
himself
not
only
free
from
social
obligations
but
also
from
that
feeling
which
seemed
him
had
aroused
himself
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
heard
from
the
drubetskoys
that
princess
mary
was
moscow
the
death
sufferings
and
last
days
prince
andrew
had
often
occupied
pierre
thoughts
and
now
recurred
him
with
fresh
vividness
having
heard
dinner
that
princess
mary
was
moscow
and
living
her
house
which
had
not
been
burned
vozdvizhenka
street
drove
that
same
evening
see
her
his
way
the
house
pierre
kept
thinking
prince
andrew
their
friendship
his
various
meetings
with
him
and
especially
the
last
one
borodino
possible
that
died
the
bitter
frame
mind
was
then
possible
that
the
meaning
life
was
not
disclosed
him
before
died
thought
pierre
recalled
karataev
and
his
death
and
involuntarily
began
compare
these
two
men
different
and
yet
similar
that
they
had
both
lived
and
both
died
and
the
love
felt
for
both
them
pierre
drove
the
house
the
old
prince
most
serious
mood
the
house
had
escaped
the
fire
showed
signs
damage
but
its
general
aspect
was
unchanged
the
old
footman
who
met
pierre
with
stern
face
wishing
make
the
visitor
feel
that
the
absence
the
old
prince
had
not
disturbed
the
order
things
the
house
informed
him
that
the
princess
had
gone
her
own
apartments
and
that
she
received
sundays
announce
perhaps
she
will
see
said
pierre
yes
sir
said
the
man
please
step
into
the
portrait
gallery
few
minutes
later
the
footman
returned
with
dessalles
who
brought
word
from
the
princess
that
she
would
very
glad
see
pierre
would
excuse
her
want
ceremony
and
come
upstairs
her
apartment
rather
low
room
lit
one
candle
sat
the
princess
and
with
her
another
person
dressed
black
pierre
remembered
that
the
princess
always
had
lady
companions
but
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
like
never
knew
remembered
this
must
one
her
companions
thought
glancing
the
lady
the
black
dress
the
princess
rose
quickly
meet
him
and
held
out
her
hand
yes
she
said
looking
his
altered
face
after
had
kissed
her
hand
this
how
meet
again
spoke
you
even
the
very
last
she
went
turning
her
eyes
from
pierre
her
companion
with
shyness
that
surprised
him
for
instant
was
glad
hear
your
safety
was
the
first
piece
good
news
had
received
for
long
time
again
the
princess
glanced
round
her
companion
with
even
more
uneasiness
her
manner
and
was
about
add
something
but
pierre
interrupted
her
just
imagine
knew
nothing
about
him
said
thought
had
been
killed
all
know
heard
second
hand
from
others
only
know
that
fell
with
the
rostovs
what
strange
coincidence
pierre
spoke
rapidly
and
with
animation
glanced
once
the
companion
face
saw
her
attentive
and
kindly
gaze
fixed
him
and
often
happens
when
one
talking
felt
somehow
that
this
companion
the
black
dress
was
good
kind
excellent
creature
who
would
not
hinder
his
conversing
freely
with
princess
mary
but
when
mentioned
the
rostovs
princess
mary
face
expressed
still
greater
embarrassment
she
again
glanced
rapidly
from
pierre
face
that
the
lady
the
black
dress
and
said
you
really
not
recognize
her
pierre
looked
again
the
companion
pale
delicate
face
with
its
black
eyes
and
peculiar
mouth
and
something
near
him
long
forgotten
and
more
than
sweet
looked
him
from
those
attentive
eyes
but
can
thought
this
stern
thin
pale
face
that
looks
much
older
cannot
she
merely
reminds
her
but
that
moment
princess
mary
said
natasha
and
with
difficulty
effort
and
stress
like
the
opening
door
grown
rusty
its
hinges
smile
appeared
the
face
with
the
attentive
eyes
and
from
that
opening
door
came
breath
fragrance
which
suffused
pierre
with
happiness
had
long
forgotten
and
which
had
not
even
been
thinking
especially
that
moment
suffused
him
seized
him
and
enveloped
him
completely
when
she
smiled
doubt
was
longer
possible
was
natasha
and
loved
her
that
moment
pierre
involuntarily
betrayed
her
princess
mary
and
above
all
himself
secret
which
himself
had
been
unaware
flushed
joyfully
yet
with
painful
distress
tried
hide
his
agitation
but
the
more
tried
hide
the
more
clearly
clearer
than
any
words
could
have
done
did
betray
himself
her
and
princess
mary
that
loved
her
only
the
unexpectedness
thought
pierre
but
soon
tried
continue
the
conversation
had
begun
with
princess
mary
again
glanced
natasha
and
still
deeper
flush
suffused
his
face
and
still
stronger
agitation
mingled
joy
and
fear
seized
his
soul
became
confused
his
speech
and
stopped
the
middle
what
was
saying
pierre
had
failed
notice
natasha
because
did
not
all
expect
see
her
there
but
had
failed
recognize
her
because
the
change
her
since
last
saw
her
was
immense
she
had
grown
thin
and
pale
but
that
was
not
what
made
her
unrecognizable
she
was
unrecognizable
the
moment
entered
because
that
face
whose
eyes
had
always
shone
with
suppressed
smile
the
joy
life
now
when
first
entered
and
glanced
her
there
was
not
the
least
shadow
smile
only
her
eyes
were
kindly
attentive
and
sadly
interrogative
pierre
confusion
was
not
reflected
any
confusion
natasha
part
but
only
the
pleasure
that
just
perceptibly
lit
her
whole
face
chapter
xvi
she
has
come
stay
with
said
princess
mary
the
count
and
countess
will
here
few
days
the
countess
dreadful
state
but
was
necessary
for
natasha
herself
see
doctor
they
insisted
her
coming
with
yes
there
family
free
from
sorrow
now
said
pierre
addressing
natasha
you
know
happened
the
very
day
were
rescued
saw
him
what
delightful
boy
was
natasha
looked
him
and
way
answer
his
words
her
eyes
widened
and
lit
what
can
one
say
think
consolation
said
pierre
nothing
why
had
such
splendid
boy
full
life
die
yes
these
days
would
hard
live
without
faith
remarked
princess
mary
yes
yes
that
really
true
pierre
hastily
interrupted
her
why
true
natasha
asked
looking
attentively
into
pierre
eyes
how
can
you
ask
why
said
princess
mary
the
thought
alone
what
awaits
natasha
without
waiting
for
princess
mary
finish
again
looked
inquiringly
pierre
and
because
pierre
continued
only
one
who
believes
that
there
god
ruling
can
bear
loss
such
hers
and
yours
natasha
had
already
opened
her
mouth
speak
but
suddenly
stopped
pierre
hurriedly
turned
away
from
her
and
again
addressed
princess
mary
asking
about
his
friend
last
days
pierre
confusion
had
now
almost
vanished
but
the
same
time
felt
that
his
freedom
had
also
completely
gone
felt
that
there
was
now
judge
his
every
word
and
action
whose
judgment
mattered
more
him
than
that
all
the
rest
the
world
spoke
now
was
considering
what
impression
his
words
would
make
natasha
did
not
purposely
say
things
please
her
but
whatever
was
saying
regarded
from
her
standpoint
princess
mary
reluctantly
usual
such
cases
began
telling
the
condition
which
she
had
found
prince
andrew
but
pierre
face
quivering
with
emotion
his
questions
and
his
eager
restless
expression
gradually
compelled
her
into
details
which
she
feared
recall
for
her
own
sake
yes
yes
and
pierre
kept
saying
leaned
toward
her
with
his
whole
body
and
eagerly
listened
her
story
yes
yes
grew
tranquil
and
softened
with
all
his
soul
had
always
sought
one
thing
perfectly
good
could
not
afraid
death
the
faults
had
had
any
were
not
his
making
did
soften
what
happy
thing
that
saw
you
again
added
suddenly
turning
natasha
and
looking
her
with
eyes
full
tears
natasha
face
twitched
she
frowned
and
lowered
her
eyes
for
moment
she
hesitated
for
instant
whether
speak
not
yes
that
was
happiness
she
then
said
her
quiet
voice
with
its
deep
chest
notes
for
certainly
was
happiness
she
paused
and
said
was
wishing
for
the
very
moment
entered
the
room
natasha
voice
broke
she
blushed
pressed
her
clasped
hands
her
knees
and
then
controlling
herself
with
evident
effort
lifted
her
head
and
began
speak
rapidly
knew
nothing
when
started
from
moscow
did
not
dare
ask
about
him
then
suddenly
sonya
told
was
traveling
with
had
idea
and
could
not
imagine
what
state
was
all
wanted
was
see
him
and
with
him
she
said
trembling
and
breathing
quickly
and
not
letting
them
interrupt
her
she
went
tell
what
she
had
never
yet
mentioned
anyone
all
she
had
lived
through
during
those
three
weeks
their
journey
and
life
yaroslavl
pierre
listened
her
with
lips
parted
and
eyes
fixed
upon
her
full
tears
listened
did
not
think
prince
andrew
nor
death
nor
what
she
was
telling
listened
her
and
felt
only
pity
for
her
for
what
she
was
suffering
now
while
she
was
speaking
princess
mary
frowning
her
effort
hold
back
her
tears
sat
beside
natasha
and
heard
for
the
first
time
the
story
those
last
days
her
brother
and
natasha
love
evidently
natasha
needed
tell
that
painful
yet
joyful
tale
she
spoke
mingling
most
trifling
details
with
the
intimate
secrets
her
soul
and
seemed
she
could
never
finish
several
times
she
repeated
the
same
thing
twice
dessalles
voice
was
heard
outside
the
door
asking
whether
little
nicholas
might
come
say
good
night
well
that
all
everything
said
natasha
she
got
quickly
just
nicholas
entered
almost
ran
the
door
which
was
hidden
curtains
struck
her
head
against
and
rushed
from
the
room
with
moan
either
pain
sorrow
pierre
gazed
the
door
through
which
she
had
disappeared
and
did
not
understand
why
suddenly
felt
all
alone
the
world
princess
mary
roused
him
from
his
abstraction
drawing
his
attention
her
nephew
who
had
entered
the
room
that
moment
emotional
tenderness
young
nicholas
face
which
resembled
his
father
affected
pierre
much
that
when
had
kissed
the
boy
got
quickly
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
went
the
window
wished
take
leave
princess
mary
but
she
would
not
let
him
natasha
and
sometimes
don
sleep
till
after
two
please
don
will
order
supper
downstairs
will
come
immediately
before
pierre
left
the
room
princess
mary
told
him
this
the
first
time
she
has
talked
him
like
that
chapter
xvii
pierre
was
shown
into
the
large
brightly
lit
dining
room
few
minutes
later
heard
footsteps
and
princess
mary
entered
with
natasha
natasha
was
calm
though
severe
and
grave
expression
had
again
settled
her
face
they
all
three
them
now
experienced
that
feeling
awkwardness
which
usually
follows
after
serious
and
heartfelt
talk
impossible
back
the
same
conversation
talk
trifles
awkward
and
yet
the
desire
speak
there
and
silence
seems
like
affectation
they
went
silently
table
the
footmen
drew
back
the
chairs
and
pushed
them
again
pierre
unfolded
his
cold
table
napkin
and
resolving
break
the
silence
looked
natasha
and
princess
mary
they
had
evidently
both
formed
the
same
resolution
the
eyes
both
shone
with
satisfaction
and
confession
that
besides
sorrow
life
also
has
joy
you
take
vodka
count
asked
princess
mary
and
those
words
suddenly
banished
the
shadows
the
past
now
tell
about
yourself
said
she
one
hears
such
improbable
wonders
about
you
yes
replied
pierre
with
the
smile
mild
irony
now
habitual
him
they
even
tell
wonders
myself
never
dreamed
mary
abramovna
invited
her
house
and
kept
telling
what
had
happened
ought
have
happened
stepan
stepanych
also
instructed
how
ought
tell
experiences
general
have
noticed
that
very
easy
interesting
man
interesting
man
now
people
invite
out
and
tell
all
about
myself
natasha
smiled
and
was
the
point
speaking
have
been
told
princess
mary
interrupted
her
that
you
lost
two
millions
moscow
that
true
but
three
times
rich
before
returned
pierre
though
the
position
was
now
altered
his
decision
pay
his
wife
debts
and
rebuild
his
houses
pierre
still
maintained
that
had
become
three
times
rich
before
what
have
certainly
gained
freedom
began
seriously
but
did
not
continue
noticing
that
this
theme
was
too
egotistic
and
are
you
building
yes
savelich
says
must
tell
you
did
not
know
the
countess
death
when
you
decided
remain
moscow
asked
princess
mary
and
immediately
blushed
noticing
that
her
question
following
his
mention
freedom
ascribed
his
words
meaning
had
perhaps
not
intended
answered
pierre
evidently
not
considering
awkward
the
meaning
princess
mary
had
given
his
words
heard
orel
and
you
cannot
imagine
how
shocked
were
not
exemplary
couple
added
quickly
glancing
natasha
and
noticing
her
face
curiosity
how
would
speak
his
wife
but
her
death
shocked
terribly
when
two
people
quarrel
they
are
always
both
fault
and
one
own
guilt
suddenly
becomes
terribly
serious
when
the
other
longer
alive
and
then
such
death
without
friends
and
without
consolation
very
very
sorry
for
her
concluded
and
was
pleased
notice
look
glad
approval
natasha
face
yes
and
you
are
once
more
eligible
bachelor
said
princess
mary
pierre
suddenly
flushed
crimson
and
for
long
time
tried
not
look
natasha
when
ventured
glance
her
way
again
her
face
was
cold
stern
and
fancied
even
contemptuous
and
did
you
really
see
and
speak
napoleon
have
been
told
said
princess
mary
pierre
laughed
not
once
everybody
seems
imagine
that
being
taken
prisoner
means
being
napoleon
guest
not
only
did
never
see
him
but
heard
nothing
about
him
was
much
lower
company
supper
was
over
and
pierre
who
first
declined
speak
about
his
captivity
was
gradually
led
but
true
that
you
remained
moscow
kill
napoleon
natasha
asked
with
slight
smile
guessed
then
when
met
the
sukharev
tower
you
remember
pierre
admitted
that
was
true
and
from
that
was
gradually
led
princess
mary
questions
and
especially
natasha
into
giving
detailed
account
his
adventures
first
spoke
with
the
amused
and
mild
irony
now
customary
with
him
toward
everybody
and
especially
toward
himself
but
when
came
describe
the
horrors
and
sufferings
had
witnessed
was
unconsciously
carried
away
and
began
speaking
with
the
suppressed
emotion
man
experiencing
recollection
strong
impressions
has
lived
through
princess
mary
with
gentle
smile
looked
now
pierre
and
now
natasha
the
whole
narrative
she
saw
only
pierre
and
his
goodness
natasha
leaning
her
elbow
the
expression
her
face
constantly
changing
with
the
narrative
watched
pierre
with
attention
that
never
wandered
evidently
herself
experiencing
all
that
described
not
only
her
look
but
her
exclamations
and
the
brief
questions
she
put
showed
pierre
that
she
understood
just
what
wished
convey
was
clear
that
she
understood
not
only
what
said
but
also
what
wished
but
could
not
express
words
the
account
pierre
gave
the
incident
with
the
child
and
the
woman
for
protecting
whom
was
arrested
was
this
was
awful
sight
children
abandoned
some
the
flames
one
was
snatched
out
before
eyes
and
there
were
women
who
had
their
things
snatched
off
and
their
earrings
torn
out
flushed
and
grew
confused
then
patrol
arrived
and
all
the
men
all
those
who
were
not
looting
that
were
arrested
and
among
them
sure
you
not
telling
everything
sure
you
did
something
said
natasha
and
pausing
added
something
fine
pierre
continued
when
spoke
the
execution
wanted
pass
over
the
horrible
details
but
natasha
insisted
that
should
not
omit
anything
pierre
began
tell
about
karataev
but
paused
this
time
had
risen
from
the
table
and
was
pacing
the
room
natasha
following
him
with
her
eyes
then
added
you
can
understand
what
learned
from
that
illiterate
man
that
simple
fellow
yes
yes
said
natasha
where
they
killed
him
almost
before
eyes
and
pierre
his
voice
trembling
continually
went
tell
the
last
days
their
retreat
karataev
illness
and
his
death
told
his
adventures
had
never
yet
recalled
them
now
were
saw
new
meaning
all
had
gone
through
now
that
was
telling
all
natasha
experienced
that
pleasure
which
man
has
when
women
listen
him
not
clever
women
who
when
listening
either
try
remember
what
they
hear
enrich
their
minds
and
when
opportunity
offers
retell
who
wish
adopt
some
thought
their
own
and
promptly
contribute
their
own
clever
comments
prepared
their
little
mental
workshop
but
the
pleasure
given
real
women
gifted
with
capacity
select
and
absorb
the
very
best
man
shows
himself
natasha
without
knowing
was
all
attention
she
did
not
lose
word
single
quiver
pierre
voice
look
twitch
muscle
his
face
nor
single
gesture
she
caught
the
unfinished
word
its
flight
and
took
straight
into
her
open
heart
divining
the
secret
meaning
all
pierre
mental
travail
princess
mary
understood
his
story
and
sympathized
with
him
but
she
now
saw
something
else
that
absorbed
all
her
attention
she
saw
the
possibility
love
and
happiness
between
natasha
and
pierre
and
the
first
thought
this
filled
her
heart
with
gladness
was
three
clock
the
morning
the
footmen
came
with
sad
and
stern
faces
change
the
candles
but
one
noticed
them
pierre
finished
his
story
natasha
continued
look
him
intently
with
bright
attentive
and
animated
eyes
trying
understand
something
more
which
had
perhaps
left
untold
pierre
shamefaced
and
happy
confusion
glanced
occasionally
her
and
tried
think
what
say
next
introduce
fresh
subject
princess
mary
was
silent
occurred
none
them
that
was
three
clock
and
time
bed
people
speak
misfortunes
and
sufferings
remarked
pierre
but
this
moment
were
asked
would
you
rather
what
you
were
before
you
were
taken
prisoner
through
all
this
again
then
for
heaven
sake
let
again
have
captivity
and
horseflesh
imagine
that
when
are
thrown
out
our
usual
ruts
all
lost
but
only
then
that
what
new
and
good
begins
while
there
life
there
happiness
there
much
much
before
say
this
you
added
turning
natasha
yes
yes
she
said
answering
something
quite
different
too
should
wish
nothing
but
relive
all
from
the
beginning
pierre
looked
intently
her
yes
and
nothing
more
said
natasha
not
true
not
true
cried
pierre
not
blame
for
being
alive
and
wishing
live
nor
you
either
suddenly
natasha
bent
her
head
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
began
cry
what
natasha
said
princess
mary
nothing
nothing
she
smiled
pierre
through
her
tears
good
night
time
for
bed
pierre
rose
and
took
his
leave
princess
mary
and
natasha
met
usual
the
bedroom
they
talked
what
pierre
had
told
them
princess
mary
did
not
express
her
opinion
pierre
nor
did
natasha
speak
him
well
good
night
mary
said
natasha
you
know
often
afraid
that
not
speaking
him
she
meant
prince
andrew
for
fear
not
doing
justice
our
feelings
forget
him
princess
mary
sighed
deeply
and
thereby
acknowledged
the
justice
natasha
remark
but
she
did
not
express
agreement
words
possible
forget
said
she
did
much
good
tell
all
about
today
was
hard
and
painful
but
good
very
good
said
natasha
sure
really
loved
him
that
why
told
him
was
all
right
she
added
suddenly
blushing
tell
pierre
yes
what
splendid
man
said
princess
mary
you
know
mary
natasha
suddenly
said
with
mischievous
smile
such
princess
mary
had
not
seen
her
face
for
long
time
has
somehow
grown
clean
smooth
and
fresh
had
just
come
out
russian
bath
you
understand
out
moral
bath
isn
true
yes
replied
princess
mary
has
greatly
improved
with
short
coat
and
his
hair
cropped
just
well
just
had
come
straight
from
the
bath
papa
used
understand
why
prince
andrew
liked
one
much
him
said
princess
mary
yes
and
yet
quite
different
they
say
men
are
friends
when
they
are
quite
different
that
must
true
really
quite
unlike
him
everything
yes
but
wonderful
well
good
night
said
natasha
and
the
same
mischievous
smile
lingered
for
long
time
her
face
had
been
forgotten
there
chapter
xviii
was
long
time
before
pierre
could
fall
asleep
that
night
paced
and
down
his
room
now
turning
his
thoughts
difficult
problem
and
frowning
now
suddenly
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
wincing
and
now
smiling
happily
was
thinking
prince
andrew
natasha
and
their
love
one
moment
jealous
her
past
then
reproaching
himself
for
that
feeling
was
already
six
the
morning
and
still
paced
and
down
the
room
well
what
done
cannot
avoided
what
done
evidently
has
said
himself
and
hastily
undressing
got
into
bed
happy
and
agitated
but
free
from
hesitation
indecision
strange
and
impossible
such
happiness
seems
must
everything
that
she
and
may
man
and
wife
told
himself
few
days
previously
pierre
had
decided
petersburg
the
friday
when
awoke
the
thursday
savelich
came
ask
him
about
packing
for
the
journey
what
petersburg
what
petersburg
who
there
petersburg
asked
involuntarily
though
only
himself
yes
long
ago
before
this
happened
did
for
some
reason
mean
petersburg
reflected
why
but
perhaps
shall
what
good
fellow
and
how
attentive
and
how
remembers
everything
thought
looking
savelich
old
face
and
what
pleasant
smile
has
well
savelich
you
still
not
wish
accept
your
freedom
pierre
asked
him
what
the
good
freedom
your
excellency
lived
under
the
late
count
the
kingdom
heaven
his
and
have
lived
under
you
too
without
ever
being
wronged
and
your
children
the
children
will
live
just
the
same
with
such
masters
one
can
live
but
what
about
heirs
said
pierre
supposing
suddenly
marry
might
happen
added
with
involuntary
smile
may
take
the
liberty
your
excellency
would
good
thing
how
easy
thinks
thought
pierre
doesn
know
how
terrible
and
how
dangerous
too
soon
too
late
terrible
what
are
your
orders
are
you
starting
tomorrow
asked
savelich
put
off
for
bit
tell
you
later
you
must
forgive
the
trouble
have
put
you
said
pierre
and
seeing
savelich
smile
thought
but
how
strange
that
should
not
know
that
now
there
petersburg
for
and
that
that
must
settled
first
all
but
probably
knows
well
enough
and
only
pretending
shall
have
talk
with
him
and
see
what
thinks
pierre
reflected
another
time
breakfast
pierre
told
the
princess
his
cousin
that
had
been
see
princess
mary
the
day
before
and
had
there
met
whom
you
think
natasha
rostova
the
princess
seemed
see
nothing
more
extraordinary
that
than
had
seen
anna
semenovna
you
know
her
asked
pierre
have
seen
the
princess
she
replied
heard
that
they
were
arranging
match
for
her
with
young
rostov
would
very
good
thing
for
the
rostovs
they
are
said
utterly
ruined
mean
you
know
natasha
rostova
heard
about
that
affair
hers
the
time
was
great
pity
she
either
doesn
understand
pretending
thought
pierre
better
not
say
anything
her
either
the
princess
too
had
prepared
provisions
for
pierre
journey
how
kind
they
all
are
thought
pierre
what
surprising
that
they
should
trouble
about
these
things
now
when
can
longer
interest
them
and
all
for
the
same
day
the
chief
police
came
pierre
inviting
him
send
representative
the
faceted
palace
recover
things
that
were
returned
their
owners
that
day
and
this
man
too
thought
pierre
looking
into
the
face
the
chief
police
what
fine
good
looking
officer
and
how
kind
fancy
bothering
about
such
trifles
now
and
they
actually
say
not
honest
and
takes
bribes
what
nonsense
besides
why
shouldn
take
bribes
that
the
way
was
brought
and
everybody
does
but
what
kind
pleasant
face
and
how
smiles
looks
pierre
went
princess
mary
dinner
drove
through
the
streets
past
the
houses
that
had
been
burned
down
was
surprised
the
beauty
those
ruins
the
picturesqueness
the
chimney
stacks
and
tumble
down
walls
the
burned
out
quarters
the
town
stretching
out
and
concealing
one
another
reminded
him
the
rhine
and
the
colosseum
the
cabmen
met
and
their
passengers
the
carpenters
cutting
the
timber
for
new
houses
with
axes
the
women
hawkers
and
the
shopkeepers
all
looked
him
with
cheerful
beaming
eyes
that
seemed
say
there
let
see
what
will
come
the
entrance
princess
mary
house
pierre
felt
doubtful
whether
had
really
been
there
the
night
before
and
really
seen
natasha
and
talked
her
perhaps
imagined
perhaps
shall
and
find
one
there
but
had
hardly
entered
the
room
before
felt
her
presence
with
his
whole
being
the
loss
his
sense
freedom
she
was
the
same
black
dress
with
soft
folds
and
her
hair
was
done
the
same
way
the
day
before
yet
she
was
quite
different
had
she
been
like
this
when
entered
the
day
before
could
not
for
moment
have
failed
recognize
her
she
was
had
known
her
almost
child
and
later
prince
andrew
fiancee
bright
questioning
light
shone
her
eyes
and
her
face
was
friendly
and
strangely
roguish
expression
pierre
dined
with
them
and
would
have
spent
the
whole
evening
there
but
princess
mary
was
going
vespers
and
pierre
left
the
house
with
her
next
day
came
early
dined
and
stayed
the
whole
evening
though
princess
mary
and
natasha
were
evidently
glad
see
their
visitor
and
though
all
pierre
interest
was
now
centered
that
house
the
evening
they
had
talked
over
everything
and
the
conversation
passed
from
one
trivial
topic
another
and
repeatedly
broke
off
stayed
long
that
princess
mary
and
natasha
exchanged
glances
evidently
wondering
when
would
pierre
noticed
this
but
could
not
felt
uneasy
and
embarrassed
but
sat
because
simply
could
not
get
and
take
his
leave
princess
mary
foreseeing
end
this
rose
first
and
complaining
headache
began
say
good
night
you
are
going
petersburg
tomorrow
she
asked
not
going
pierre
replied
hastily
surprised
tone
and
though
offended
yes
petersburg
tomorrow
but
won
say
good
yet
will
call
round
case
you
have
any
commissions
for
said
standing
before
princess
mary
and
turning
red
but
not
taking
his
departure
natasha
gave
him
her
hand
and
went
out
princess
mary
the
other
hand
instead
going
away
sank
into
armchair
and
looked
sternly
and
intently
him
with
her
deep
radiant
eyes
the
weariness
she
had
plainly
shown
before
had
now
quite
passed
off
with
deep
and
long
drawn
sigh
she
seemed
prepared
for
lengthy
talk
when
natasha
left
the
room
pierre
confusion
and
awkwardness
immediately
vanished
and
were
replaced
eager
excitement
quickly
moved
armchair
toward
princess
mary
yes
wanted
tell
you
said
answering
her
look
she
had
spoken
princess
help
what
can
hope
princess
dear
friend
listen
know
all
know
not
worthy
her
know
impossible
speak
now
but
want
brother
her
not
that
don
can
paused
and
rubbed
his
face
and
eyes
with
his
hands
well
went
with
evident
effort
self
control
and
coherence
don
know
when
began
love
her
but
have
loved
her
and
her
alone
all
life
and
love
her
that
cannot
imagine
life
without
her
cannot
propose
her
present
but
the
thought
that
perhaps
she
might
someday
wife
and
that
may
missing
that
possibility
that
possibility
terrible
tell
can
hope
tell
what
dear
princess
added
after
pause
and
touched
her
hand
she
did
not
reply
thinking
what
you
have
told
answered
princess
mary
this
what
will
say
you
are
right
that
speak
her
love
present
princess
mary
stopped
she
was
going
say
that
speak
love
was
impossible
but
she
stopped
because
she
had
seen
the
sudden
change
natasha
two
days
before
that
she
would
not
only
not
hurt
pierre
spoke
his
love
but
that
was
the
very
thing
she
wished
for
speak
her
now
wouldn
said
the
princess
all
the
same
but
what
leave
said
princess
mary
know
pierre
was
looking
into
princess
mary
eyes
well
well
said
know
that
she
loves
will
love
you
princess
mary
corrected
herself
before
her
words
were
out
pierre
had
sprung
and
with
frightened
expression
seized
princess
mary
hand
what
makes
you
think
you
think
may
hope
you
think
yes
think
said
princess
mary
with
smile
write
her
parents
and
leave
will
tell
her
when
can
wish
happen
and
heart
tells
will
cannot
how
happy
but
can
how
happy
can
pierre
kept
saying
kissed
princess
mary
hands
petersburg
that
will
best
and
will
write
you
she
said
petersburg
there
very
well
but
may
come
again
tomorrow
next
day
pierre
came
say
good
natasha
was
less
animated
than
she
had
been
the
day
before
but
that
day
looked
her
pierre
sometimes
felt
was
vanishing
and
that
neither
nor
she
existed
any
longer
that
nothing
existed
but
happiness
possible
can
told
himself
every
look
gesture
and
word
that
filled
his
soul
with
joy
when
saying
good
took
her
thin
slender
hand
could
not
help
holding
little
longer
his
own
possible
that
this
hand
that
face
those
eyes
all
this
treasure
feminine
charm
strange
now
possible
that
will
one
day
mine
forever
familiar
myself
that
impossible
good
bye
count
she
said
aloud
shall
look
forward
very
much
your
return
she
added
whisper
and
these
simple
words
her
look
and
the
expression
her
face
which
accompanied
them
formed
for
two
months
the
subject
inexhaustible
memories
interpretations
and
happy
meditations
for
pierre
shall
look
forward
very
much
your
return
yes
yes
how
did
she
say
yes
shall
look
forward
very
much
your
return
how
happy
what
happening
how
happy
said
pierre
himself
chapter
xix
there
was
nothing
pierre
soul
now
all
like
what
had
troubled
during
his
courtship
helene
did
not
repeat
himself
with
sickening
feeling
shame
the
words
had
spoken
say
why
did
not
say
that
and
whatever
made
say
vous
aime
the
contrary
now
repeated
imagination
every
word
that
natasha
had
spoken
and
pictured
every
detail
her
face
and
smile
and
did
not
wish
diminish
add
anything
but
only
repeat
again
and
again
there
was
now
not
shadow
doubt
his
mind
whether
what
had
undertaken
was
right
wrong
only
one
terrible
doubt
sometimes
crossed
his
mind
wasn
all
dream
isn
princess
mary
mistaken
not
too
conceited
and
self
confident
believe
all
this
and
suddenly
princess
mary
will
tell
her
and
she
will
sure
smile
and
say
how
strange
must
deluding
himself
doesn
know
that
man
just
man
while
something
altogether
different
and
higher
that
was
the
only
doubt
often
troubling
pierre
did
not
now
make
any
plans
the
happiness
before
him
appeared
inconceivable
that
only
could
attain
would
the
end
all
things
everything
ended
with
that
joyful
unexpected
frenzy
which
had
thought
himself
incapable
possessed
him
the
whole
meaning
life
not
for
him
alone
but
for
the
whole
world
seemed
him
centered
his
love
and
the
possibility
being
loved
her
times
everybody
seemed
him
occupied
with
one
thing
only
his
future
happiness
sometimes
seemed
him
that
other
people
were
all
pleased
was
himself
and
merely
tried
hide
that
pleasure
pretending
busy
with
other
interests
every
word
and
gesture
saw
allusions
his
happiness

surprised
those
met
his
significantly
happy
looks
and
smiles
which
seemed
express
secret
understanding
between
him
and
them
and
when
realized
that
people
might
not
aware
his
happiness
pitied
them
with
his
whole
heart
and
felt
desire
somehow
explain
them
that
all
that
occupied
them
was
mere
frivolous
trifle
unworthy
attention
when
was
suggested
him
that
should
enter
the
civil
service
when
the
war
any
general
political
affairs
were

the

that
everybody
welfare
depended
this
that

events
would
listen
with
mild
and
pitying
smile
and
surprise
people
his
strange
comments
but
this
time
saw
everybody
both
those
who
imagined
understood
the
real
meaning
life
that
what
was
feeling
and
those
unfortunates
who
evidently
did
not
understand
the
bright
light
the
emotion
that
shone
within
himself
and
once
without
any
effort
saw
everyone
met
everything
that
was
good
and
worthy
being
loved
when
dealing
with
the
affairs
and
papers
his
dead
wife
her
memory
aroused
him
feeling
but
pity
that
she
had
not
known
the
bliss
now
knew
prince
vasili
who
having
obtained
new

and
some
fresh

was

this

and
they
always
proved

may
have
appeared
strange
and
queer
then
thought
but
was
not

seemed
the
contrary
was
then
wiser
and
had
more
insight
than
any

understood
all

after

that

with
his

cropped
something
hidden
and
unknown
herself

irrepressible
awoke
natasha

everything
her
face
walk
look
and
voice
was
suddenly
altered
her
own
surprise
power
life
and
hope
happiness
rose
the
surface
and
demanded
satisfaction
from
that
evening
she
seemed
have
forgotten
all
that
had
happened
her
she
longer
complained
her
position
did
not
say
word
about
the
past
and
longer
feared
make
happy
plans
for
the
future
she
spoke
little
pierre
but
when
princess
mary
mentioned
him
long
extinguished
light
once
more
kindled
her
eyes
and
her
lips
curved
with
strange
smile
the
change
that
took
place
natasha
first
surprised
princess
mary
but
when
she
understood
its
meaning
grieved
her
can
she
have
loved
brother
little
able
forget
him
soon
she
thought
when
she
reflected
the
change
but
when
she
was
with
natasha
she
was
not
vexed
with
her
and
did
not
reproach
her
the
reawakened
power
life
that
had
seized
natasha
was
evidently
irrepressible
and
unexpected
her
that
her
presence
princess
mary
felt
that
she
had
right
reproach
her
even
her
heart
natasha
gave
herself
fully
and
frankly
this
new
feeling
that
she
did
not
try
hide
the
fact
that
she
was
longer
sad
but
bright
and
cheerful
when
princess

returned

room
after
her
nocturnal
talk
with

natasha
met
her

repeated
and
joyful
yet
pathetic

which
seemed

forgiveness
for
her
joy

natasha

wanted
listen
the
door
but
knew
you
would
tell
understandable
and
touching
the
look
with
which
natasha
gazed
her
seemed
princess
mary
and
sorry
she
was
see
her
agitation
these
words
pained
her
for
moment
she
remembered
her
brother
and
his
love
but
what
done
she
can
help
thought
the
princess
and
with
sad
and
rather
stern
look
she
told
natasha
all
that
pierre
had
said
hearing
that
was
going
petersburg
natasha
was
astounded
petersburg
she
repeated
unable
understand
but
noticing
the
grieved
expression
princess
mary
face
she
guessed
the
reason
that
sadness
and
suddenly
began
cry
mary
said
she
tell
what
should
afraid
being
bad
whatever
you
tell
will
tell
you
love
him
yes
whispered
natasha
then
why
are
you
crying
happy
for
your
sake
said
princess
mary
who
because
those
tears
quite
forgave
natasha
joy
won
just
yet

what
fun

when
his

asked
you

the

actions
for
which
the
historians
praise
alexander

his
reign
his
struggle
with
napoleon
the
firmness
displayed
and
the

flow
from

sources
the
circumstances
his

the

what
does
the
substance
those

lie
lies
the
fact
that
historic
character
like
alexander
standing
the
highest
possible
pinnacle
human
power
with
the
blinding
light
history
focused
upon
him
character
exposed
those
strongest
all
influences
the

flattery
and
self
deception
inseparable
from

character
who
every
moment
his
life
felt
responsibility
for
all
that
was
happening
europe
and
not
fictitious
but
live
character
who
like
every
man
had
his
personal
habits
passions
and
impulses
toward
goodness
beauty
and
truth
that
this
character
though
not
lacking
virtue
the
historians
not
accuse
him
that
had
not
the

conception
the
welfare

professor
who
from
his
youth
upwards
has
been
occupied
with
learning
that
with
books
and
lectures
and
with
taking
notes
from
them
but
even
assume
that
fifty
years
ago
alexander
was
mistaken
his
view
what
was
good
for
the
people
must
inevitably
assume
that
the
historian
who
judges
alexander
will
also
after
the
lapse
some
time
turn
out
mistaken
his
view
what
good
for
humanity
this
assumption
all
the
more
natural
and
inevitable
because
watching
the
movement
history
see
that
every
year
and
with
each
new
writer
opinion
what
good
for
mankind
changes
that
what
once
seemed
good
ten
years
later
seems
bad
and
vice

and
what
more
find
one
and
the
same
time
quite
contradictory
views
what
bad
and
what
good
history
some
people
regard
giving
constitution
poland
and
forming
the
holy
alliance
praiseworthy
alexander
while
others
regard
blameworthy
the
activity
alexander
napoleon
cannot
called
useful
harmful
for
impossible
say
for
what
was
useful
harmful
that
activity
displeases
somebody
this
only
because
does
not
agree
with
his
limited
understanding
what
good
whether
the

the

the

the

europe
certain
kind
european
culture
called
progress
appear
good
bad
must
admit
that
besides
these
things
the
action
every
historic
character
has
other
more
general
purposes
inaccessible
but
let
assume
that
what
called
science
can
harmonize
all
contradictions
and
possesses
unchanging
standard
good
and
bad
which
try
historic
characters
and
events
let
say
that
alexander
could
have
done
everything
differently
let
say
that
with
guidance
from
those
who
blame
him
and
who
profess
know
the
ultimate
aim
the
movement
humanity
might
have
arranged
matters
according
the
program
his
present
accusers
would
have
given
him
nationality
freedom
equality
and
progress
these
think
cover
the
ground
let
assume
that
this
program
was
possible
and
had
then
been
formulated
and
that
alexander
had
acted

for
nothing
and
deep
his
heart
experienced
gloomy
and
stern
satisfaction
uncomplaining
endurance
his
position
tried
avoid
his
old
acquaintances
with
their
commiseration
and
offensive
offers
assistance
avoided
all
distraction
and
recreation
and
even
home
did
nothing
but
play
cards
with
his
mother
pace
silently
and
down
the
room
and
smoke
one
pipe
after
another
seemed
carefully
cherish
within
himself
the
gloomy
mood
which
alone
enabled
him
endure
his

chapter
the
beginning
winter
princess
mary
came
moscow
from
reports
current
town
she
learned
how
the
rostovs
were
situated
and
how
the
son
has
sacrificed
himself
for
his
mother
people
were
saying
never
expected
anything
else
him
said
princess
mary
herself
feeling
joyous
sense
her
love
for
him
remembering
her
friendly
relations
with
all
the
rostovs
which
had
made
her
almost
member
the
family
she
thought
her
duty
see
them
but
remembering
her
relations
with
nicholas
voronezh
she
was
shy
about
doing
making
great
effort
she
did
however
call
them
few
weeks
after
her
arrival
moscow
nicholas
was
the
first
meet
her
the
countess
room
could
only
reached
through
his
but
instead
being
greeted
with
pleasure
she
had
expected
his
first
glance
her
his
face
assumed
cold
stiff
proud
expression
she
had
not
seen
before
inquired
about
her
health
led
the
way
his
mother
and
having
sat
there
for
five
minutes
left
the
room
when
the
princess
came
out
the
countess
room
nicholas
met
her
again
and
with
marked
solemnity
and
stiffness
accompanied
her
the
anteroom
her
remarks
about
his
mother
health
made
reply
what
that
you
leave
peace
his
looks
seemed
say
why
does
she
come
prowling
here
what
does
she
want
can
bear
these
ladies
and
all
these
civilities
said
aloud
sonya
presence
evidently
unable
repress
his
vexation
after
the
princess
carriage
had
disappeared
nicholas
how
can
you
talk
like
that
cried
sonya
hardly
able
conceal
her
delight
she
kind
and
mamma
fond
her
nicholas
did
not
reply
and
tried
avoid
speaking
the
princess
any
more
but
after
her
visit
the
old
countess
spoke
her
several
times
day
she
sang
her
praises
insisted
that
her
son
must
call
her
expressed
wish
see
her
often
but
yet
always
became
ill
humored
when
she
began
talk
about
her
nicholas
tried
keep
silence
when
his
mother
spoke
the
princess
but
his
silence
irritated
her
she
very
admirable
and
excellent
young
woman
said
she
and
you
must
and
call
her
you
would
least
seeing
somebody
and
think
must
dull
for
you
only
seeing
but
don
the
least
want
mamma
you
used
want
and
now
you
don
really
don
understand
you
dear
one
day
you
are
dull
and
the
next
you
refuse
see
anyone
but
never
said
was
dull
why
you
said
yourself
you
don
want
even
see
her
she
very
admirable
young
woman
and
you
always
liked
her
but
now
suddenly
you
have
got
some
notion
other
your
head
you
hide
everything
from
not
all
mamma
were
asking
you
something
disagreeable
now
but
only
ask
you
return
call
one
would
think
mere
politeness
required
well
have
asked
you
and
now
won
interfere
any
more
since
you
have
secrets
from
your
mother
well
then
you
wish
doesn
matter
only
wish
for
your
sake
nicholas
sighed
bit
his
mustache
and
laid
out
the
cards
for
patience
trying
divert
his
mother
attention
another
topic
the
same
conversation
was
repeated
next
day
and
the
day
after
and
the
day
after
that
after
her
visit
the
rostovs
and
her
unexpectedly
chilly
reception
nicholas
princess
mary
confessed
herself
that
she
had
been
right
not
wishing
the
first
call
expected
nothing
else
she
told
herself
calling
her
pride
her
aid
have
nothing
with
him
and
only
wanted
see
the
old
lady
who
was
always
kind
and
whom
under
many
obligations
but
she
could
not
pacify
herself
with
these
reflections
feeling
akin
remorse
troubled
her
when
she
thought
her
visit
though
she
had
firmly
resolved
not
call
the
rostovs
again
and
forget
the
whole
matter
she
felt
herself
all
the
time
awkward
position
and
when
she
asked
herself
what
distressed
her
she
had
admit
that
was
her
relation
rostov
his
cold
polite
manner
did
not
express
his
feeling
for
her
she
knew
that
but
concealed
something
and
until
she
could
discover
what
that
something
was
she
felt
that
she
could
not
ease
one
day
midwinter
when
sitting
the
schoolroom
attending
her
nephew
lessons
she
was
informed
that
rostov
had
called
with
firm
resolution
not
betray
herself
and
not
show
her
agitation
she
sent
for
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
went
with
her
the
drawing
room
her
first
glance
nicholas
face
told
her
that
had
only
come
fulfill
the
demands
politeness
and
she
firmly
resolved
maintain
the
tone
which
addressed
her
they
spoke
the
countess
health
their
mutual
friends
the
latest
war
news
and
when
the
ten
minutes
required
propriety
had
elapsed
after
which
visitor
may
rise
nicholas
got
say
good
with
mademoiselle
bourienne
help
the
princess
had
maintained
the
conversation
very
well
but
the
very
last
moment
just
when
rose
she
was
tired
talking
what
did
not
interest
her
and
her
mind
was
full
the
question
why
she
alone
was
granted
little
happiness
life
that
fit
absent
mindedness
she
sat
still
her
luminous
eyes
gazing
fixedly
before
her
not
noticing
that
had
risen
nicholas
glanced
her
and
wishing
appear
not
notice
her
abstraction
made
some
remark
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
then
again
looked
the
princess
she
still
sat
motionless
with
look
suffering
her
gentle
face
suddenly
felt
sorry
for
her
and
was
vaguely
conscious
that
might
the
cause
the
sadness
her
face
expressed
wished
help
her
and
say
something
pleasant
but
could
think
nothing
say
good
bye
princess
said
she
started
flushed
and
sighed
deeply
beg
your
pardon
she
said
waking
are
you
going
already
count
well
then
good
but
the
cushion
for
the
countess
wait
moment
fetch
said
mademoiselle
bourienne
and
she
left
the
room
they
both
sat
silent
with
occasional
glance
one
another
yes
princess
said
nicholas
last
with
sad
smile
doesn
seem
long
ago
since
first
met
bogucharovo
but
how
much
water
has
flowed
since
then
what
distress
all
seemed
then
yet
would
give
much
bring
back
that
time
but
there
bringing
back
princess
mary
gazed
intently
into
his
eyes
with
her
own
luminous
ones
said
this
she
seemed
trying
fathom
the
hidden
meaning
his
words
which
would
explain
his
feeling
for
her
yes
yes
said
she
but
you
have
reason
regret
the
past
count
understand
your
present
life
think
you
will
always
recall
with
satisfaction
because
the
self
sacrifice
that
fills
now
cannot
accept
your
praise
interrupted
her
hurriedly
the
contrary
continually
reproach
myself
but
this
not
all
interesting
cheerful
subject
his
face
again
resumed
its
former
stiff
and
cold
expression
but
the
princess
had
caught
glimpse
the
man
she
had
known
and
loved
and
was
him
that
she
now
spoke
thought
you
would
allow
tell
you
this
she
said
had
come
near
you
and
all
your
family
that
thought
you
would
not
consider
sympathy
misplaced
but
was
mistaken
and
suddenly
her
voice
trembled
don
know
why
she
continued
recovering
herself
but
you
used
different
and
there
are
thousand
reasons
why
laying
special
emphasis
the
why
thank
you
princess
added
softly
sometimes
hard
that
why
that
why
voice
whispered
princess
mary
soul
was
not
only
that
gay
kind
and
frank
look
not
only
that
handsome
exterior
that
loved
him
divined
his
noble
resolute
self
sacrificing
spirit
too
she
said
herself
yes
poor
now
and
rich
yes
that
the
only
reason
yes
were
not
for
that
and
remembering
his
former
tenderness
and
looking
now
his
kind
sorrowful
face
she
suddenly
understood
the
cause
his
coldness
but
why
count
why
she
almost
cried
unconsciously
moving
closer
him
why
tell
you
must
tell
was
silent
don
understand
your
why
count
she
continued
but
hard
for
confess
for
some
reason
you
wish
deprive
our
former
friendship
and
that
hurts
there
were
tears
her
eyes
and
her
voice
have
had
little
happiness
life
that
every
loss
hard
for
bear
excuse
good
and
suddenly
she
began
cry
and
was
hurrying
from
the
room
princess
for
god
sake
exclaimed
trying
stop
her
princess
she
turned
round
for
few
seconds
they
gazed
silently
into
one

eyes
and
what
had
seemed
impossible
and
remote
suddenly
became

the
winter
nicholas
married
princess
mary
and
moved
bald

with
his
wife
his
mother
and
sonya
within
four
years
had
paid
off
all
his
remaining
debts
without
selling
any
his

property
and
having
received
small
inheritance

cousin
paid
his

had
managed

was
able
buy
small

adjoining
bald

and
was
negotiating

that
being
his
pet
dream
having
started
farming
from
necessity
soon
grew
devoted
that
became
his
favorite
and
almost
his
sole
occupation
nicholas
was
plain
farmer
did
not
like
innovations
especially
the
english
ones
then
coming
into
vogue
laughed
theoretical
treatises
estate
management
disliked
factories
the
raising
expensive
products
and
the
buying
expensive
seed
corn
and
did
not
make

any
particular
part
the
work
his
estate
always
had
before
his
mind
eye
the
estate
whole
and
not
any
particular
part
the
chief
thing
his
eyes
was
not
the
nitrogen
the
soil
nor
the
oxygen
the
air
nor
manures
nor
special
plows
but
that
most
important
agent
which
nitrogen
oxygen
manure
and
plow
were
made
effective
the
peasant
laborer
when
nicholas
first
began
farming
and
began
understand
its
different
branches
was
the
serf
who
especially
attracted
his
attention
the
peasant
seemed
him
not
merely
tool
but
also
judge
farming
and
end
himself
first
watched
the
serfs
trying
understand
their
aims
and
what
they
considered
good
and
bad
and
only
pretended
direct
them
and
give
orders
while
reality
learning
from
them
their
methods
their
manner
speech
and
their
judgment
what
was
good
and
bad
only
when
had
understood
the
peasants
tastes
and
aspirations
had
learned
talk
their
language
grasp
the
hidden
meaning
their
words
and
felt
akin
them
did
begin
boldly
manage
his
serfs
that
perform
toward
them
the
duties
demanded
him
and
nicholas

produced
very
brilliant
results
guided

men
the
serfs
would
themselves
have
chosen

had
the
right

these

never
changed

before
analyzing
the

entering
into
the

called

out
how
many
cattle
the
peasants
had
and
increased
the
number
all
possible

kept
the
peasant
families
together
the
largest
groups
possible
not
allowing
the

into
separate

was
hard
alike
the
lazy
the
depraved
and
the
weak

careful
the
sowing
and
reaping
the

and

his
own
and
few
landowners
had
their
crops
sown
and
harvested
early
and
well
got
good

nicholas
disliked
having
anything
with
the
domestic
serfs
the
drones
called
them
and
everyone
said
spoiled
them
his
laxity
when
decision
had
taken
regarding
domestic
serf
especially
one
had
punished
always
felt
undecided
and
consulted
everybody
the
house
but
when
was
possible
have
domestic
serf
conscripted
instead
land
worker
did
without
the
least
hesitation
never
felt
any
hesitation
dealing
with
the
peasants
knew
that
his
every
decision
would
approved
them
all
with
very
few
exceptions
did
not
allow
himself
either

make
things
easy
for

anyone
merely
because
felt
inclined
could
not
have
said
what
standard
judged
what
should
should
not
but
the
standard
was
quite
firm
and
definite
his
own
mind
often
speaking
with
vexation
some
failure
irregularity
would
say
what
can
one
with
our
russian
peasants
and
imagined
that
could
not
bear
them
yet
loved
our
russian
peasants
and
their
way
life
with
his
whole
soul
and
for
that
very
reason
had
understood
and
assimilated
the
one
way
and
manner
farming
which
produced
good
results
countess
mary
was
jealous
this
passion
her
husband
and
regretted
that
she
could
not
share
but
she
could
not
understand
the
joys
and
vexations
derived
from
that
world
her
remote
and
alien
she
could
not
understand
why
was
particularly
animated
and
happy
when
after
getting
daybreak
and
spending
the
whole
morning
the
fields
the
threshing
floor
returned
from
the
sowing
mowing
reaping
have
tea
with
her
she
did
not
understand
why
spoke
with
such
admiration
and
delight
the
farming
the
thrifty
and
well
peasant
matthew
ermishin
who
with
his
family
had
carted
corn
all
night
the
fact
that
his
nicholas
sheaves
were
already
stacked
before
anyone
else
had
his
harvest
she
did
not
understand
why
stepped
out
from
the
window
the
veranda
and
smiled
under
his
mustache
and
winked
joyfully
when
warm
steady
rain
began
fall
the
dry
and
thirsty
shoots
the
young
oats
why
when
the
wind
carried
away
threatening
cloud
during
the
hay
harvest
would
return
from
the
barn
flushed
sunburned
and
perspiring
with
smell
wormwood
and
gentian
his
hair
and
gleefully
rubbing
his
hands
would
say
well
one
more
day
and
grain
and
the
peasants
will
all
under
cover
still
less
did
she
understand
why
kindhearted
and
always
ready
anticipate
her
wishes
should
become
almost
desperate
when
she
brought
him
petition
from
some
peasant
men
women
who
had
appealed
her
excused
some
work
why
that
kind
nicholas
should
obstinately
refuse
her
angrily
asking
her
not
interfere
what
was
not
her
business
she
felt
had
world
apart
which
loved
passionately
and
which
had
laws
she
had
not
fathomed
sometimes
when
trying
understand
him
she
spoke
the
good
work
was
doing
for
his
serfs
would
vexed
and
reply
not
the

never
entered

wouldn

either
for

for
and
all
nicholas
did
was
fruitful
probably
just
because
refused
allow
himself

that
was
doing
good
others
for
virtue
sake
his
means
increased
rapidly
serfs
from
neighboring
estates
came
beg
him
buy
them
and
long
after
his
death
the
memory
his
administration
was
devoutly
preserved
among
the

chapter
viii
one
matter
connected
with
his
management
sometimes
worried
nicholas
and
that
was
his
quick
temper
together
with
his
old
hussar
habit
making
free
use
his
fists
first
saw
nothing
reprehensible
this
but
the
second
year
his
marriage
his
view
that
form
punishment
suddenly
changed
once
summer
had
sent
for
the
village
elder
from
bogucharovo
man
who
had
succeeded
the
post
when
dron
died
and
who
was
accused
dishonesty
and
various
irregularities
nicholas
went
out
into
the
porch
question
him
and
immediately
after
the
elder
had
given
few
replies
the
sound
cries
and
blows
were
heard
returning
lunch
nicholas
went
his
wife
who
sat
with
her
head
bent
low
over
her
embroidery
frame
and
usual
began
tell
her
what
had
been
doing
that
morning
among
other
things
spoke
the
bogucharovo
elder
countess
mary
turned
red
and
then
pale
but
continued
sit
with
head
bowed
and
lips
compressed
and
gave
her
husband
reply
such
insolent
scoundrel
cried
growing
hot
again
the
mere
recollection
him
had
told
was
drunk
and
did
not
see
but
what
the
matter
with
you
mary
suddenly
asked
countess
mary
raised
her
head
and
tried
speak
but
hastily
looked
down
again
and
her
lips
puckered
why
whatever
the
matter
dearest
the
looks
the
plain
countess
mary
always
improved
when
she
was
tears
she
never
cried
from
pain
vexation
but
always
from
sorrow
pity
and
when
she
wept
her
radiant
eyes
acquired
irresistible
charm
the
moment
nicholas
took
her
hand
she
could
longer
restrain
herself
and
began
cry
nicholas
saw
was
blame
but
why
you
nicholas
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
nicholas
said
nothing
flushed
crimson
left
her
side
and
paced
and
down
the
room
understood
what
she
was
weeping
about
but
could
not
his
heart
once
agree
with
her
that
what
had
regarded
from
childhood
quite
everyday
event
was
wrong
just
sentimentality
old
wives
tales
she
right
asked
himself
before
had
solved
that
point
glanced
again
her
face
filled
with
love
and
pain
and
suddenly
realized
that
she
was
right
and
that
had
long
been
sinning
against
himself
mary
said
softly
going
her
will
never
happen
again
give
you
word
never
repeated
trembling
voice
like
boy
asking
for
forgiveness
the
tears
flowed
faster
still
from
the
countess
eyes
she
took
his
hand
and
kissed
nicholas
when
did
you
break
your
cameo
she
asked
change
the
subject
looking
his
finger
which
wore
ring
with
cameo
laocoon
head
today
was
the
same
affair
mary
don
remind
and
again
flushed
give
you
word
honor
shan
occur
again
and
let
this
always
reminder
and
pointed
the
broken
ring
after
that
when
discussions
with
his
village
elders
stewards
the
blood
rushed
his
face
and
his
fists
began
clench
nicholas
would
turn
the
broken
ring
his
finger
and
would
drop
his
eyes
before
the
man
who
was
making
him
angry
but
did
forget
himself
once
twice
within
twelvemonth
and
then
would
and
confess
his
wife
and
would
again
promise
that
this
should
really
the
very
last
time
mary
you
must
despise
would
say
deserve
you
should
away
once
you
don
feel
strong
enough
control
yourself
she
would
reply
sadly
trying
comfort
her
husband
among
the
gentry
the
province
nicholas
was
respected
but
not
liked
did
not
concern
himself
with
the
interests
his
own
class
and
consequently
some
thought
him
proud
and
others
thought
him
stupid
the
whole
summer
from
spring
sowing
harvest
was
busy
with
the
work
his
farm
autumn
gave
himself
hunting
with
the
same
business
like
seriousness
leaving
home
for
month
even
two
with
his
hunt
winter
visited
his
other
villages
spent
his
time
reading
the
books
read
were
chiefly
historical
and
these
spent
certain
sum
every
year
was
collecting
said
serious
library
and
made
rule
read
through
all
the
books
bought
would
sit
his
study
with
grave
air
reading
task
first
imposed
upon
himself
duty
but
which
afterwards
became
habit
affording
him
special
kind
pleasure
and
consciousness
being
occupied
with
serious
matters
winter
except
for
business
excursions
spent
most
his
time
home
making
himself
one
with
his
family
and
entering
into
all
the
details
his
children
relations
with
their
mother
the
harmony
between
him
and
his
wife
grew
closer
and
closer
and
daily
discovered
fresh
spiritual
treasures
her
from
the
time
his
marriage
sonya
had
lived
his
house
before
that
nicholas
had
told
his
wife
all
that
had
passed
between
himself
and
sonya
blaming
himself
and
commending
her
had
asked
princess
mary
gentle
and
kind
his
cousin
she
thoroughly
realized
the
wrong
had
done
sonya
felt
herself
blame
toward
her
and
imagined
that
her
wealth
had
influenced
nicholas
choice
she
could
not
find
fault
with
sonya
any
way
and
tried
fond
her
but
often
felt
ill
will
toward
her
which
she
could
not
overcome
once
she
had
talk
with
her
friend
natasha
about
sonya
and
about
her
own
injustice
toward
her
you
know
said
natasha
you
have
read
the
gospels
great
deal
there
passage
them
that
just
fits
sonya
what
asked
countess
mary
surprised
him
that
hath
shall
given
and
from
him
that
hath
not
shall
taken
away
you
remember
she
one
that
hath
not
why
don
know
perhaps
she
lacks
egotism
don
know
but
from
her
taken
away
and
everything
has
been
taken
away
sometimes
dreadfully
sorry
for
her
formerly
very
much
wanted
nicholas
marry
her
but
always
had
sort
presentiment
that
would
not
come
off
she
sterile
flower
you
know
like
some
strawberry
blossoms
sometimes
sorry
for
her
and
sometimes
think
she
doesn
feel
you
would
though
countess
mary
told
natasha
that
those
words
the
gospel
must
understood
differently
yet
looking
sonya
she
agreed
with
natasha
explanation
really
seemed
that
sonya
did
not
feel
her
position
trying
and
had
grown
quite
reconciled
her
lot
sterile
flower
she
seemed
fond
not
much
individuals
the
family
whole
like
cat
she
had
attached
herself
not
the
people
but
the
home
she
waited
the
old
countess
petted
and
spoiled
the
children
was
always
ready
render
the
small
services
for
which
she
had
gift
and
all
this
was
unconsciously
accepted
from
her
with
insufficient
gratitude
the
country

hills
had
been
rebuilt
though
not

same
scale
under
the
old

sometimes
came

and
then
receive
visitors
who
would
come
congratulate
him
offer
them
refreshments
and
talk
about
the
elections
the
nobility
but
considered
himself
entitled
spend
the
eve
that
day
his
usual
way
examined
the
bailiff
accounts
the
village
ryazan
which
belonged
his
wife
nephew
wrote
two
business
letters
and
walked
over
the
granaries
cattle
yards
and
stables
before
dinner
having
taken
precautions
against
the
general
drunkenness
expected
the
morrow
because
was
great
saint
day
returned
dinner
and
without
having
time
for
private
talk
with
his
wife
sat
down
the
long
table
laid
for
twenty
persons
which
the
whole
household
had
assembled

table
were
his
mother
his

who
was
living
retirement
bald
hills
countess
mary
sat
the
other
end
the
table
when
her
husband
took
his
place
she
concluded
from
the
rapid
manner
which
after
taking
his
table
napkin
pushed
back
the
tumbler
and
wineglass
standing
before
him
that
was
out
humor
was
sometimes
the
case
when
came
dinner
straight
from
the
farm
especially
before
the
soup
countess
mary
well
knew
that
mood
his
and
when
she
herself
was
good
frame
mind
quietly
waited
till
had
had
his
soup
and
then
began
talk
him
and
make
him
admit
that
there
was
cause
for
his
ill
humor
but
today
she
quite
forgot
that
and
was
hurt
that
should
angry
with
her
without
any
reason
and
she
felt
unhappy
she
asked
him
where
had
been
replied
she
again
inquired
whether
everything
was
going
well
the
farm
her
unnatural
tone
made
him
wince
unpleasantly
and
replied
hastily
then
not
mistaken
thought
countess
mary
why
cross
with
she
concluded
from
his
tone
that
was
vexed
with
her
and
wished
end
the
conversation
she
knew
her
remarks
sounded
unnatural
but
could
not
refrain
from
asking
some
more
questions
thanks
denisov
the
conversation
table
soon
became
general
and
lively
and
she
did
not
talk
her
husband
when
they
left
the
table
and
went
usual
thank
the
old
countess
countess
mary
held
out
her
hand
and
kissed
her
husband
and
asked
him
why
was
angry
with
her
you
always
have
such
strange
fancies
didn
even
think
being
angry
replied
but
the
word
always
seemed
her
imply
yes
angry
but
won
tell
you
why
nicholas
and
his
wife
lived
together
happily
that
even
sonya
and
the
old
countess
who
felt
jealous
and
would
have
liked
them
disagree
could
find
nothing
reproach
them
with
but
even
they
had
their
moments
antagonism
occasionally
and
was
always
just
after
they
had
been
happiest
together
they
suddenly
had
feeling
estrangement
and
hostility
which
occurred
most
frequently
during
countess
mary
pregnancies
and
this
was
such
time
well
messieurs
mesdames
said
nicholas
loudly
and
with
apparent
cheerfulness
seemed
countess
mary
that
did
purpose
vex
her
have
been
feet
since
six
this
morning
tomorrow
shall
have
suffer
today
and
rest
and
without
word
his
wife
went
the
little
sitting
room
and
lay
down
the
sofa
that
always
the
way
thought
countess
mary
talks
everyone
except
see
see
that
repulsive
him
especially
when
this
condition
she
looked
down
her
expanded
figure
and
the
glass
her
pale
sallow
emaciated
face
which
her
eyes
now
looked
larger
than
ever
and
everything
annoyed
her
denisov
shouting
and
laughter
natasha
talk
and
especially
quick
glance
sonya
gave
her
sonya
was
always
the
first
excuse
countess
mary
found
for
feeling
irritated
having
sat
awhile
with
her
visitors
without
understanding
anything
what
they
were
saying
she
softly
left
the
room
and
went
the
nursery
the
children
were
playing
going
moscow
carriage
made
chairs
and
invited
her
with
them
she
sat
down
and
played
with
them
little
but
the
thought
her
husband
and
his
unreasonable
crossness
worried
her
she
got
and
walking
tiptoe
with
difficulty
went
the
small
sitting
room
perhaps
not
asleep
have
explanation
with
him
she
said
herself
little
andrew
her
eldest
boy
imitating
his
mother
followed
her
tiptoe
she
did
not
notice
him
mary
dear
think
asleep
was
tired
said
sonya
meeting
her
the
large
sitting
room
seemed
countess
mary
that
she
crossed
her
path
everywhere
andrew
may
wake
him
countess
mary
looked
round
saw
little
andrew
following
her
felt
that
sonya
was
right
and
for
that
very
reason
flushed
and
with
evident
difficulty
refrained
from
saying
something
harsh
she
made
reply
but
avoid
obeying
sonya
beckoned
andrew
follow
her
quietly
and
went
the
door
sonya
went
away
another
door
from
the
room
which
nicholas
was
sleeping
came
the
sound
his
even
breathing
every
slightest
tone
which
was
familiar
his
wife
she
listened
she
saw
before
her
his
smooth
handsome
forehead
his
mustache
and
his
whole
face
she
had
often
seen
the
stillness
the
night
when
slept
nicholas
suddenly
moved
and
cleared
his
throat
and
that
moment
little
andrew
shouted
from
outside
the
door

standing
here
countess
mary
turned
pale
with
fright
and
made
signs
the
boy
grew
silent
and
quiet
ensued
for
moment
terrible
countess
mary
she
knew
how
nicholas
disliked
being
waked
then
through
the
door
she
heard
nicholas
clearing
his
throat
again
and
stirring
and
his
voice
said
crossly

mary
that

you
bring
him
here
only
came

and
did
not
notice

and
said
more

moved
away
from
the
door
and
took
the
boy

some
remark
and

began
thinking
aloud
her
thoughts
were
about
the
children
you
can
see
the
woman
her
already
she
said
french
pointing
little
natasha
you
reproach
women
with
being
illogical
here
our
logic
say
papa

sleep
but
she
says
laughing
and
she
was
right
said
countess
mary
with
happy
smile
yes
yes
and
nicholas
taking
his
little
daughter
his
strong
hand
lifted
her
high
placed
her
his
shoulder
held
her
the
legs
and
paced
the
room
with
her
there
was
expression
carefree
happiness
the
faces
both
father
and

but
you

you
may
unfair

too
fond
this
one
his
wife
whispered
french

what

that
moment
they
heard
the
sound
the
door
pulley
and
footsteps
the
hall
and
anteroom
someone
had
arrived
somebody
has
come
sure
pierre

said
countess
mary
and
left
the
room
her
absence
nicholas
allowed
himself
give
his
little
daughter
gallop
round
the
room
out
breath
took
the
laughing
child
quickly
from
his
shoulder
and
pressed
her
his
heart
his
capers
reminded
him
dancing
and
looking
the
child
round
happy
little
face
thought
what
she
would
like
when
was
old
man
taking
her
into
society
and
dancing
the
mazurka
with
her
his
old
father
had
danced
daniel
cooper
with
his
daughter
nicholas
said
countess
mary
entering
the
room
few
minutes
later
now
our
natasha
has
come
life
you
should
have
seen
her
ecstasy
and
how
caught
for

long
well

added
looking
smilingly
the
little
girl
who
clung
her
father
nicholas
went
out
holding
the
child
the
hand
countess
mary
remained
the
sitting
room
should
never
never
have
believed
that
one
could
happy
she
whispered
herself
smile
lit
her
face
but
the
same
time
she
sighed
and
her
deep
eyes
expressed
quiet
sadness
though
she
felt
through
her
happiness
that
there
another
sort
happiness
unattainable
this
life
and
which
she
involuntarily
thought
that
instant
chapter
natasha
had
married
the
early
spring
and
already
had
three
daughters
besides
son
for
whom
she
had
longed
and
whom
she
was
now
nursing
she
had
grown
stouter
and
broader
that
was
difficult
recognize
this
robust
motherly
woman
the
slim
lively
natasha
former
days
her
features
were
more
defined
and
had
calm
soft
and
serene
expression
her
face
there
was

face
and

were

all
that
one
saw
and
her
soul
was
not
visible
all
all
that
struck
the
eye
was
strong
handsome
and
fertile
woman
the
old
fire
very
rarely
kindled
her

that
happened
only
when
was
the

that
day
her

something
happened
induce
her

she
had
quite
abandoned
since
her
marriage
the
rare
moments
when
the
old
fire
did
kindle
her
handsome
fully
developed
body
she
was
even
more
attractive
than
former
days
since
their
marriage
natasha
and
her
husband
had
lived
moscow
petersburg
their
estate
near
moscow
with
her
mother
that
say
nicholas
house
the
young
countess
bezukhova
was
not
often
seen
society
and
those
who
met
her
there
were
not
pleased
with
her
and
found
her
neither
attractive
nor
amiable
not
that
natasha
liked
solitude
she
did
not
know
whether
she
liked
not
she
even
thought
that
she
did
not
but
with
her
pregnancies
her
confinements
the
nursing
her
children
and
sharing
every
moment
her
husband
life
she
had
demands
her
time
which
could
satisfied
only
renouncing
society
all
who
had
known
natasha
before
her
marriage
wondered
the
change
her
something
extraordinary
only
the
old
countess
with
her
maternal
instinct
had
realized
that
all
natasha
outbursts
had
been
due
her
need
children
and
husband
she
herself
had
once
exclaimed
otradnoe
not
much
fun
earnest
and
her
mother
was
now
surprised
the
surprise
expressed
those
who
had
never
understood
natasha
and
she
kept
saying
that
she
had
always
known
that
natasha
would
make
exemplary
wife
and
mother
only
she
lets
her
love
her
husband
and
children
overflow
all
bounds
said
the
countess
that
even
becomes
absurd
natasha
did
not
follow
the
golden
rule
advocated
clever
folk
especially
the
french
which
says
that
girl
should
not
let
herself
when
she
marries
should
not
neglect
her
accomplishments
should
even
more
careful
her
appearance
than
when
she
was
unmarried
and
should
fascinate
her
husband
much
she
did
before
became
her
husband
natasha
the
contrary
had
once
abandoned
all
her
witchery
which
her
singing
had
been
unusually
powerful
part
she
gave
just
because
was
powerfully
seductive
she
took
pains
with
her
manners
with
delicacy
speech
with
her
toilet
show
herself
her
husband
her
most
becoming
attitudes
avoid
inconveniencing
him
being
too
exacting
she
acted
contradiction
all
those
rules
she
felt
that
the
allurements
instinct
had
formerly
taught
her
use
would
now
merely
ridiculous
the
eyes
her
husband
whom
she
had
from
the
first
moment
given
herself
entirely
that
with
her
whole
soul
leaving
corner
hidden
from
him
she
felt
that
her
unity
with
her
husband
was
not
maintained
the
poetic
feelings
that
had
attracted
him
her
but
something
else
indefinite
but
firm
the
bond
between
her
own
body
and
soul
fluff
out
her
curls
put
fashionable
dresses
and
sing
romantic
songs
fascinate
her
husband
would
have
seemed
strange
adorn
herself
attract
herself
adorn
herself
for
others
might
perhaps
have
been
agreeable
she
did
not
know
but
she
had
time
all
for
the
chief
reason
for
devoting
time
either
singing
dress
choosing
her
words
was
that
she
really
had
time
spare
for
these
things
know
that
man
has
the
faculty
becoming
completely
absorbed
subject
however
trivial
may
and
that
there
subject
trivial
that
will
not
grow
infinite
proportions
one
entire
attention
devoted
the
subject
which
wholly
engrossed
natasha
attention
was
her
family
that
her
husband
whom
she
had
keep
that
should
belong
entirely
her
and
the
home
and
the
children
whom
she
had
bear
bring
into
the
world
nurse
and
bring
and
the
deeper
she
penetrated
not
with
her
mind
only
but
with
her
whole
soul
her
whole
being
into
the
subject
that
absorbed
her
the
larger
did
that
subject
grow
and
the
weaker
and
more
inadequate
did
her
powers
appear
that
she
concentrated
them
wholly
that
one
thing
and
yet
was
unable
accomplish
all
that
she
considered
necessary
there
were
then
now
conversations
and
discussions
about
women
rights
the
relations
husband
and
wife
and
their
freedom
and
rights
though
these
themes
were
not
yet
termed
questions
they
are
now
but
these
topics
were
not
merely
uninteresting
natasha
she
positively
did
not
understand
them
these
questions
then
now
existed
only
for
those
who
see
nothing
marriage
but
the
pleasure
married
people
get
from
one
another
that
only
the
beginnings
marriage
and
not
its
whole
significance
which
lies
the
family
discussions
and
questions
that
kind
which
are
like
the
question
how
get
the
greatest
gratification
from
one
dinner
did
not
then
and
not
now
exist
for
those
for
whom
the
purpose
dinner
the
nourishment
affords
and
the
purpose
marriage
the
family
the
purpose
dinner
nourish
the
body
man
who
eats
two
dinners
once
may
perhaps
get
more
enjoyment
but
will
not
attain
his
purpose
for
his
stomach
will
not
digest
the
two
dinners
the
purpose
marriage
the
family
the
person
who
wishes
have
many
wives
husbands
may
perhaps
obtain
much
pleasure
but
that
case
will
not
have
family
the
purpose
food
nourishment
and
the
purpose
marriage
the
family
the
whole
question
resolves
itself
into
not
eating
more
than
one
can
digest
and
not
having
more
wives
husbands
than
are
needed
for
the
family
that
one
wife
one
husband
natasha
needed
husband
husband
was
given
her
and
gave
her
family
and
she
not
only
saw
need
any
other
better
husband
but
all
the
powers
her
soul
were
intent
serving
that
husband
and
family
she
could
not
imagine
and
saw
interest
imagining
how
would
things
were
different
natasha
did
not
care
for
society
general
but
prized
the
more
the
society
her
relatives
countess
mary
and
her
brother
her
mother
and
sonya
she
valued
the
company
those
whom
she
could
come
striding
disheveled
from
the
nursery
her
dressing
gown
and
with
joyful
face
show
yellow
instead
green
stain
baby
napkin
and
from
whom
she
could
hear
reassuring
words
the
effect
that
baby
was
much
better
such
extent
had
natasha
let
herself
that
the
way
she
dressed
and
did
her
hair
her
ill
chosen
words
and
her
jealousy
she
was
jealous
sonya
the
governess
and
every
woman
pretty
plain
were
habitual
subjects
jest
those
about
her
the
general
opinion
was
that
pierre
was
under
his
wife
thumb
which
was
really
true
from
the
very
first
days
their
married
life
natasha
had
announced
her
demands
pierre
was
greatly
surprised
his
wife
view
him
perfectly
novel
one
that
every
moment
his
life
belonged
her
and
the
family
his
wife
demands
astonished
him
but
they
also
flattered
him
and
submitted
them
pierre
subjection
consisted
the
fact
that
not
only
dared
not
flirt
with
but
dared
not
even
speak
smilingly
any
other
woman
did
not
dare
dine
the
club
pastime
did
not
dare
spend
money
whim
and
did
not
dare
absent
himself
for
any
length
time
except
business
which
his
wife
included
his
intellectual
pursuits
which
she
did
not
the
least
understand
but
which
she
attributed
great
importance
make
for
this
home
pierre
had
the
right
regulate
his
life
and
that
the
whole
family
exactly
chose
home
natasha
placed
herself
the
position
slave
her
husband
and
the
whole
household
went
tiptoe
when
was
occupied
that
was
reading
writing
his
study
pierre
had
but
show
partiality
for
anything
get
just
what
liked
done
always
had
only
express
wish
and
natasha
would
jump
and
run
fulfill
the
entire
household
was
governed
according
pierre
supposed
orders
that
his
wishes
which
natasha
tried
guess
their
way
life
and
place
residence
their
acquaintances
and
ties
natasha
occupations
the
children
upbringing
were
all
selected
not
merely
with
regard
pierre
expressed
wishes
but
what
natasha
from
the
thoughts
expressed
conversation
supposed
his
wishes
and
she
deduced
the
essentials
his
wishes
quite
correctly
and
having
once
arrived
them
clung
them
tenaciously
when
pierre
himself
wanted
change
his
mind
she
would
fight
him
with
his
own
weapons
thus
time
trouble
ever
memorable
him
after
the
birth
their
first
child
who
was
delicate
when
they
had
change
the
wet
nurse
three
times
and
natasha
fell
ill
from
despair
pierre
one
day
told
her
rousseau
view
with
which
quite
agreed
that
have
wet
nurse
unnatural
and
harmful
when
her
next
baby
was
born
despite
the
opposition
her
mother
the
doctors
and
even
her
husband
himself
who
were
all
vigorously
opposed
her
nursing
her
baby
herself
thing
then
unheard
and
considered
injurious
she
insisted
having
her
own
way
and
after
that
nursed
all
her
babies
herself
very
often
happened
that
moment
irritation
husband
and
wife
would
have
dispute
but
long
afterwards
pierre
his
surprise
and
delight
would
find
his
wife
ideas
and
actions
the
very
thought
against
which
she
had
argued
but
divested
everything
superfluous
that
the
excitement
the
dispute
had
added
when
expressing
his
opinion
after
seven
years
marriage
pierre
had
the
joyous
and
firm
consciousness
that
was
not
bad
man
and
felt
this
because
saw
himself
reflected
his
wife
felt
the
good
and
bad
within
himself
inextricably
mingled
and
overlapping
but
only
what
was
really
good
him
was
reflected
his
wife
all
that
was
not
quite
good
was
rejected
and
this
was
not
the
result
logical
reasoning
but
was
direct
and
mysterious
reflection
chapter
two
months
previously
when
pierre
was
already
staying
with
the
rostovs
had
received
letter
from
prince
theodore
asking
him
come
petersburg
confer
some
important
questions
that
were
being
discussed
there
society
which
pierre
was
one
the
principal
founders
reading
that
letter
she
always
read
her
husband
letters
natasha
herself
suggested
that
should
petersburg
though
she
would
feel
his
absence
very
acutely
she
attributed
immense
importance
all
her
husband
intellectual
and
abstract
interests
though
she
did
not
understand
them
and
she
always
dreaded
being
hindrance
him
such
matters
pierre
timid
look
inquiry
after
reading
the
letter
she
replied
asking
him
but
fix
definite
date
for
his
return
was
given
four
weeks
leave
absence
ever
since
that
leave
absence
had
expired
more
than
fortnight
before
natasha
had
been
constant
state
alarm
depression
and
irritability
denisov
now
general
the
retired
list
and
much
dissatisfied
with
the
present
state
affairs
had
arrived
during
that
fortnight
looked
natasha
with
sorrow
and
surprise
bad
likeness
person
once
dear
dull
dejected
look
random
replies
and
talk
about
the
nursery
was
all
saw
and
heard
from
his
former
enchantress
natasha
was
sad
and
irritable
all
that
time
especially
when
her
mother
her
brother
sonya
countess
mary
their
efforts
console
her
tried
excuse
pierre
and
suggested
reasons
for
his
delay
returning
all
nonsense
all
rubbish
those
discussions
which
lead
nothing
and
all
those
idiotic
societies
natasha
declared
the
very
affairs
the
immense
importance
which
she
firmly
believed
and
she
would
the
nursery
nurse
petya
her
only
boy
one
else
could
tell
her
anything
comforting
reasonable
this
little
three
month
old
creature
when
lay
her
breast
and
she
was
conscious
the
movement
his
lips
and
the
snuffling
his
little
nose
that
creature
said
you
are
angry
you
are
jealous
you
would
like
pay
him
out
you
are
afraid
but
here
and
and
that
was
unanswerable
was
more
than
true
during
that
fortnight
anxiety
natasha
resorted
the
baby
for
comfort
often
and
fussed
over
him
much
that
she
overfed
him
and
fell
ill
she
was
terrified
his
illness
and
yet
that
was
just
what
she
needed
while
attending
him
she
bore
the
anxiety
about
her
husband
more
easily
she
was
nursing
her
boy
when
the
sound
pierre
sleigh
was
heard
the
front
door
and
the
old
nurse
knowing
how
please
her
mistress
entered
the
room
inaudibly
but
hurriedly
and
with
beaming
face
has
come
natasha
asked
quickly
whisper
afraid
move
lest
she
should
rouse
the
dozing
baby
come
whispered
the
nurse
the
blood
rushed
natasha
face
and
her
feet
involuntarily
moved
but
she
could
not
jump
and
run
out
the
baby
again
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
her
you
here
seemed
saying
and
again
lazily
smacked
his
lips
cautiously
withdrawing
her
breast
natasha
rocked
him
little
handed
him
the
nurse
and
went
with
rapid
steps
toward
the
door
but
the
door
she
stopped
her
conscience
reproached
her
for
having
her
joy
left
the
child
too
soon
and
she
glanced
round
the
nurse
with
raised
elbows
was
lifting
the
infant
over
the
rail
his
cot
don
worry
she
whispered
smiling
with
the
kind
familiarity
that
grows
between
nurse
and
her
mistress
natasha
ran
with
light
footsteps
the
anteroom
denisov
who
had
come
out
the
study
into
the
dancing
room
with
his
pipe
now
for
the
first
time
recognized
the
old
natasha
flood
brilliant
joyful
light
poured
from
her
transfigured
face
come
she
exclaimed
she
ran
past
and
denisov
felt
that
too
was
delighted
that
pierre
whom
did
not
much
care
for
had
returned
reaching
the
vestibule
natasha
saw
tall
figure
fur
coat
unwinding
his
scarf
really
has
come
she
said
herself
and
rushing
him
embraced
him
pressed
his
head
her
breast
and
then
pushed
him
back
and
gazed
his
ruddy
happy
face
covered
with
hoarfrost
yes
happy
and
contented
then
all
once
she
remembered
the
tortures
suspense
she
had
experienced
for
the
last
fortnight
and
the
joy
that
had
lit
her
face
vanished
she
frowned
and
overwhelmed
pierre
with
torrent
reproaches
and
angry
words
yes
all
very
well
for
you
you
are
pleased
you
had
good
time
but
what
about
you
might
least
have
shown
consideration
for
the
children
nursing
and
milk
was
spoiled
petya
was
death
door
but
you
were
enjoying
yourself
yes
enjoying
pierre
knew
was
not
blame
for
could
not
have
come
sooner
knew
this
outburst
was
unseemly
and
would
blow
over
minute
two
above
all
knew
that
himself
was
bright
and
happy
wanted
smile
but
dared
not
even
think
doing
made
piteous
frightened
face
and
bent
down
could
not
honor
but
how
petya
all
right
now
come
along
wonder
you
not
ashamed
only
you
could
see
what
was
like
without
you
how
suffered
you
are
well
come
come
she
said
not
letting
his
arm
and
they
went
their
rooms
when
nicholas
and
his
wife
came
look
for
pierre
was
the
nursery
holding
his
baby
son
who
was
again
awake
his
huge
right
palm
and
dandling
him
blissful
bright
smile
was
fixed
the
baby
broad
face
with
its
toothless
open
mouth
the
storm
was
long
since
over
and
there
was
bright
joyous
sunshine
natasha
face
she
gazed
tenderly
her
husband
and
child
and
have
you
talked
everything
well
over
with
prince
theodore
she
asked
yes
capitally
you
see
holds
she
meant
the
baby
head
but
how
did
frighten
you
seen
the
princess
true
she
love
with
that
yes
just
fancy
that
moment
nicholas
and
countess
mary
came
pierre
with
the
baby
his
hand
stooped
kissed
them
and
replied
their
inquiries
but
spite
much
that
was
interesting
and
had
discussed
the
baby
with
the
little
cap
its
unsteady
head
evidently
absorbed
all
his
attention
how
sweet
said
countess
mary
looking
and
playing
with
the
baby
now
nicholas
she
added
turning
her
husband
can
understand
how
you
don
see
the
charm
these
delicious
marvels
don
and
can
replied
nicholas
looking
coldly
the
baby
lump
flesh
come
along
pierre
and
yet
such
affectionate
father
said
countess
mary
vindicating
her
husband
but
only
after
they
are

old
now
pierre

them
splendidly
said
natasha
says
his

just
made
for

suddenly
exclaimed
with
laugh
and
shifting
the

gave

chapter

every
large
household
there
were
bald
hills
several
perfectly
distinct
worlds
which
merged
into
one
harmonious
whole
though
each
retained
its
own
peculiarities
and
made
concessions
the
others
every

joyful
sad
that
took
place
that

was

all
these
worlds
but
each
had
its
own
special
reasons
rejoice
grieve
over
that
occurrence
independently
the
others
for
instance
pierre
return
was
joyful
and
important
event
and
they
all
felt
the
servants
the
most
reliable
judges
their
masters
because
they
judge
not
their
conversation
expressions
feeling
but
their
acts
and
way
life
were
glad
pierre

because
they
knew
that
when
was
there
count
nicholas
would
cease
going
every
day
attend
the
estate
and
would
better
spirits
and
temper
and
also
because
they
would
all
receive
handsome
presents
for
the
holidays
the
children
and
their
governesses
were
glad
pierre
return
because
one
else
drew
them
into
the
social
life
the
household
did
alone
could
play
the
clavichord
that
ecossaise
his
only
piece
which
said
all
possible
dances
could
danced
and
they
felt
sure
had
brought
presents
for
them
all
young
nicholas
now
slim
lad
fifteen
delicate
and
intelligent
with
curly
light
brown
hair
and
beautiful
eyes
was
delighted
because
uncle
pierre
called
him
was
the
object
his
rapturous
and
passionate
affection
one
had
instilled
into
him
this
love
for
pierre
whom
saw
only
occasionally
countess
mary
who
had
brought
him
had
done
her
utmost
make
him
love
her
husband
she
loved
him
and
little
nicholas
did
love
his
uncle
but
loved
him
with
just
shade
contempt
pierre
however
adored
did
not
want
hussar
knight
george
like
his
uncle
nicholas
wanted
learned
wise
and
kind
like
pierre
pierre
presence
his
face
always
shone
with
pleasure
and
flushed
and
was
breathless
when
pierre
spoke
him
did
not
miss
single
word
uttered
and
would
afterwards
with
dessalles
himself
recall
and
reconsider
the
meaning
everything
pierre
had
said
pierre
past
life
and
his
unhappiness
prior
which
young
nicholas
had
formed
vague
poetic
picture
from
some
words
had
overheard
his
adventures
moscow
his
captivity
platon
karataev
whom
had
heard
from
pierre
his
love
for
natasha
whom
the
lad
was
also
particularly
fond
and
especially
pierre
friendship
with
the
father
whom
nicholas
could
not
remember
all
this
made
pierre
his
eyes
hero
and
saint
from
broken
remarks
about
natasha
and
his
father
from
the
emotion
with
which
pierre
spoke
that
dead
father
and
from
the
careful
reverent
tenderness
with
which
natasha
spoke
him
the
boy
who
was
only
just
beginning
guess
what
love
derived
the
notion
that
his
father
had
loved
natasha
and
when
dying
had
left
her
his
friend
but
the
father
whom
the
boy
did
not
remember
appeared
him
divinity
who
could
not
pictured
and
whom
never
thought
without
swelling
heart
and
tears
sadness
and
rapture
the
boy
also
was
happy
that
pierre
had
arrived
the
guests
welcomed
pierre
because
always
helped
enliven
and
unite
any
company
was
the
grown
members
the
family
not
mention
his
wife
were
pleased
have
back
friend
whose
presence
made
life
run
more
smoothly
and
peacefully
the
old
ladies
were
pleased
with
the
presents
brought
them
and
especially
that
natasha
would
now
herself
again
pierre
felt
the
different
outlooks
these
various
worlds
and
made
haste
satisfy
all
their
expectations
though
the
most
absent
minded
and
forgetful
men
pierre
with
the
aid
list
his
wife
drew
had
now
bought
everything
not
forgetting
his
mother
and
brother
law
commissions
nor
the
dress
material
for
present
belova
nor
toys
for
his
wife
nephews
the
early
days
his
marriage
had
seemed
strange
him
that
his
wife
should
expect
him
not
forget
procure
all
the
things
undertook
buy
and
had
been
taken
aback
her
serious
annoyance
when
his
first
trip
forgot
everything
but
time
grew
used
this
demand
knowing
that
natasha
asked
nothing
for
herself
and
gave
him
commissions
for
others
only
when
himself
had
offered
undertake
them
now
found
unexpected
and
childlike
pleasure
this
purchase
presents
for
everyone
the
house
and
never
forgot
anything
now
incurred
natasha
censure
was
only
for
buying
too
many
and
too
expensive
things
her
other
defects
most
people
thought
them
but
which
pierre
were
qualities
untidiness
and
neglect
herself
she
now
added
stinginess
from
the
time
that
pierre
began
life
family
man
footing
entailing
heavy
expenditure
had
noticed
his
surprise
that
spent
only
half
much
before
and
that
his
affairs
which
had
been
disorder
late
chiefly
because
his
first
wife
debts
had
begun
improve
life
was
cheaper
because
was
circumscribed
that
most
expensive
luxury
the
kind
life
that
can
changed
any
moment
was
longer
his
nor
did
wish
for
felt
that
his
way
life
had
now
been
settled
once
for
all
till
death
and
that
change
was
not
his
power
and
that
way
life
proved
economical
with
merry
smiling
face
pierre
was
sorting
his
purchases
what
you
think
this
said
unrolling
piece
stuff
like
shopman
natasha
who
was
sitting
opposite
him
with
her
eldest
daughter
her
lap
turned
her
sparkling
eyes
swiftly
from
her
husband
the
things
showed
her
that
for
belova
excellent
she
felt
the
quality
the
material
was
ruble
arshin
suppose
pierre
told
her
the
price
too
dear
natasha
remarked
how
pleased
the
children
will
and
mamma
too
only
you
need
not
have
bought
this
she
added
unable
suppress
smile
she
gazed
admiringly
gold
comb
set
with
pearls
kind
then
just
coming
into
fashion
adele
tempted
she
kept
telling
buy
returned
pierre
when
wear
and
natasha
stuck
her
coil
hair
when
take
little
masha
into
society
perhaps
they
will
fashionable
again
then
well
let
now
and
collecting
the
presents
they
went
first
the
nursery
and
then
the
old
countess
rooms
the
countess
was
sitting
with
her
companion
belova
playing
grand
patience
usual
when
pierre
and
natasha
came
into
the
drawing
room
with
parcels
under
their
arms
the
countess
was
now
over
sixty
was
quite
gray
and
wore
cap
with
frill
that
surrounded
her
face
her
face
had
shriveled
her
upper
lip
had
sunk
and
her
eyes
were
dim
after
the
deaths
her
son
and
husband
such
rapid
succession
she
felt
herself
being
accidentally
forgotten
this
world
and
left
without
aim
object
for
her
existence
she
ate
drank
slept
kept
awake
but
did
not
live
life
gave
her
new
impressions
she
wanted
nothing
from
life
but
tranquillity
and
that
tranquillity
only
death
could
give
her
but
until
death
came
she
had
living
that
use
her
vital
forces
peculiarity
one
sees
very
young
children
and
very
old
people
was
particularly
evident
her
her
life
had
external
aims
only
need
exercise
her
various
functions
and
inclinations
was
apparent
she
had
eat
sleep
think
speak
weep
work
give
vent
her
anger
and
merely
because
she
had
stomach
brain
muscles
nerves
and
liver
she
did
these
things
not
under
any
external
impulse
people
the
full
vigor
life
when
behind
the
purpose
for
which
they
strive
that
exercising
their
functions
remains
unnoticed
she
talked
only
because
she
physically
needed
exercise
her
tongue
and
lungs
she
cried
child
does
because
her
nose
had
cleared
and
what
for
people
their
full
vigor
aim
was
for
her
evidently
merely
pretext
thus
the
morning
especially
she
had
eaten
anything
rich
the
day
before
she
felt
need
being
angry
and
would
choose
the
handiest
pretext
belova
deafness
she
would
begin
say
something
her
low
tone
from
the
other
end
the
room
seems
little
warmer
today
dear
she
would
murmur
and
when
belova
replied
yes
they
come
she
would
mutter
angrily
lord
how
stupid
and
deaf
she
another
pretext
would
her
snuff
which
would
seem
too
dry
too
damp
not
rubbed
fine
enough
after
these
fits
irritability
her
face
would
grow
yellow
and
her
maids
knew
infallible
symptoms
when
belova
would
again
deaf
the
snuff
damp
and
the
countess
face
yellow
just
she
needed
work
off
her
spleen
she
had
sometimes
exercise
her
still
existing
faculty
thinking
and
the
pretext
for
that
was
game
patience
when
she
needed
cry
the
deceased
count
would
the
pretext
when
she
wanted
agitated
nicholas
and
his
health
would
the
pretext
and
when
she
felt
need
speak
spitefully
the
pretext
would
countess
mary
when
her
vocal
organs
needed
exercise
which
was
usually
toward
seven
clock
when
she
had
had
after
dinner
rest
darkened
room
the
pretext
would
the
retelling
the
same
stories
over
and
over
again
the
same
audience
the
old
lady
condition
was
understood
the
whole
household
though
one
ever
spoke
and
they
all
made
every
possible
effort
satisfy
her
needs
only
rare
glance
exchanged
with
sad
smile
between
nicholas
pierre
natasha
and
countess
mary
was
the
common
understanding
her
condition
expressed
but
those
glances
expressed
something
more
they
said
that
she
had
played
her
part
life
that
what
they
now
saw
was
not
her
whole
self
that
must
all
become
like
her
and
that
they
were
glad
yield
her
restrain
themselves
for
this
once
precious
being
formerly
full
life
themselves
but
now
much
pitied
memento
mori
said
these
glances
only
the
really
heartless
the
stupid
ones
that
household
and
the
little
children
failed
understand
this
and
avoided
her
chapter
xiii
when
pierre
and
his
wife
entered
the
drawing
room
the
countess
was
one
her
customary
states
which
she
needed
the
mental
exertion
playing
patience
and
though
force
habit
she
greeted
him
with
the
words
she
always
used
when
pierre
her
son
returned
after
absence
high
time
dear
high
time
were
all
weary
waiting
for
you
well
thank
god
and
received
her
presents
with
another
customary
remark
not
the
gift
that
precious
dear
but
that
you
give
old
woman
yet
was
evident
that
she
was
not
pleased
pierre
arrival
that
moment
when
diverted
her
attention
from
the
unfinished
game
she
finished
her
game
patience
and
only
then
examined
the
presents
they
consisted
box
for
cards
splendid
workmanship
bright
blue
sevres
tea
cup
with
shepherdesses
depicted
and
with
lid
and
gold
snuffbox
with
the
count
portrait
the
lid
which
pierre
had
had
done
miniaturist
petersburg
the
countess
had
long
wished
for
such
box
but
she
did
not
want
cry
just
then
she
glanced
indifferently
the
portrait
and
gave
her
attention
chiefly
the
box
for
cards
thank
you
dear
you
have
cheered
said
she
she
always
did
but
best
all
you
have
brought
yourself
back
for
never
saw
anything
like
you
ought
give
your
wife
scolding
what
are
with
her
she
like
mad
woman
when
you
are
away
doesn
see
anything
doesn
remember
anything
she
went
repeating
her
usual
phrases
look
anna
timofeevna
she
added
her
companion
see
what
box
for
cards
son
has
brought
belova
admired
the
presents
and
was
delighted
with
her
dress
material
though
pierre
natasha
nicholas
countess
mary
and
denisov
had
much
talk
about
that
they
could
not
discuss
before
the
old
countess
not
that
anything
was
hidden
from
her
but
because
she
had
dropped
far
behindhand
many
things
that
had
they
begun
converse
her
presence
they
would
have
had
answer
inopportune
questions
and
repeat
what
they
had
already
told
her
many
times
that
and
was
dead
and
and
was
married
which
she
would
again
unable
remember
yet
they
sat
tea
round
the
samovar
the
drawing
room
from
habit
and
pierre
answered
the
countess
questions
whether
prince
vasili
had
aged
and
whether
countess
mary
alexeevna
had
sent
greetings
and
still
thought
them
and
other
matters
that
interested
one
and
which
she
herself
was
indifferent
conversation
this
kind
interesting
one
yet
unavoidable
continued
all
through
teatime
all
the
grown
members
the
family
were
assembled
near
the
round
tea
table
which
sonya
presided
beside
the
samovar
the
children
with
their
tutors
and
governesses
had
had
tea
and
their
voices
were
audible
from
the
next
room
tea
all
sat
their
accustomed
places
nicholas
beside
the
stove
small
table
where
his
tea
was
handed
him
milka
the
old
gray
borzoi
bitch
daughter
the
first
milka
with
quite
gray
face
and
large
black
eyes
that
seemed
more
prominent
than
ever
lay
the
armchair
beside
him
denisov
whose
curly
hair
mustache
and
whiskers
had
turned
half
gray
sat
beside
countess
mary
with
his
general
tunic
unbuttoned
pierre
sat
between
his
wife
and
the
old
countess
spoke
what
knew
might
interest
the
old
lady
and
that
she
could
understand
told
her
external
social
events
and
the
people
who
had
formed
the
circle
her
contemporaries
and
had
once
been
real
living
and
distinct
group
but
who
were
now
for
the
most
part
scattered
about
the
world
and
like
herself
were
garnering
the
last
ears
the
harvests
they
had
sown
earlier
years
but
the
old
countess
those
contemporaries
hers
seemed
the
only
serious
and
real
society
natasha
saw
pierre
animation
that
his
visit
had
been
interesting
and
that
had
much
tell
them
but
dare
not
say
before
the
old
countess
denisov
not
being
member
the
family
did
not
understand
pierre
caution
and
being
malcontent
much
interested
what
was
occurring
petersburg
kept
urging
pierre
tell
them
about
what
had
happened
the
semenovsk
regiment
then
about
arakcheev
and
then
about
the
bible
society
once
twice
pierre
was
carried
away
and
began
speak
these
things
but
nicholas
and
natasha
always
brought
him
back
the
health
prince
ivan
and
countess
mary
alexeevna
well
and
all
this
idiocy
gossner
and
tatawinova

what
that
mon
cher
ami
asked
the
countess
who

finished

pretext
for
being
angry
after
her
meal
what

maman

great
influence
they
say
arakcheev

incautiously
remarked

and
how

more
offended
that

remained
silent
she
went
nowadays

and
what
harm
there
that
and
she
rose
everybody
else
got
too
and
with
severe
expression
sailed
back
her
table
the
sitting
room
the
melancholy
silence
that
followed
was
broken
the
sounds
the
children
voices
and
laughter
from
the
next
room
evidently
some
jolly
excitement
was
going
there
finished

above
them
all
pierre
exchanged
glances
with
countess

smiled
happily

rapturously
breathless
cry

filled
the
room

shouted

meant
two

when

added
addressing

the
boy
flushing
crimson
and
looking
pierre
with
bright
ecstatic
eyes

nodded
and
went
with
what

the
children
had
interrupted
countess

sat
down
doing
woolwork
natasha
did
not
take

asked
for
their
pipes
smoked
went
fetch
more
tea
from

sat
weary
but
resolute
the
samovar
and
questioned
pierre
the
curly
headed
delicate
boy
sat
with
shining
eyes
unnoticed
corner
starting
every
now
and
then
and
muttering
something
himself
and
evidently
experiencing
new
and
powerful
emotion
turned
his
curly
head
with
his
thin
neck
exposed
his
turn
down
collar
toward
the
place
where
pierre
sat
the
conversation
turned
the
contemporary
gossip
about
those
power
which
most
people
see
the
chief
interest
home
politics
denisov
dissatisfied
with
the
government
account
his
own
disappointments
the
service
heard
with
pleasure
the
things
done
petersburg
which
seemed
him
stupid
and
made
forcible
and
sharp
comments
what
pierre
told
them
one
used
have
german
now
one
must
dance
with
tatawinova
and
madame
kwudener
and
wead
ecka
tshausen
and
the
bwethwen
they
should
let
that
fine
fellow
bonaparte
loose
knock
all
this
nonsense
out
them
fancy
giving
the
command
the
semenov
wegiment
fellow
like
that
schwa
cried
nicholas
though
free
from
denisov
readiness
find
fault
with
everything
also
thought
that
discussion
the
government
was
very
serious
and
weighty
matter
and
the
fact
that
had
been
appointed
minister
this
and
governor
general
that
and
that
the
emperor
had
said
and
and
this
minister
and
seemed
him
very
important
and
thought
necessary
take
interest
these
things
and
question
pierre
the
questions
put
these
two
kept
the
conversation
from
changing
its
ordinary
character
gossip
about
the
higher
government
circles
but
natasha
knowing
all
her
husband
ways
and
ideas
saw
that
had
long
been
wishing
but
had
been
unable
divert
the
conversation
another
channel
and
express
his
own
deeply
felt
idea
for
the
sake
which
had
gone
petersburg
consult
with
his
new
friend
prince
theodore
and
she
helped
him
asking
how
his
affairs
with
prince
theodore
had
gone
what
was
about
asked
nicholas
always
the
same
thing
said
pierre
looking
round
his
listeners
everybody
sees
that
things
are
going
badly
that
they
cannot
allowed
and
that
the
duty
all
decent
men
counteract
far
they
can
what
can
decent
men
nicholas
inquired
frowning
slightly
what
can
done
why
this
come
into
study
said
nicholas
natasha
who
had
long
expected
fetched
nurse
her
baby
now
heard
the
nurse
calling
her
and
went
the
nursery
countess
mary
followed
her
the
men
went
into
the
study
and
little
nicholas
bolkonski
followed
them
unnoticed
his
uncle
and
sat
down
the
writing
table
shady
corner
the
window
well
what
would
you
asked
denisov
always
some
fantastic
schemes
said
nicholas
why
this
began
pierre
not
sitting
down
but
pacing
the
room
sometimes
stopping
short
gesticulating
and
lisping
the
position
petersburg
this
the
emperor
does
not
look
into
anything
has
abandoned
himself
altogether
this
mysticism
pierre
could
not
tolerate
mysticism
anyone
now
seeks
only
for
peace
and
only
these
people
sans
foi
loi
can
give
him
people
who
recklessly
hack
and
strangle
everything
magnitski
arakcheev
and
tutti
quanti
you
will
agree
that
you
did
not
look
after
your
estates
yourself
but
only
wanted
quiet
life
the
harsher
your
steward
was
the
more
readily
your
object
might
attained
said
nicholas
without
faith
law
well
what
does
that
lead
said
nicholas
well
everything
going
ruin
robbery
the
law
courts
the
army
nothing
but
flogging
drilling
and
military
settlements
the
people
are
tortured
enlightenment
suppressed
all
that
young
and
honest
crushed
everyone
sees
that
this
cannot
everything
strained
such
degree
that
will
certainly
break
said
pierre
those
who
examine
the
actions
any
government
have
always
said
since
governments
began
told
them
just
one
thing
petersburg
told
whom
well
you
know
whom
said
pierre
with
meaning
glance
from
under
his
brows
prince
theodore
and
all
those
encourage
culture
and
philanthropy
all
very
well
course
the
aim
excellent
but
the
present
circumstances
something
else
needed
that
moment
nicholas
noticed
the
presence
his
nephew
his
face
darkened
and
went
the
boy
why
are
you
here
why
let
him
said
pierre
taking
nicholas
the
arm
and
continuing
that
not
enough
told
them
something
else
needed
when
you
stand
expecting
the
overstrained
string
snap
any
moment
when
everyone
expecting
the
inevitable
catastrophe
many
possible
must
join
hands
closely
they
can
withstand
the
general
calamity
everything
that
young
and
strong
being
enticed
away
and
depraved
one
lured
women
another
honors
third
ambition
money
and
they
over
that
camp
independent
men
such
you
are
left
what
say
widen
the
scope
our
society
let
the
mot
ordre
not
virtue
alone
but
independence
and
action
well
nicholas
who
had
left
his
nephew
irritably
pushed
armchair
sat
down
and
listened
pierre
coughing
discontentedly
and
frowning
more
and
more
but
action
with
what
aim
cried
and
what
position
will
you
adopt
toward
the
government
why
the
position
assistants
the
society
need
not
secret
the
government
allows
not
merely
not
hostile
government
but
society
true
conservatives
society
gentlemen
the
full
meaning
that
word
only
prevent
some
pugachev
other
from
killing
children
and
yours
and
arakcheev
from
sending
off
some
military
settlement
join
hands
only
for
the
public
welfare
and
the
general
safety
yes
but
secret
society
and
therefore
hostile
and
harmful
one
which
can
only
cause
harm
why
did
the
tugendbund
which
saved
europe
they
did
not
then
venture
suggest
that
russia
had
saved
europe
any
harm
the
tugendbund
alliance
virtue
love
mutual
help
what
christ
preached
the
cross
natasha
who
had
come
during
the
conversation
looked
joyfully
her
husband
was
not
what
was
saying
that
pleased
her
that
did
not
even
interest
her
for
seemed
her
that
was
all
extremely
simple
and
that
she
had
known
long
time
seemed
her
because
she
knew
that
sprang
from
pierre
whole
soul
but
was
his
animated
and
enthusiastic
appearance
that
made
her
glad
the
boy
with
the
thin
neck
stretching
out
from
the
turn
down
collar
whom
everyone
had
forgotten
gazed
pierre
with
even
greater
and
more
rapturous
joy
every
word
pierre
burned
into
his
heart
and
with
nervous
movement
his
fingers
unconsciously
broke
the
sealing
wax
and
quill
pens
his
hands
came
upon
his
uncle
table
not
all
what
you
suppose
but
that
what
the
german
tugendbund
was
and
what
proposing
fwiend
the
tugendbund
all
vewy
well
for
the
sausage
eaters
but
don
understand
and
can
even
pwonounce
interposed
denisov
loud
and
resolute
voice
agwee
that
evewything
here
wotten
and
howwible
but
the
tugendbund
don
understand
not
satisfied
let
have
bunt
our
own
that
all
wight
suis
vot
homme
your
man
pierre
smiled
natasha
began
laugh
but
nicholas
knitted
his
brows
still
more
and
began
proving
pierre
that
there
was
prospect
any
great
change
and
that
all
the
danger
spoke
existed
only
his
imagination
pierre
maintained
the
contrary
and
his
mental
faculties
were
greater
and
more
resourceful
nicholas
felt
himself
cornered
this
made
him
still
angrier
for
was
fully
convinced
not
reasoning
but
something
within
him
stronger
than
reason
the
justice
his
opinion
will
tell
you
this
said
rising
and
trying
with
nervously
twitching
fingers
prop
his
pipe
corner
but
finally
abandoning
the
attempt
can
prove
you
you
say
that
everything
here
rotten
and
that
overthrow
coming
don
see
but
you
also
say
that
our
oath
allegiance
conditional
matter
and
that
reply
you
are
best
friend
you
know
but
you
formed
secret
society
and
began
working
against
the
government
what
may
know
duty
obey
the
government
and
arakcheev
ordered
lead
squadron
against
you
and
cut
you
down
should
not
hesitate
instant
but
should
and
you
may
argue
about
that
you
like
awkward
silence
followed
these
words
natasha
was
the
first
speak
defending
her
husband
and
attacking
her
brother
her
defense
was
weak
and
inapt
but
she
attained
her
object
the
conversation
was
resumed
and
longer
the
unpleasantly
hostile
tone
nicholas
last
remark
when
they
all
got
supper
little
nicholas
bolkonski
went
pierre
pale
and
with
shining
radiant
eyes
uncle
pierre
you
papa
were
alive
would
agree
with
you
asked
and
pierre
suddenly
realized
what
special
independent
complex
and
powerful
process
thought
and
feeling
must
have
been
going
this
boy
during
that
conversation
and
remembering
all
had
said
regretted
that
the
lad
should
have
heard
him
had
however
give
him
answer
yes
think
said
reluctantly
and
left
the
study
the
lad
looked
down
and
seemed
now
for
the
first
time
notice
what
had
done
the
things
the
table
flushed
and
went
nicholas
uncle
forgive
did
that
unintentionally
said
pointing
the
broken
sealing
wax
and
pens
nicholas
started
angrily
all
right
all
right
said
throwing
the
bits
under
the
table
and
evidently
suppressing
his
vexation
with
difficulty
turned
away
from
the
boy
you
ought
not
have
been
here
all
said
chapter
the
conversation
supper
was
not
about
politics
societies
but
turned
the
subject
nicholas
liked
best
recollections
denisov
started
these
and
pierre
was
particularly
agreeable
and
amusing
about
them
the
family
separated
the
most
friendly
terms
after
supper
nicholas
having
undressed
his
study
and
given
instructions
the
steward
who
had
been
waiting
for
him
went
the
bedroom
his
dressing
gown
where
found
his
wife
still
her
table
writing
what
are
you
writing
mary
nicholas
asked
countess
mary
blushed
she
was
afraid
that
what
she
was
writing
would
not
understood
approved
her
husband
she
had
wanted
conceal
what
she
was
writing
from
him
but
the
same
time
was
glad
had
surprised
her
and
that
she
would
now
have
tell
him
diary
nicholas
she
replied
handing
him
blue
exercise
book
filled
with
her
firm
bold
writing
diary
nicholas
repeated
with
shade
irony
and
took
the
book
was
french
december
today
when
andrusha
her
eldest
boy
woke
did
not
wish
dress
and
mademoiselle
louise
sent
for
was
naughty
and
obstinate
tried
threats
but
only
grew
angrier
then
took
the
matter
hand
left
him
alone
and
began
with
nurse
help
get
the
other
children
telling
him
that
did
not
love
him
for
long
time
was
silent
astonished
then
jumped
out
bed
ran
his
shirt
and
sobbed
that
could
not
calm
him
for
long
time
was
plain
that
what
troubled
him
most
was
that
had
grieved
afterwards
the
evening
when
gave
him
his
ticket
again
began
crying
piteously
and
kissing
one
can
anything
with
him
tenderness
what
ticket
nicholas
inquired
have
begun
giving
the
elder
ones
marks
every
evening
showing
how
they
have
behaved
nicholas
looked
into
the
radiant
eyes
that
were
gazing
him
and
continued
turn
over
the
pages
and
read
the
diary
was
set
down
everything
the
children
lives
that
seemed
noteworthy
their
mother
showing
their
characters
suggesting
general
reflections
educational
methods
they
were
for
the
most
part
quite
insignificant
trifles
but
did
not
seem
the
mother
the
father
either
now
that
read
this
diary
about
his
children
for
the
first
time
under
the
date
was
entered
mitya
was
naughty
table
papa
said
was
have
pudding
had
none
but
looked
unhappily
and
greedily
the
others
while
they
were
eating
think
that
punishment
depriving
children
sweets
only
develops
their
greediness
must
tell
nicholas
this
nicholas
put
down
the
book
and
looked
his
wife
the
radiant
eyes
gazed
him
questioningly
would
approve
disapprove
her
diary
there
could
doubt
not
only
his
approval
but
also
his
admiration
for
his
wife
perhaps
need
not
done
pedantically
thought
nicholas
even
done
all
but
this
untiring
continual
spiritual
effort
which
the
sole
aim
was
the
children
moral
welfare
delighted
him
had
nicholas
been
able
analyze
his
feelings
would
have
found
that
his
steady
tender
and
proud
love
his
wife
rested
his
feeling
wonder
her
spirituality
and
the
lofty
moral
world
almost
beyond
his
reach
which
she
had
her
being
was
proud
her
intelligence
and
goodness
recognized
his
own
insignificance
beside
her
the
spiritual
world
and
rejoiced
all
the
more
that
she
with
such
soul
not
only
belonged
him
but
was
part
himself
quite
quite
approve
dearest
said
with
significant
look
and
after
short
pause
added
and
behaved
badly
today
you
weren
the
study
began
disputing
pierre
and
and
lost
temper
but
impossible

you
any
idea

countess
mary
natasha

you

nicholas
went
growing
hot

mere
recollection
their
discussion
wanted
convince
that
every
honest
man
duty
against
the
government
and
that
the
oath
allegiance
and
duty
sorry
you
weren
there
they
all
fell
denisov
and
natasha
natasha
absurd
how
she
rules
over
him
and
yet
there
need
only
discussion
and
she
has
words
her
own
but
only
repeats
his
sayings
added
nicholas
yielding
that
irresistible
inclination
which
tempts
judge
those
nearest
and
dearest
forgot
that
what
was
saying
about
natasha
could
have
been
applied
word
for
word

his
wife
yes
have
noticed
that
said
countess
mary
when
told
him
that
duty
and
the
oath
were
above
everything
started
proving
goodness

what
pity
you
were
not
there
what
would

have
said

you
were
quite
right
and
told
natasha

corrupted

said
countess
mary
but
forgets
that

other
duties
nearer
duties
indicated
god
himself
and
that
though
might
expose
ourselves
risks
must
not
risk
our
children
yes
that
that
just
what
said
him
put
nicholas
who
fancied
really
had
said
but
they
insisted
their
own
view
love
one
neighbor
and
christianity
and
all
this
the
presence
young
nicholas
who
had
gone
into
study
and
broke
all
things

told
himself

repeated
nicholas
who
heart
was
not
fond
nicholas
bolkonski
but
was
always
anxious

countess

dreadfully
afraid

long
next
summer

petersburg
said
nicholas
yes
pierre
always
was
dreamer
and
always
will
continued
returning
the
talk
the
study
which
had
evidently
disturbed
him
well
what
business
mine
what
goes
there
whether
arakcheev
bad
and
all
that
what
business
was
mine
when
married
and
was
deep
debt
that
was
threatened
with
prison
and
had
mother
who
could
not
see
understand
and
then
there
are
you
and
the
children
and
our
affairs
for
own
pleasure
that
the
farm
the
office
from
morning
night
but
know
must
work
comfort
mother
repay
you
and
not
leave
the
children
such
beggars
was
countess
mary
wanted
tell
him
that
man
does
not
live
bread
alone
and
that
attached
too
much
importance
these
matters
but
she
knew
she
must
not
say
this
and
that
would
useless
she
only
took
his
hand
and
kissed
took
this
sign
approval
and
confirmation
his
thoughts
and
after
few
minutes
reflection
continued
think
aloud
you
know
mary
today
elias
mitrofanych
this
was
his
overseer
came
back
from
the
tambov
estate
and
told
they
are
already
offering
eighty
thousand
rubles
for
the
forest
and
with
eager
face
nicholas
began
speak
the
possibility
repurchasing
otradnoe
before
long
and
added
another
ten
years
life
and
shall
leave
the
children
excellent
position
countess
mary
listened
her
husband
and
understood
all
that
told
her
she
knew
that
when
thought
aloud
this
way
would
sometimes
ask
her
what
had
been
saying
and
vexed
noticed
that
she
had
been
thinking
about
something
else
but
she
had
force
herself
attend
for
what
was
saying
did
not
interest
her
all
she
looked
him
and
did
not
think
but
felt
about
something
different
she
felt
submissive
tender
love
for
this
man
who
would
never
understand
all
that
she
understood
and
this
seemed
make
her
love
for
him
still
stronger
and
added
touch
passionate
tenderness
besides
this
feeling
which
absorbed
her
altogether
and
hindered
her
from
following
the
details
her
husband
plans
thoughts
that
had
connection
with
what
was
saying
flitted
through
her
mind
she
thought
her
nephew
her
husband
account
the
boy
agitation
while
pierre
was
speaking
struck
her
forcibly
and
various
traits
his
gentle
sensitive
character
recurred
her
mind
and
while
thinking
her
nephew
she
thought
also
her
own
children
she
did
not
compare
them
with
him
but
compared
her
feeling
for
them
with
her
feeling
for
him
and
felt
with
regret
that
there
was
something
lacking
her
feeling
for
young
nicholas
sometimes
seemed
her
that
this
difference
arose
from
the
difference
their
ages
but
she
felt
herself
blame
toward
him
and
promised
her
heart
better
and
accomplish
the
impossible
this
life
love
her
husband
her
children
little
nicholas
and
all
her
neighbors
christ
loved
mankind
countess
mary
soul
always
strove
toward
the
infinite
the
eternal
and
the
absolute
and
could
therefore
never
peace
stern
expression
the
lofty
secret
suffering
soul
burdened
the
body
appeared
her
face
nicholas
gazed
her
god
what
will
become
she
dies

when
her
face

that
thought
and
placing
himself
before

chapter
xvi
natasha
and
pierre
left
alone
also
began
talk
only
husband
and
wife
can
talk
that
with
extraordinary
clearness
and
rapidity
understanding
and
expressing
each
other
thoughts
ways
contrary
all
rules
logic
without
premises
deductions
conclusions
and
quite
peculiar
way
natasha
was
used
this
kind
talk
with
her
husband
that
for
her
was
the
surest
sign
something
being
wrong
between
them
pierre
followed
line
logical
reasoning
when
began
proving
anything
talking
argumentatively
and
calmly
and
she
led
his
example
began
the
same
she
knew
that
they
were
the
verge
quarrel
from
the
moment
they
were
alone
and
natasha
came
him
with
wide
open
happy
eyes
and
quickly
seizing
his
head
pressed
her
bosom
saying
now
you
are
all
mine
mine
you
won
escape
from
that
moment
this
conversation
began
contrary
all
the
laws
logic
and
contrary
them
because
quite
different
subjects
were
talked
about
one
and
the
same
time
this
simultaneous
discussion
many
topics
did
not
prevent
clear
understanding
but
the
contrary
was
the
surest
sign
that
they
fully
understood
one
another
just
dream
when
all
uncertain
unreasoning
and
contradictory
except
the
feeling
that
guides
the
dream
this
intercourse
contrary
all
laws
reason
the
words
themselves
were
not
consecutive
and
clear
but
only
the
feeling
that
prompted
them
natasha
spoke
pierre
about
her
brother
life
and
doings
how
she
had
suffered
and
lacked
life
during
his
own
absence
and
how
she
was
fonder
than
ever
mary
and
how
mary
was
every
way
better
than
herself
saying
this
natasha
was
sincere
acknowledging
mary
superiority
but
the
same
time
saying
she
made
demand
pierre
that
should
all
the
same
prefer
her
mary
and
all
other
women
and
that
now
especially
after
having
seen
many
women
petersburg
should
tell
her
afresh
pierre
answering
natasha
words
told
her
how
intolerable
had
been
for
him
meet
ladies
dinners
and
balls
petersburg
have
quite
lost
the
knack
talking
ladies
said
was
simply
dull
besides
was
very
busy
natasha
looked
intently
him
and
went
mary
splendid
she
said
how
she
understands
children
she
saw
straight
into
their
souls
yesterday
for
instance
mitya
was
naughty
how
like
his
father
pierre
interjected
natasha
knew
why
mentioned
mitya
likeness
nicholas
the
recollection
his
dispute
with
his
brother
law
was
unpleasant
and
wanted
know
what
natasha
thought
nicholas
has
the
weakness
never
agreeing
with
anything
not
generally
accepted
but
understand
that
you
value
what
opens
fresh
line
said
she
repeating
words
pierre
had
once
uttered
the
chief
point
that
nicholas
ideas
and
discussions
are
amusement
almost
pastime
said
pierre
for
instance
collecting
library
and
has
made
rule
not
buy
new
book
till
has
read
what
had
already
bought
sismondi
and
rousseau
and
montesquieu
added
with
smile
you
know
how
much
began
soften
down
what
had
said
but
natasha
interrupted
him
show
that
this
was
unnecessary
you
say
ideas
are
amusement
him
yes
and
for
nothing
else
serious
all
the
time
petersburg
saw
everyone
dream
when
taken
thought
all
else
mere
amusement
sorry
wasn
there
when
you
met
the
children
said
natasha
which
was
most
delighted
lisa
sure
yes
pierre
replied
and
went
with
what
was
his
mind
nicholas
says
ought
not
think
but
can
help
besides
when
was
petersburg
felt
can
say
this
you
that
the
whole
affair
would
pieces
without
everyone
was
pulling
his
own
way
but
succeeded
uniting
them
all
and
then
idea
clear
and
simple
you
see
don
say
that
ought
oppose
this
and
that
may
mistaken
what
say
join
hands
you
who
love
the
right
and
let
there
but
one
banner
that
active
virtue
prince
sergey
fine
fellow
and
clever
natasha
would
have
had
doubt
the
greatness
pierre
idea
but
one
thing
disconcerted
her
can
man
important
and
necessary
society
also
husband
how
did
this
happen
she
wished
express
this
doubt
him
now
who
could
decide
whether
really
cleverer
than
all
the
others
she
asked
herself
and
passed
review
all
those
whom
pierre
most
respected
judging
what
had
said
there
was
one
had
respected
highly
platon
karataev
you
know
what
thinking
about
she
asked
about
platon
karataev
would
have
approved
you
now
you
think
pierre
was
not
all
surprised
this
question
understood
his
wife
line
thought
platon
karataev
repeated
and
pondered
evidently
sincerely
trying
imagine
karataev
opinion
the
subject
would
not
have
understood
yet
perhaps
would
love
you
awfully
natasha
suddenly
said
awfully
awfully
would
not
have
approved
said
pierre
after
reflection
what
would
have
approved
our
family
life
was
always
anxious
find
seemliness
happiness
and
peace
everything
and
should
have
been
proud
let
him
see
there
now
you
talk
absence
but
you
wouldn
believe
what
special
feeling
have
for
you
after
separation
yes
should
think
natasha
began
not
that
never
leave
off
loving
you
and
one
couldn
love
more
but
this
something
special
yes
course
did
not
finish
because
their
eyes
meeting
said
the
rest
what
nonsense
natasha
suddenly
exclaimed
about
honeymoons
and
that
the
greatest
happiness
first
the
contrary
now
the
best
all
only
you
did
not
away
you
remember
how
quarreled
and
was
always
fault
always
mine
and
what
quarreled
about
don
even
remember
always
about
the
same
thing
said
pierre
with
smile
jealo
don
say
can
bear
natasha
cried
and
her
eyes
glittered
coldly
and
vindictively
did
you
see
her
she
added
after
pause
and
had
shouldn
have
recognized
her
they
were
silent
for
while
you
know
while
you
were
talking
the
study
was
looking
you
natasha
began
evidently
anxious
disperse
the
cloud
that
had
come
over
them
you
are
like
him
two
peas
like
the
boy
she
meant
her
little
son
time
him
the
milk
come
but
sorry
leave
you
they
were
silent
for
few
seconds
then
suddenly
turning
one
another
the
same
time
they
both
began
speak
pierre
began
with
self
satisfaction
and
enthusiasm
natasha
with
quiet
happy
smile
having
interrupted
one
another
they
both
stopped
let
the
other
continue
what
did
you
say
you
was
talking
nonsense
said
natasha
pierre
finished
what
had
begun
was
the
sequel
his
complacent
reflections
his
success
petersburg
that
moment
seemed
him
that
was
chosen
give
new
direction
the
whole
russian
society
and
the
whole
world
only
wished
say
that
ideas
that
have
great
results
are
always
simple
ones
whole
idea
that
vicious
people
are
united
and
constitute
power
then
honest
folk
must
the
same
now
that
simple
enough
yes
and
what
were
you
going
say
only
nonsense
but
all
the
same
nothing
only
trifle
said
natasha
smilingly
still
more
brightly
only
wanted
tell
you
about
petya
today
nurse
was
coming
take
him
from
and
laughed
shut
his
eyes
and
clung
sure
thought
was
hiding
awfully
sweet
there
now
crying
well
good
and
she
left
the
room
meanwhile
downstairs
young
nicholas
bolkonski
bedroom
little
lamp
was
burning
usual
the
boy
was
afraid
the
dark
and
they
could
not
cure
him
dessalles
slept
propped
four
pillows
and
his
roman
nose
emitted
sounds
rhythmic
snoring
little
nicholas
who
had
just
waked
cold
perspiration
sat
bed
and
gazed
before
him
with
wide
open
eyes
had
awaked
from
terrible
dream
had
dreamed
that
and
uncle
pierre
wearing
helmets
such
were
depicted
his
plutarch
were
leading
huge
army
the
army
was
made
white
slanting
lines
that
filled
the
air
like
the
cobwebs
that
float
about
autumn
and
which
dessalles
called
les
fils
vierge
front
was
glory
which
was
similar
those
threads
but
rather
thicker
and
pierre
were
borne
along
lightly
and
joyously
nearer
and
nearer
their
goal
suddenly
the
threads
that
moved
them
began
slacken
and
become
entangled
and
grew
difficult
move
and
uncle
nicholas
stood
before
them
stern
and
threatening
attitude
have
you
done
this
said
pointing
some
broken
sealing
wax
and
pens
loved
you
but
have
orders
from
arakcheev
and
will
kill
the
first

who
moves
forward
little
nicholas
turned
look
pierre
but
pierre
was
longer
there
his
place
was
his
father
prince
andrew
and
his
father
had
neither
shape
nor
form
but
existed
and
when
little
nicholas
perceived
him
grew
faint
with
love
felt
himself
powerless
limp
and
formless
his
father
caressed
and
pitied
him
but
uncle
nicholas
came
nearer
and
nearer
them
terror
seized
young
nicholas
and
awoke
father
thought
though
there
were
two
good
portraits
prince
andrew
the

nicholas
never
imagined
him

mucius

with
and
suddenly
his
bosom
heaved
with
sobs
and
began
cry

nicholas
and
lay
back
his
pillow
good
and
kind
and
fond

the

humanity
even

appears
impossible
the
ancient

all
employed
one
and
the

method
describe
and
seize
the
apparently
elusive
the

they
described
the

individuals
who
ruled
the

and
regarded
the

those

representing
the

the
question
how
did
individuals
make
nations
act
they
wished
and
what
was
the
will
these
individuals
themselves
guided
the

met
recognizing

subjected
the
nations
the

chosen
man
and
guided
the
will
that
chosen
man
accomplish
ends
that
were
predestined
for
the
ancients
these
questions
were
solved
belief
the
direct
participation
the
deity
human
affairs
modern
history
theory
rejects
both
these
principles
would
seem
that
having
rejected
the
belief
the
ancients
man
subjection
the

and
predetermined
aim
toward
which
nations
are
led
modern
history
should
study
not
the
manifestations
power
but
the
causes
that
produce
but
modern
history
has
not
done
this
having
theory
rejected
the
view
held
the

still

instead

endowed
with

authority

has

its

abstraction
the
welfare
and
civilization
humanity
general
which
usually
meant
that
the

occupying

modern
history
has
rejected
the
beliefs
the

without
replacing
them
new
conception
and
the
logic
the
situation
has
obliged
the
historians
after
they
had
apparently
rejected
the
divine
authority
the
kings
and
the
fate
the

reach
the
same
conclusion
another
road
that
recognize

and
the

aim
which
these

the
works
all
the
modern
historians
from
gibbon
buckle
despite
their
seeming
disagreements
and
the
apparent
novelty
their
outlooks
lie
those
two
old
unavoidable
assumptions
the
first
place
the
historian
describes
the
activity
individuals
who
his
opinion
have
directed
humanity
one
historian
considers
only
monarchs

these
are
the
instinctive
plain

legitimate
questions
humanity
asks
itself
when
encounters
the
monuments
and

period
for
reply
these
questions
the
common
sense
mankind
turns
the
science
history
whose
aim
enable
nations
and
humanity
know
themselves
history
had
retained
the
conception
the
ancients
would
have
said
that
god
reward
punish
his
people
gave
napoleon
power
and
directed
his
will
the
fulfillment
the
divine
ends
and
that
reply
would
have
been
clear
and
complete
one
might
believe
disbelieve
the
divine
significance
napoleon
but
for
anyone
believing
there
would
have
been
nothing
unintelligible
the
history
that
period
nor
would
there
have
been
any
contradictions
but
modern
history
cannot
give
that
reply
science
does
not
admit
the
conception
the
ancients
the
direct
participation
the
deity
human
affairs
and
therefore
history
ought
give
other
answers
modern
history
replying
these
questions
says
you
want
know
what
this
movement
means
what
caused
and
what
force
produced
these
events
then
listen
louis
xiv
was
very
proud
and
self
confident
man
had
such
and
such
mistresses
and
such
and
such
ministers
and
ruled
france
badly
his
descendants
were
weak
men
and
they
too
ruled
france
badly
and
they
had
such
and
such
favorites
and
such
and
such
mistresses
moreover
certain
men
wrote
some
books
that
time
the
end
the
eighteenth
century
there
were
couple
dozen
men
paris
who
began
talk
about
all
men
being
free
and
equal
this
caused
people
all
over
france
begin
slash
and
drown
one
another
they
killed
the
king
and
many
other
people
that
time
there
was
france
man
genius
napoleon
conquered
everybody
everywhere
that
killed
many
people
because
was
great
genius
and
for
some
reason
went
kill
africans
and
killed
them
well
and
was
cunning
and
wise
that
when
returned
france
ordered
everybody
obey
him
and
they
all
obeyed
him
having
become
emperor
again
went
out
kill
people
italy
austria
and
prussia
and
there
too
killed
great
many
russia
there
was
emperor
alexander
who
decided
restore
order
europe
and
therefore
fought
against
napoleon
suddenly
made
friends
with
him
but
they
again
quarreled
and
again
began
killing
many
people
napoleon
led
six
hundred
thousand
men
into
russia
and
captured
moscow
then
suddenly
ran
away
from
moscow
and
the
emperor
alexander
helped
the
advice
stein
and
others
united
europe
arm
against
the
disturber
its
peace
all
napoleon
allies
suddenly
became
his
enemies
and
their
forces
advanced
against
the
fresh
forces
raised
the
allies
defeated
napoleon
entered
paris
forced
napoleon
abdicate
and
sent
him
the
island
elba
not
depriving
him
the
title
emperor
and
showing
him
every
respect
though
five
years
before
and
one
year
later
they
all
regarded
him
outlaw
and
brigand
then
louis
xviii
who
till
then
had
been
the
laughingstock
both
the
french
and
the
allies
began
reign
and
napoleon
shedding
tears
before
his
old
guards
renounced
the
throne
and
went
into
exile
then
the
skillful
statesmen
and
diplomatists
especially
talleyrand
who
managed
sit
down
particular
chair
before
anyone
else
and
thereby
extended
the
frontiers
france
talked
vienna
and
these
conversations
made
the
nations
happy
unhappy
suddenly
the
diplomatists
and
monarchs
nearly
quarreled
and
were
the
point
again
ordering
their
armies
kill
one
another
but
just
then
napoleon
arrived
france
with
battalion
and
the
french
who
had
been
hating
him
immediately
all
submitted
him
but
the
allied
monarchs
were
angry
this
and
went
fight
the
french
once
more
and
they
defeated
the
genius
napoleon
and
suddenly
recognizing
him
brigand
sent
him
the
island
helena
and
the
exile
separated
from
the
beloved
france
dear
his
heart
died
lingering
death
that
rock
and
bequeathed
his
great
deeds
posterity
but
europe
reaction
occurred
and
the
sovereigns
once
again
all
began
oppress
their

would
mistake
think
that
this
ironic
caricature
the
historical
accounts
the
contrary
very
mild
expression
the
contradictory
replies
not
meeting
the
questions
which
all
the

give
from
the

memoirs
and
the

separate
states
the
writers
general
histories
and
the
new
histories
the
culture
that
period
the
strangeness
and
absurdity
these
replies
arise
from
the
fact
that
modern
history
like
deaf
man
answers
questions
one
has
asked
the
purpose
history
give
description
the
movement
humanity
and
the
peoples
the
first
question
the
absence
reply
which
all
the
rest
will
incomprehensible
what
the
power
that
moves
peoples
this
modern
history
laboriously
replies
either
that
napoleon
was
great
genius
that
louis
xiv
was
very
proud
that
certain
writers
wrote
certain
books
all
that
may
and
mankind
ready
agree
with
but
not
what
was
asked
all
that
would
interesting
recognized
divine
power
based
itself
and
always
consistently
directing
its
nations
through
napoleons
louis
and
writers
but
not
acknowledge
such
power
and
therefore
before
speaking
about
napoleons
louis
and
authors
ought
shown
the
connection
existing
between
these
men
and
the
movement
the
nations
instead
divine
power
some
other
force
has
appeared
should
explained
what
this
new
force
consists
for
the
whole
interest
history
lies
precisely
that
force
history
seems
assume
that
this
force
self
evident
and
known
everyone
but
spite
every
desire
regard
known
anyone
reading
many
historical
works
cannot
help
doubting
whether
this
new
force
variously
understood
the
historians
themselves
really
quite
well
known
everybody
chapter
what
force
moves
the
nations
biographical
historians
and
historians
separate
nations
understand
this
force
power
inherent
heroes
and
rulers
their
narration
events
occur
solely
the
will
napoleon
and
alexander
general
the
persons
they
describe
the
answers
given
this
kind
historian
the
question
what
force
causes
events
happen
are
satisfactory
only
long
there
but
one
historian
each
event
soon
historians
different
nationalities
and
tendencies
begin
describe
the
same
event
the
replies
they
give
immediately
lose
all
meaning
for
this
force
understood
them
all
not
only
differently
but
often
quite
contradictory
ways
one
historian
says
that
event
was
produced
napoleon
power
another
that
was
produced
alexander
third
that
was
due
the
power
some
other
person
besides
this
historians
that
kind
contradict
each
other
even
their
statement
the
force
which
the
authority
some
particular
person
was
based
thiers
bonapartist
says
that
napoleon
power
was
based
his
virtue
and
genius
lanfrey
republican
says
was
based
his
trickery
and
deception
the
people
the
historians
this
class
mutually
destroying
one
another
positions
destroy
the
understanding
the
force
which
produces
events
and
furnish
reply
history
essential
question
writers
universal
history
who
deal
with
all
the
nations
seem
recognize
how
erroneous
the
specialist
historians
view
the
force
which
produces
events
they
not
recognize
power
inherent
heroes
and
rulers
but
the
resultant
multiplicity
variously
directed
forces
describing
war
the
subjugation
people
general
historian
looks
for
the
cause
the
event
not
the
power
one
man
but
the
interaction
many
persons
connected
with
the
event
according
this
view
the
power
historical
personages
represented
the
product
many
forces
can
longer
would
seem
regarded
force
that
itself
produces
events
yet
most
cases
universal
historians
still
employ
the
conception
power
force
that
itself
produces
events
and
treat
their
cause
their
exposition
historic
character
first
the
product
his
time
and
his
power
only
the
resultant
various
forces
and
then
his
power
itself
force
producing
events
gervinus
schlosser
and
others
for
instance
one
time
prove
napoleon
product
the
revolution
the
ideas
and
forth
and
another
plainly
say
that
the
campaign
and
other
things
they
not
like
were
simply
the
product
napoleon
misdirected
will
and
that
the
very
ideas
were
arrested
their
development
napoleon
caprice
the
ideas
the
revolution
and
the
general
temper
the
age
produced
napoleon
power
but
napoleon
power
suppressed
the
ideas
the
revolution
and
the
general
temper
the
age
this
curious
contradiction
not
accidental
not
only
does
occur
every
step
but
the
universal
historians
accounts
are
all
made
chain
such
contradictions
this
contradiction
occurs
because
after
entering
the
field
analysis
the
universal
historians
stop
halfway
find
component
forces
equal
the
composite
resultant
force
the
sum
the
components
must
equal
the
resultant
this
condition
never
observed
the
universal
historians
and
explain
the
resultant
forces
they
are
obliged
admit
addition
the
insufficient
components
another
unexplained
force
affecting
the
resultant
action
specialist
historians
describing
the
campaign
the
restoration
the
bourbons
plainly
assert
that
these
events
were
produced
the
will
alexander
but
the
universal
historian
gervinus
refuting
this
opinion
the
specialist
historian
tries
prove
that
the
campaign
and
the
restoration
the
bourbons
were
due
other
things
beside
alexander
will
such
the
activity
stein
metternich
madame
stael
talleyrand
fichte
chateaubriand
and
others
the
historian
evidently
decomposes
alexander
power
into
the
components
talleyrand
chateaubriand
and
the
rest
but
the
sum
the
components
that
the
interactions
chateaubriand
talleyrand
madame
stael
and
the
others
evidently
does
not
equal
the
resultant
namely
the
phenomenon
millions
frenchmen
submitting
the
bourbons
that
chateaubriand
madame
stael
and
others
spoke
certain
words
one
another
only
affected
their
mutual
relations
but
does
not
account
for
the
submission
millions
and
therefore
explain
how
from
these
relations
theirs
the
submission
millions
people
resulted
that
how
component
forces
equal
one
gave
resultant
equal
thousand
times
the
historian
again
obliged
fall
back
power
the
force
had
denied
and
recognize
the
resultant
the
forces
that
has
admit
unexplained
force
acting
the
resultant
and
that
just
what
the
universal
historians
and
consequently
they
not
only
contradict
the
specialist
historians
but
contradict
themselves

the

and
the

way
the
universal

sometimes
when
pleases
them
and
fits
with
their
theory
say
that
power
the
result
events
and
sometimes
when
they
want
prove
something
else
say
that

produces

third

following
the
path
laid
down
the
universal
historians
who
sometimes
accept
writers
and
ladies
forces
producing

again
take
that
force
something
quite
different
they
see
what

mental

the
historians

are
quite
consistent
regard
their
progenitors
the
writers
universal

for
historical
events
may
explained
the
fact
that
certain
persons
treated
one
another
such
and
such
ways
why
not
explain
them
the
fact
that
such
and
such
people
wrote
such
and
such
books
the
immense
number
indications
accompanying
every
vital
phenomenon
these
historians
select
the
indication
intellectual

and
say
that
this
indication
the
cause
but
despite
their
endeavors
prove
that
the
cause
events
lies
intellectual

only
great
stretch
can
one
admit
that
there
any
connection
between
intellectual
activity
and
the
movement
peoples
and
case
can
one
admit
that
intellectual
activity
controls
people
actions
for
that
view
not
confirmed
such
facts
the
very
cruel
murders
the
french
revolution
resulting
from
the
doctrine
the
equality
man
the
very
cruel
wars
and
executions
resulting
from
the
preaching
love
but
even
admitting
correct
all
the
cunningly
devised
arguments
with
which
these
histories
are
filled
admitting
that
nations
are
governed
some
undefined
force
called
idea
history
essential
question
still
remains
unanswered
and
the
former
power
monarchs
and
the

advisers
and
other
people
introduced
the
universal
historians
another
newer
force
the
idea
added
the
connection
which
with
the
masses
needs
explanation
possible
understand
that
napoleon
had
power
and
events
occurred
with
some
effort
one
may
even
conceive
that
napoleon
together
with
other
influences
was
the
cause
event
but
how
book
contrat
social
had
the
effect
making
frenchmen
begin
drown
one
another
cannot
understood
without
explanation
the
causal
nexus
this
new
force
with
the
event
undoubtedly
some
relation
exists
between
all
who
live
contemporaneously
and
possible
find
some
connection
between
the
intellectual
activity
men
and
their
historical
movements
just
such
connection
may
found
between
the
movements
humanity
and
commerce
handicraft
gardening
anything
else
you
please
but
why
intellectual
activity
considered
the
historians
culture
the
cause
expression
the
whole
historical
movement
hard
understand
only
the
following
considerations
can
have
led
the
historians
such
conclusion
that
history
written
learned
men
and
natural
and
agreeable
for
them
think
that
the
activity
their
class
supplies
the
basis
the
movement
all
humanity
just
similar
belief
natural
and
agreeable
traders
agriculturists
and
soldiers
they
not
express
that
merely
because
traders
and
soldiers
not
write
history
and
that
spiritual
activity
enlightenment
civilization
culture
ideas
are
all
indistinct
indefinite
conceptions
under
whose
banner
very
easy
use
words
having
still
less
definite
meaning
and
which
can
therefore
readily
introduced
into
any
theory
but
not
speak
the
intrinsic
quality
histories
this
kind
which
may
possibly
even
use
someone
for
something
the
histories
culture
which
all
general
histories
tend
more
and
more
approximate
are
significant
from
the
fact
that
after
seriously
and
minutely
examining
various
religious
philosophic
and
political
doctrines
causes
events
soon
they
have
describe
actual
historic
event
such
the
campaign
for
instance
they
involuntarily
describe
resulting
from
exercise
power
and
say
plainly
that
that
was
the
result
napoleon
will
speaking
the
historians
culture
involuntarily
contradict
themselves
and
show
that
the
new
force
they
have
devised
does
not
account
for
what
happens
history
and
that
history
can
only
explained
introducing
power
which
they
apparently
not
recognize

the
science
jurisprudence
regards
the
state
and
power
the
ancients
regarded
fire
namely
something
existing
absolutely
but
for
history
the
state
and
power
are
merely
phenomena
just
for
modern
physics
fire
not
element
but
phenomenon
from
this
fundamental
difference
between
the
view
held
history
and
that
held
jurisprudence
follows
that
jurisprudence
can
tell
minutely
how
its
opinion
power
should
constituted
and
what
power
existing
immutably
outside
time
but
history
questions
about
the
meaning
the
mutations
power
time
can
answer
nothing
power
the
collective
will
the
people
transferred
their
ruler
was
pugachev
representative
the
will
the
people
not
then
why
was
napoleon
why
was
napoleon
iii
criminal
when
was
taken
prisoner
boulogne
and
why
later
were
those
criminals
whom
arrested
palace
revolutions
which
sometimes
only
two
three
people
take
part
transfer
the
will
the
people
new
ruler
international
relations
the
will
the
people
also
transferred
their
conqueror
was
the
will
the
confederation
the
rhine
transferred
napoleon
was
the
will
the
russian
people
transferred
napoleon
when
our
army
alliance
with
the
french
went
fight
the
austrians
these
questions
three
answers
are
possible
either
assume
that
the
will
the
people
always
unconditionally
transferred
the
ruler
rulers
they
have
chosen
and
that
therefore
every
emergence
new
power
every
struggle
against
the
power
once
appointed
should
absolutely
regarded
infringement
the
real
power
that
the
will
the
people
transferred
the
rulers
conditionally
under
definite
and
known
conditions
and
show
that
all
limitations
conflicts
and
even
destructions
power
result
from
nonobservance
the
rulers
the
conditions
under
which
their
power
was
entrusted
them
that
the
will
the
people
delegated
the
rulers
conditionally
but
that
the
conditions
are
unknown
and
indefinite
and
that
the
appearance
several
authorities
their
struggles
and
their
falls
result
solely
from
the
greater
lesser
fulfillment
the
rulers
these
unknown
conditions
which
the
will
the
people
transferred
from
some
people
others
and
these
are
the
three
ways
which
the
historians
explain
the
relation
the
people
their
rulers
some
historians
those
biographical
and
specialist
historians
already
referred
their
simplicity
failing
understand
the
question
the
meaning
power
seem
consider
that
the
collective
will
the
people
unconditionally
transferred
historical
persons
and
therefore
when
describing
some
single
state
they
assume
that
particular
power
the
one
absolute
and
real
power
and
that
any
other
force
opposing
this
not
power
but
violation
power
mere
violence
their
theory
suitable
for
primitive
and
peaceful
periods
history
has
the
inconvenience
application
complex
and
stormy
periods
the
life
nations
during
which
various
powers
arise
simultaneously
and
struggle
with
one
another
that
legitimist
historian
will
prove
that
the
national
convention
the
directory
and
bonaparte
were
mere
infringers
the
true
power
while
republican
and
bonapartist
will
prove
the
one
that
the
convention
and
the
other
that
the
empire
was
the
real
power
and
that
all
the
others
were
violations
power
evidently
the
explanations
furnished
these
historians
being
mutually
contradictory
can
only
satisfy
young
children
recognizing
the
falsity
this
view
history
another
set
historians
say
that
power
rests
conditional
delegation
the
will
the
people
their
rulers
and
that
historical
leaders
have
power
only
conditionally
carrying
out
the
program
that
the
will
the
people
has
tacit
agreement
prescribed
them
but
what
this
program
consists
these
historians
not
say
they
they
continually
contradict
one
another
each
historian
according
his
view
what
constitutes
nation
progress
looks
for
these
conditions
the
greatness
wealth
freedom
enlightenment
citizens
france
some
other
country
but
not
mention
the
historians
contradictions
the
nature
this
program
even
admitting
that
some
one
general
program
these
conditions
exists
the
facts
history
almost
always
contradict
that
theory
the
conditions
under
which
power
entrusted
consist
the
wealth
freedom
and
enlightenment
the
people
how
that
louis
xiv
and
ivan
the
terrible
end
their
reigns
tranquilly
while
louis
xvi
and
charles
are
executed
their
people
this
question
historians
reply
that
louis
xiv
activity
contrary
the
program
reacted
louis
xvi
but
why
did
not
react
louis
xiv
louis
why
should
react
just
louis
xvi
and
what
the
time
limit
for
such
reactions
these
questions
there
are
and
can
answers
equally
little
does
this
view
explain
why
for
several
centuries
the
collective
will
not
withdrawn
from
certain
rulers
and
their
heirs
and
then
suddenly
during
period
fifty
years
transferred
the
convention
the
directory
napoleon
alexander
louis
xviii
napoleon
again
charles
louis
philippe
republican

and
napoleon
iii
when
explaining
these
rapid
transfers
the
people
will
from
one
individual
another
especially
view
international
relations
conquests
and
alliances
the
historians
are
obliged
admit
that
some
these
transfers
are
not
normal
delegations
the
people
will
but
are
accidents
dependent
cunning
mistakes
craft
the
weakness
diplomatist
ruler
party
leader
that
the
greater
part
the
events
history
civil
wars
revolutions
and
conquests
are
presented
these
historians
not
the
results
free
transferences
the
people
will
but
results
the
ill
directed
will
one
more
individuals
that
once
again
usurpations
power
and
these
historians
also
see
and
admit
historical
events
which
are
exceptions
the
theory
these
historians
resemble
botanist
who
having
noticed
that
some
plants
grow
from
seeds
producing
two
cotyledons
should
insist
that
all
that
grows
does
sprouting
into
two
leaves
and
that
the
palm
the
mushroom
and
even
the
oak
which
blossom
into
full
growth
and
longer
resemble
two
leaves
are
deviations
from
the
theory
historians
the
third
class
assume
that
the
will
the
people
transferred
historic
personages
conditionally
but
that
the
conditions
are
unknown
they
say
that
historical
personages
have
power
only
because
they
fulfill
the
will
the
people
which
has
been
delegated
them
but
that
case
the
force
that
moves
nations
lies
not
the
historic
leaders
but
the
nations
themselves
what
significance
have
those
leaders
the
leaders
these
historians
tell
express
the
will
the
people
the
activity
the
leaders
represents
the
activity
the
people
but
that
case
the
question
arises
whether
all
the
activity
the
leaders
serves
expression
the
people
will
only
some
part
the
whole
activity
the
leaders
serves
the
expression
the
people
will
some
historians
suppose
then
all
the
details
the
court
scandals
contained
the
biographies
napoleon
catherine
serve
express
the
life
the
nation
which
evident
nonsense
but
only
some
particular
side
the
activity
historical
leader
which
serves
express
the
people
life
other
called
philosophical
historians
believe
then
determine
which
side
the
activity
leader
expresses
the
nation
life
have
first
all
know
what
the
nation
life
consists
met
this
difficulty
historians
that
class
devise
some
most
obscure
impalpable
and
general
abstraction
which
can
cover
all
conceivable
occurrences
and
declare
this
abstraction
the
aim
humanity
movement
the
most
usual
generalizations
adopted
almost
all
the
historians
are
freedom
equality
enlightenment
progress
civilization
and
culture
postulating
some
generalization
the
goal
the
movement
humanity
the
historians
study
the
men
whom
the
greatest
number
monuments
have
remained
kings
ministers
generals
authors
reformers
popes
and
journalists
the
extent
which
their
opinion
these
persons
have
promoted
hindered
that
abstraction
but
way
proved
that
the
aim
humanity
does
consist
freedom
equality
enlightenment
civilization
and
the
connection
the
people
with
the
rulers
and
enlighteners
humanity
only
based
the
arbitrary
assumption
that
the
collective
will
the
people
always
transferred
the
men

have
noticed
happens
that
the
activity
the
millions
who
migrate
burn
houses
abandon
agriculture
and
destroy
one
another
never
expressed
the
account
the
activity

dozen

did
not

history

its
application
history
soon
revolutions

occur
that
soon

begins
that
theory

nothing
the
theory
seems
irrefutable
just
because

never

whoever
may
stand

the

can
always
say
that
such
and
such
person
took
the
lead
because
the

was

him
the
replies
this
theory
gives
historical
questions
are

the

cattle
and
paying
attention
the
varying
quality
the

the

goes
that
direction
because
the

front
leads
and
the

this
what
historians
the
first
class
say
those
who
assume
the
unconditional
transference
the
people
will
the
animals
leading
the
herd
change
this
happens
because
the
collective
will
all
the
animals
transferred
from
one
leader
another
according
whether
the
animal
not
leading
them
the
direction
selected
the
whole

such
the
reply
historians
who
assume
that
the

the
people
delegated
rulers
under
conditions
which
they
regard

with
this
method

often

because

the

phrases
about

shows
that
these

have

are
all
contradictory

these

have
very
necessary
significance
their

these
justifications
release
those

from
moral

there
would
reply
the
simplest
question
that
presents
itself
when
examining
each
historical
event
how
that
millions
men
commit
collective
crimes
make
war
commit
murder
and
with
the
present
complex
forms

europe
can
any
event
that
not

imagined
there
any
collective
action
which
cannot
find
its
justification
political
unity

that
every
event
that
occurs
inevitably
coincides
with
some
expressed
wish
and
receiving
justification

itself

that

the

wherever

always

the

historical

examining

the

found
that

the

the

who
participate
the

who
always
combine
such
way
that

the

someone

mankind

this
relation
between

all
cases
without
exception
which
our
conception
freedom
and

increased
and
diminished
depend
three
considerations
the
relation
the
external
world
the
man
who
commits
the
deeds
his
relation
time
his
relation
the
causes
leading
the
action
the
first
consideration
the
clearness
our
perception
the
man
relation
the
external

and
the
greater
lesser
clearness
our
understanding
the
definite
position
occupied
the
man
relation
everything
coexisting
with
him
this
what
makes
evident
that
drowning
man
less
free
and
more
subject
necessity
than
one
standing
dry
ground
and
that
makes
the
actions
man
closely
connected

others
thickly
populated
district

bound
family

seem
certainly
less
free
and
more

necessity
than
those
man
living
solitude
and

consider
man
alone
apart
from
his
relation
everything
around
him
each
action
his
seems
free
but
see
his
relation
anything
around
him
see
his
connection
with
anything
whatever
with

who
speaks
him
book
reads
the
work
which
engaged
even
with
the
air
breathes
the
light
that
falls
the
things
about
him
see
that
each
these
circumstances
has
influence
him
and
controls
least
some
side
his
activity
and
the
more
perceive
these
influences
the
more
our
conception
his
freedom
diminishes
and
the
more
our
conception
the
necessity
that
weighs
him
increases
the
second
consideration
the
more
less
evident
time
relation
the
man
the
world
and
the
clearness
our
perception
the
place
the
man
action
occupies
time
that
the
ground
which
makes
the
fall
the
first
man
resulting
the
production
the
human
race
appear
evidently
less
free
than
man
entry

today
the
reason
why
the
life
and
activity
people
who
lived
centuries
ago
and
are
connected
with
time
cannot
seem
free
the
life
contemporary
the
consequences
which
are
still
unknown
the
degree
our
conception
freedom
inevitability
depends
this
respect
the
greater
lesser
lapse
time
between
the
performance
the
action
and
our
judgment
examine
act
performed
moment

approximately
the
same
circumstances
those
now
action
appears
undoubtedly
free
but
examine

then
being

cannot
help
recognizing
that
that

not
been
committed
much
that

from

not
have

then
the

its

prevent
our
considering

the

the

these

alone
based
the
conception
irresponsibility

admitted

the

appears
greater

according
our
greater

along
the

path
reflection
the

have
proceeded
when
newton
enunciated
the

gravity
did
not
say
that
the

done
the
natural

leaving

the

they
seek
for

history
stands
the

and
history
has
for
its
object
the
study
the

the
nations

humanity

not
the

from
the
time
the
law
copernicus
was
discovered
and
proved
the
mere
recognition
the
fact
that
was
not
the
sun
but
the
earth
that
moves
sufficed
destroy
the
whole
cosmography
the
ancients
disproving
that
law
might
have
been
possible
retain
the
old
conception
the
movements
the
bodies
but
without
disproving
would
seem
impossible
continue
studying
the
ptolemaic
worlds
but
even
after
the
discovery
the
law
copernicus
the
ptolemaic
worlds
were
still
studied
for
long
time
from
the
time
the
first
person
said
and
proved
that
the
number
births
crimes
subject
mathematical
laws
and
that
this
that
mode
government
determined
certain
geographical
and
economic
conditions
and
that
certain
relations
population
soil
produce
migrations
peoples
the
foundations
which
history
had
been
built
were
destroyed
their
essence
refuting
these
new
laws
the
former
view
history
might
have
been
retained
but
without
refuting
them
would
seem
impossible
continue
studying
historic

the
results
man
free
will
for
certain
mode
government
was
established
certain

peoples
took

consequence
such
and
such
geographic

then
the
free

those
individuals
who
appear
have
established
that
mode
government
occasioned
the
migrations
can
longer
regarded
the
cause
and
yet
the
former
history
continues
studied
side
side
with
the
laws
statistics
geography
political
economy
comparative
philology
and
geology
which
directly
contradict
its
assumptions
the
struggle
between
the
old
views
and
the
new
was
long
and
stubbornly
fought
out
physical
philosophy
theology
stood
guard
for
the
old
views
and
accused
the
new
violating
revelation
but
when
truth
conquered
theology
established
itself
just
firmly
the
new
foundation
just
prolonged
and
stubborn
the
struggle
now
proceeding
between
the
old
and
the
new
conception
history
and
theology
the
same
way
stands
guard
for
the
old
view
and
accuses
the
new
view
subverting
revelation
the
one
case
the
other
both
sides
the
struggle
provokes
passion
and
stifles
truth
the
one
hand
there
fear
and
regret
for
the
loss
the
whole
edifice
constructed
through
the
ages
the
other
the
passion
for
destruction
the
men
who
fought
against
the
rising
truths
physical
philosophy
seemed
that
they
admitted
that
truth
would
destroy
faith
god
the
creation
the
firmament
and
the
miracle
joshua
the
son
nun
the
defenders
the
laws
copernicus
and
newton
voltaire
for
example
seemed
that
the
laws
astronomy
destroyed
religion
and
utilized
the
law
gravitation
weapon
against
religion
just
now
seems
have
only
admit
the
law
inevitability
destroy
the
conception
the
soul
good
and
evil
and
all
the
institutions
state
and
church
that
have
been
built
those
conceptions
too
like
voltaire
his
time
uninvited
defenders
the
law
inevitability
today
use
that
law
weapon
against
religion
though
the
law
inevitability
history
like
the
law
copernicus
astronomy
far
from
destroying
even
strengthens
the
foundation
which
the
institutions
state
and
church
are
erected
the
question

then
the

history
now
the
whole
difference

based
the

nonrecognition
something
absolute
serving
the

was
the
immovability
the

the

the

the

lies
renouncing

but
astronomy
the

said
true
that

also
history
the

says
true
that

arrive

while
admitting

the

arrive
laws
the
first
case
was
necessary
renounce
the

unreal
immobility
space
and

did
not
feel
the

similarly
necessary
renounce
