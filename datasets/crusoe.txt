for

whom
had
used
the

earnest

keep
him
from
going
into
the
low
country
wars
but
could
not
prevail
his
young
desires
prompting
him
run
into
the
army
where
was
killed
and
though
said
would
not
cease
pray
for
yet
would
venture
say
that
did
take
this
foolish
step
god
would
not
bless
and
should
have
leisure
hereafter
reflect
upon
having
neglected
his
counsel
when
there
might
none
assist
recovery
observed
this
last
part
his
discourse
which
was
truly
prophetic
though
suppose
father
did
not
know
himself
say
observed
the
tears
run
down
his
face
very
plentifully
especially
when
spoke
brother
who
was
killed
and
that
when
spoke
having
leisure
repent
and
none
assist
was
moved
that
broke
off
the
discourse
and
told
his
heart
was
full
could
say
more
was
sincerely
affected
with
this
discourse
and
indeed
who
could
otherwise
and
resolved
not
think
going
abroad
any
more
but
settle
home
according
father
desire
but
alas
few
days
wore
all
off
and
short
prevent
any
father
further
importunities
few
weeks
after
resolved
run
quite
away
from
him
however
did
not
act
quite
hastily
the
first
heat
resolution
prompted
but
took
mother
time
when
thought
her
little
more
pleasant
than
ordinary
and
told
her
that
thoughts
were
entirely
bent
upon
seeing
the
world
that
should
never
settle
anything
with
resolution
enough
through
with
and
father
had
better
give
his
consent
than
force
without
that
was
now
eighteen
years
old
which
was
too
late
apprentice
trade
clerk
attorney
that
was
sure
did
should
never
serve
out
time
but
should
certainly
run
away
from
master
before
time
was
out
and
sea
and
she
would
speak
father
let
one
voyage
abroad
came
home
again
and
did
not
like
would
more
and
would
promise
double
diligence
recover
the
time
that
had
lost
this
put
mother
into
great
passion
she
told
she
knew
would
purpose
speak
father
upon
any
such
subject
that
knew
too
well
what
was
interest
give
his
consent
anything
much
for
hurt
and
that
she
wondered
how
could
think
any
such
thing
after
the
discourse
had
had
with
father
and
such
kind
and
tender
expressions
she
knew
father
had
used
and
that
short
would
ruin
myself
there
was
help
for
but
might
depend
should
never
have
their
consent
that
for
her
part
she
would
not
have
much
hand
destruction
and
should
never
have
say
that
mother
was
willing
when
father
was
not
though
mother
refused
move
father
yet
heard
afterwards
that
she
reported
all
the
discourse
him
and
that
father
after
showing
great
concern
said
her
with
sigh
that
boy
might
happy
would
stay
home
but
goes
abroad
will
the
most
miserable
wretch
that
ever
was
born
can
give
consent
was
not
till
almost
year
after
this
that
broke
loose
though
the
meantime
continued
obstinately
deaf
all
proposals
settling
business
and
frequently
expostulated
with
father
and
mother
about
their
being
positively
determined
against
what
they
knew
inclinations
prompted
but
being
one
day
hull
where
went
casually
and
without
any
purpose
making
elopement
that
time
but
say
being
there
and
one
companions
being
about
sail
london
his
father
ship
and
prompting
with
them
with
the
common
allurement
seafaring
men
that
should
cost
nothing
for
passage
consulted
neither
father
nor
mother
any
more
nor
much
sent
them
word
but
leaving
them
hear
they
might
without
asking
god
blessing
father
without
any
consideration

believe
began
sooner
continued
longer
than
mine
the
ship
was
sooner
out
the
humber
than
the
wind
began
blow
and
the
sea
rise
most
frightful
manner
and
had
never
been
sea
before
was
most
inexpressibly
sick
body
and
terrified
mind
began
now
seriously
reflect
upon
what
had
done
and
how
justly
was
overtaken
the
judgment
heaven
for
wicked
leaving
father
house
and
abandoning
duty
all
the
good
counsels
parents
father
tears
and
mother
entreaties
came
now
fresh
into
mind
and
conscience
which
was
not
yet
come
the
pitch
hardness
which
has
since
reproached
with
the
contempt
advice
and
the
breach
duty
god
and
father
all
this
while
the
storm
increased
and
the
sea
went
very
high
though
nothing
like
what
have
seen
many
times
since
nor
what
saw
few
days
after
but
was
enough
affect
then
who
was
but
young
sailor
and
had
never
known
anything
the
matter
expected
every
wave
would
have
swallowed
and
that
every
time
the
ship
fell
down
thought
did
the
trough
hollow
the
sea
should
never
rise
more
this
agony
mind
made
many
vows
and
resolutions
that
would
please
god
spare
life
this
one
voyage
ever
got
once
foot
upon
dry
land
again
would
directly
home
father
and
never
set
into
ship
again
while
lived
that
would
take
his
advice
and
never
run
myself
into
such
miseries
these
any
more
now
saw
plainly
the
goodness
his
observations
about
the
middle
station
life
how
easy
how
comfortably
had
lived
all
his
days
and
never
had
been
exposed
tempests
sea
troubles
shore
and
resolved
that
would
like
true
repenting
prodigal
home
father
these
wise
and
sober
thoughts
continued
all
the
while
the
storm
lasted
and
indeed
some
time
after
but
the
next
day
the
wind
was
abated
and
the
sea
calmer
and
began
little
inured
however
was
very
grave
for
all
that
day
being
also
little
sea
sick
still
but
towards
night
the
weather
cleared
the
wind
was
quite
over
and
charming
fine
evening
followed
the
sun
went
down
perfectly
clear
and
rose
the
next
morning
and
having
little
wind
and
smooth
sea
the
sun
shining
upon
the
sight
was
thought
the
most
delightful
that
ever
saw
had
slept
well
the
night
and
was
now
more
sea
sick
but
very
cheerful
looking
with
wonder
upon
the
sea
that
was
rough
and
terrible
the
day
before
and
could
calm
and
pleasant
little
time
after
and
now
lest
good
resolutions
should
continue
companion
who
had
enticed
away

well
bob

clapping
upon
the
shoulder
how

were
frighted

but
you
but
fresh
water
sailor
bob
come
let
make
bowl
punch
and
forget
all
that
see
what
charming
weather
tis
now
make
short
this
sad
part
story
went
the
way
all
sailors
the
punch
was
made
and
was
made
half
drunk
with
and
that
one
night
wickedness
drowned
all
repentance
all
reflections
upon
past
conduct
all
resolutions
for
the
future
word
the
sea
was
returned
its
smoothness
surface
and
settled
calmness
the
abatement
that
storm
the
hurry
thoughts
being
over
fears
and
apprehensions
being
swallowed
the
sea
being
forgotten
and
the
current
former
desires
returned
entirely
forgot
the
vows
and
promises
that
made
distress
found
indeed
some
intervals
reflection
and
the
serious
thoughts
did
were
endeavour
return
again
sometimes
but
shook
them
off
and
roused
myself
from
them
were
from
distemper
and
applying
myself
drinking
and
company
soon
mastered
the
return
those
fits
for
called
them
and
had
five
six
days
got
complete
victory
over
conscience
any
young
fellow
that
resolved
not
troubled
with
could
desire
but
was
have
another
trial
for
still
and
providence
such
cases
generally
does
resolved
leave
entirely
without
excuse
for
would
not
take
this
for
deliverance
the
next
was
such
one
the
worst
and
most
hardened
wretch
among
would
confess
both
the
danger
and
the
mercy
the
sixth
day
our
being
sea
came
into
yarmouth
roads
the
wind
having
been
contrary
and
the
weather
calm
had
made
but
little
way
since
the
storm
here
were
obliged
come
anchor
and
here
lay
the
wind
continuing
contrary
viz
south
west
for
seven
eight
days
during
which
time
great
many
ships
from
newcastle
came
into
the
same
roads
the
common
harbour
where
the
ships
might
wait
for
wind
for
the
river
had
not
however
rid
here
long
but
should
have
tided
the
river
but
that
the
wind
blew
too
fresh
and
after
had
lain
four
five
days
blew
very
hard
however
the
roads
being
reckoned
good
harbour
the
anchorage
good
and
our
ground
tackle
very
strong
our
men
were
unconcerned
and
not
the
least
apprehensive
danger
but
spent
the
time
rest
and
mirth
after
the
manner
the
sea
but
the
eighth
day
the
morning
the
wind
increased
and
had
all
hands
work
strike
our
topmasts
and
make
everything
snug
and
close
that
the
ship
might
ride
easy
possible
noon
the
sea
went
very
high
indeed
and
our
ship
rode
forecastle
shipped
several
seas
and
thought
once
twice
our
anchor
had
come
home
upon
which
our
master
ordered
out
the
sheet
anchor
that
rode
with
two
anchors
ahead
and
the
cables
veered
out
the
bitter
end
this
time
blew
terrible
storm
indeed
and
now
began
see
terror
and
amazement
the
faces
even
the
seamen
themselves
the
master
though
vigilant
the
business
preserving
the
ship
yet
went
and
out
his
cabin
could
hear
him
softly
himself
say
several
times
lord
merciful
shall
all
lost
shall
all
undone
and
the
like
during
these
first
hurries
was
stupid
lying
still
cabin
which
was
the
steerage
and
cannot
describe
temper
could
ill
resume
the
first
penitence
which
had
apparently
trampled
upon
and
hardened
myself
against
thought
the
bitterness
death
had
been
past
and
that
this
would
nothing
like
the
first
but
when
the
master
himself
came
said
just
now
and
said
should
all
lost
was
dreadfully
frighted
got
out
cabin
and
looked
out
but
such
dismal
sight
never
saw
the
sea
ran
mountains
high
and
broke
upon
every
three
four
minutes
when
could
look
about
could
see
nothing
but
distress
round
two
ships
that
rode
near
found
had
cut
their
masts
the
board
being
deep
laden
and
our
men
cried
out
that
ship
which
rode
about
mile
ahead
was
foundered
two
more
ships
being
driven
from
their
anchors
were
run
out
the
roads
sea
all
adventures
and
that
with
not
mast
standing
the
light
ships
fared
the
best
not
much
labouring
the
sea
but
two
three
them
drove
and
came
close
running
away
with
only
their
spritsail
out
before
the
wind
towards
evening
the
mate
and
boatswain
begged
the
master
our
ship
let
them
cut
away
the
fore
mast
which
was
very
unwilling
but
the
boatswain
protesting
him
that
did
not
the
ship
would
founder
consented
and
when
they
had
cut
away
the
fore
mast
the
main
mast
stood
loose
and
shook
the
ship
much
they
were
obliged
cut
that
away
also
and
make
clear
deck
any
one
may
judge
what
condition
must
all
this
who
was
but
young
sailor
and
who
had
been
such
fright
before
but
little
but
can
express
this
distance
the
thoughts
had
about
that
time
was
tenfold
more
horror
mind
upon
account
former
convictions
and
the
having
returned
from
them
the
resolutions
had
wickedly
taken
first
than
was
death
itself
and
these
added
the
terror
the
storm
put
into
such
condition
that
can
words
describe
but
the
worst
was
not
come
yet
the
storm
continued
with
such
fury
that
the
seamen
themselves
acknowledged
they
had
never
seen
worse
had
good
ship
but
she
was
deep
laden
and
wallowed
the
sea
that
the
seamen
every
now
and
then
cried
out
she
would
founder
was
advantage
one
respect
that
did
not
know

the

his

perhaps
this

what

even
everybody

just

first
was

afternoon
came
with

eight

poured
broadside
upon

which
made
him
sheer
off

pouring
also
his
small

sixty

cleared

short
this
melancholy
part
our
story
our

being
disabled
and
three
our
men
killed
and
eight
wounded
were
obliged
yield
and
were
carried
all
prisoners
into

perfectly
overwhelmed

now
looked
back
upon

now
effectually
brought

the

what

rational
for

that
for

never
had
the

encouraging
prospect
putting

very
merry

proved
very
dexterous

the

all
the
next

when
the
morning
came

with
great

some
danger

began
blow
pretty
fresh
the
morning
but
were
all
very
hungry
but
our
patron
warned
this
disaster
resolved
take
more
care
himself
for
the
future
and
having
lying
him
the
longboat
our
english
ship
that
had
taken
resolved
would
not

with
this

for
pleasure
for

with
two
three
moors
some
distinction
that
place
and
for
whom

provided
extraordinarily
and
had
therefore
sent

had
ordered

out

farther
and
then
brought

when
giving
the
boy
the
helm
stepped
forward
where
the
moor
was
and
making
stooped
for
something
behind
him
took
him
surprise
with
arm
under
his
waist
and
tossed
him
clear
overboard
into
the
sea
rose
immediately
for
swam
like
cork
and
called
begged
taken
told
would
all
over
the
world
with
swam
strong
after
the
boat
that
would
have
reached
very
quickly
there
being
but
little
wind
upon
which
stepped
into
the
cabin
and
fetching
one
the
fowling
pieces
presented
him
and
told
him
had
done
him
hurt
and
would
quiet
would
him
none
but
said
you
swim
well
enough
reach
the
shore
and
the
sea
calm
make
the
best
your
way
shore
and
will
you
harm
but
you
come
near
the
boat
shoot
you
through
the
head
for
resolved
have
liberty
turned
himself
about
and
swam
for
the
shore
and
make
doubt
but
reached
with
ease
for
was
excellent
swimmer
could
have
been
content
have
taken
this
moor
with
and
have
drowned
the
boy
but
there
was
venturing
trust
him
when
was
gone
turned
the
boy
whom
they
called
xury
and
said
him
xury
you
will
faithful
make
you
great
man
but
you
will
not
stroke
your
face
true
that
swear
mahomet
and
his
father
beard
must
throw
you
into
the
sea
too
the
boy
smiled
face
and
spoke
innocently
that
could
not
distrust
him
and
swore
faithful
and
all
over
the
world
with
while
was
view
the
moor
that
was
swimming
stood
out
directly
sea
with
the
boat
rather
stretching
windward
that
they
might
think
gone
towards
the
straits
mouth
indeed
any
one
that
had
been
their
wits
must
have
been
supposed
for
who
would
have
supposed
were
sailed
the
southward
the
truly
barbarian
coast
where
whole
nations
negroes
were
sure
surround
with
their
canoes
and
destroy
where
could
not
shore
but
should
devoured
savage
beasts
more
merciless
savages
human
kind
but
soon
grew
dusk
the
evening
changed
course
and
steered
directly
south
and
east
bending
course
little
towards
the
east
that
might
keep
with
the
shore
and
having
fair
fresh
gale
wind
and
smooth
quiet
sea
made
such
sail
that
believe
the
next
day
three
clock
the
afternoon
when
first
made
the
land
could
not
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
south
sallee
quite
beyond
the
emperor
morocco
dominions
indeed
any
other
king
thereabouts
for
saw
people
yet
such
was
the
fright
had
taken
the
moors
and
the
dreadful
apprehensions
had
falling
into
their
hands
that
would
not
stop
shore
come
anchor
the
wind
continuing
fair
till
had
sailed
that
manner
five
days
and
then
the
wind
shifting
the
southward
concluded
also
that
any
our
vessels
were
chase
they
also
would
now
give
over
ventured
make
the
coast
and
came
anchor
the
mouth
little
river
knew
not
what
nor
where
neither
what
latitude
what
country
what
nation
what
river
neither
saw
nor
desired
see
any
people
the
principal
thing
wanted
was
fresh
water
came
into
this
creek
the
evening
resolving
swim
shore
soon
was
dark
and
discover
the
country
but
soon
was
quite
dark
heard
such
dreadful
noises
the
barking
roaring
and
howling
wild
creatures
knew
not
what
kinds
that
the
poor
boy
was
ready
die
with
fear
and
begged
not
shore
till
day
well
xury
said
then
won
but
may
that
may
see
men
day
who
will
bad
those
lions
then
give
them
the
shoot
gun
says
xury
laughing
make
them
run
wey
such
english
xury
spoke
conversing
among
slaves
however
was
glad
see
the
boy
cheerful
and
gave
him
dram
out
our
patron
case
bottles
cheer
him
after
all
xury
advice
was
good
and
took
dropped
our
little
anchor
and
lay
still
all
night
say
still
for
slept
none
for
two
three
hours
saw
vast
great
creatures
knew
not
what
call
them
many
sorts
come
down
the
sea
shore
and
run
into
the
water
wallowing
and
washing
themselves
for
the
pleasure
cooling
themselves
and
they
made
such
hideous
howlings
and
yellings
that
never
indeed
heard
the
like
xury
was
dreadfully
frighted
and
indeed
was
too
but
were
both
more
frighted
when
heard
one
these
mighty
creatures
come
swimming
towards
our
boat
could
not
see
him
but
might
hear
him
his
blowing
monstrous
huge
and
furious
beast
xury
said
was
lion
and
might
for
aught
know
but
poor
xury
cried
weigh
the
anchor
and
row
away
says
xury
can
slip
our
cable
with
the
buoy
and
off
sea
they
cannot
follow
far
had
sooner
said
but
perceived
the
creature
whatever
was
within
two
oars
length
which
something
surprised
however
immediately
stepped
the
cabin
door
and
taking
gun
fired
him
upon
which
immediately
turned
about
and
swam
towards
the
shore
again
but
impossible
describe
the
horrid
noises
and
hideous
cries
and
howlings
that
were
raised
well
upon
the
edge
the
shore
higher
within
the
country
upon
the
noise
report
the
gun
thing
have
some
reason
believe
those
creatures
had
never
heard
before
this
convinced
that
there
was
going
shore
for
the
night
that
coast
and
how
venture
shore
the
day
was
another
question
too
for
have
fallen
into
the
hands
any
the
savages
had
been
bad
have
fallen
into
the
hands
the
lions
and
tigers
least
were
equally
apprehensive
the
danger
that
would
were
obliged
shore
somewhere
other
for
water
for
had
not
pint
left
the
boat
when
and
where
get
was
the
point
xury
said
would
let
him
shore
with
one
the
jars
would
find
there
was
any
water
and
bring
some
asked
him
why
would
why
should
not
and
stay
the
boat
the
boy
answered
with
much
affection
made
love
him
ever
after
says
wild
mans
come
they
eat
you
wey
well
xury
said
will
both
and
the
wild
mans
come
will
kill
them
they
shall
eat
neither
gave
xury
piece
rusk
bread
eat
and
dram
out
our
patron
case
bottles
which
mentioned
before
and
hauled
the
boat
near
the
shore
thought
was
proper
and
waded
shore
carrying
nothing
but
our
arms
and
two
jars
for
water
did
not
care
out
sight
the
boat
fearing
the
coming
canoes
with
savages
down
the
river
but
the
boy
seeing
low
place
about
mile
the
country
rambled
and
and
saw
him
come
running
towards
thought
was
pursued
some
savage
frighted
with
some
wild
beast
and
ran
forward
towards
him
help
him
but
when
came
nearer
him
saw
something
hanging
over
his
shoulders
which
was
creature
that
had
shot
like
hare
but
different
colour
and
longer
legs
however
were
very
glad
and
was
very
good
meat
but
the
great
joy
that
poor
xury
came
with
was
tell
had
found
good
water
and
seen
wild
mans
but
found
afterwards
that
need
not
take
such
pains
for
water
for
little
higher
the
creek
where
were
found
the
water
fresh
when
the
tide
was
out
which
flowed
but
little
way
filled
our
jars
and
feasted
the
hare
had
killed
and
prepared
our
way
having
seen
footsteps
any
human
creature
that
part
the
country
had
been
one
voyage
this
coast
before
knew
very
well
that
the
islands
the
canaries
and
the
cape
verde
islands
also
lay
not
far
off
from
the
coast
but
had
instruments
take
observation
know
what
latitude
were
and
not
exactly
knowing
least
remembering
what
latitude
they
were
knew
not
where
look
for
them
when
stand
off
sea
towards
them
otherwise
might
now
easily
have
found
some
these
islands
but
hope
was
that
stood
along
this
coast
till
came
that
part
where
the
english
traded
should
find
some
their
vessels
upon
their
usual
design
trade
that
would
relieve
and
take
the
best
calculation
that
place
where
now
was
must
that
country
which
lying
between
the
emperor
morocco
dominions
and
the
negroes
lies
waste
and
uninhabited
except
wild
beasts
the
negroes
having
abandoned
and
gone
farther
south
for
fear
the
moors
and
the
moors
not
thinking
worth
inhabiting
reason
its
barrenness
and
indeed
both
forsaking
because
the
prodigious
number
tigers
lions
leopards
and
other
furious
creatures
which
harbour
there
that
the
moors
use
for
their
hunting
only
where
they
like
army
two
three
thousand
men
time
and
indeed
for
near
hundred
miles
together
upon
this
coast
saw
nothing
but
waste
uninhabited
country
day
and
heard
nothing
but
howlings
and
roaring
wild
beasts
night
once
twice
the
daytime
thought
saw
the
pico
teneriffe
being
the
high
top
the
mountain
teneriffe
the
canaries
and
had
great
mind
venture
out
hopes
reaching
thither
but
having
tried
twice
was
forced
again
contrary
winds
the
sea
also
going
too
high
for
little
vessel
resolved
pursue
first
design
and
keep
along
the
shore
several
times
was
obliged
land
for
fresh
water
after
had
left
this
place
and
once
particular
being
early
morning
came
anchor
under
little
point
land
which
was
pretty
high
and
the
tide
beginning
flow
lay
still
farther
xury
whose
eyes
were
more
about
him
than
seems
mine
were
calls
softly
and
tells
that
had
best
farther
off
the
shore
for
says
look
yonder
lies
dreadful
monster
the
side
that
hillock
fast
asleep
looked
where
pointed
and
saw
dreadful
monster
indeed
for
was
terrible
great
lion
that
lay
the
side
the
shore
under
the
shade
piece
the
hill
that
hung
were
little
over
him
xury
says
you
shall
shore
and
kill
him
xury
looked
frighted
and
said
kill
eat
one
mouth
one
mouthful
meant
however
said
more
the
boy
but
bade
him
lie
still
and
took
our
biggest
gun
which
was
almost
musket
bore
and
loaded
with
good
charge
powder
and
with
two
slugs
and
laid
down
then
loaded
another
gun
with
two
bullets
and
the
third
for
had
three
pieces
loaded
with
five
smaller
bullets
took
the
best
aim
could
with
the
first
piece
have
shot
him
the
head
but
lay
with
his
leg
raised
little
above
his
nose
that
the
slugs
hit
his
leg
about
the
knee
and
broke
the
bone
started
growling
first
but
finding
his
leg
broken
fell
down
again
and
then
got
upon
three
legs
and
gave
the
most
hideous
roar
that
ever
heard
was
little
surprised
that
had
not
hit
him
the
head
however
took
the
second
piece
immediately
and
though
began
move
off
fired
again
and
shot
him
the
head
and
had
the
pleasure
see
him
drop
and
make
but
little
noise
but
lie
struggling
for
life
then
xury
took
heart
and
would
have
let
him
shore
well
said
the
boy
jumped
into
the
water
and
taking
little
gun
one
hand
swam
shore
with
the
other
hand
and
coming
close
the
creature
put
the
muzzle
the
piece
his
ear
and
shot
him
the
head
again
which
despatched
him
quite
this
was
game
indeed
but
this
was
food
and
was
very
sorry
lose
three
charges
powder
and
shot
upon
creature
that
was
good
for
nothing
however
xury
said
would
have
some
him
comes
board
and
asked
give
him
the
hatchet
for
what
xury
said
cut
off
his
head
said
however
xury
could
not
cut
off
his
head
but
cut
off
foot
and
brought
with
him
and
was
monstrous
great
one
bethought
myself
however
that
perhaps
the
skin
him
might
one
way
other
some
value
and
resolved
take
off
his
skin
could
xury
and
went
work
with
him
but
xury
was
much
the
better
workman
for
knew
very
ill
how
indeed
took
both
the
whole
day
but
last
got
off
the
hide
him
and
spreading
the
top
our
cabin
the
sun
effectually
dried
two
days
time
and
afterwards
served
lie
upon
chapter
iii
wrecked
desert
island
after
this
stop
made
the
southward
continually
for
ten
twelve
days
living
very
sparingly
our
provisions
which
began
abate
very
much
and
going
oftener
the
shore
than
were
obliged
for
fresh
water
design
this
was
make
the
river
gambia
senegal
that
say
anywhere
about
the
cape
verde
where
was
hopes
meet
with
some
european
ship
and
did
not
knew
not
what
course
had
take
but
seek
for
the
islands
perish
there
among
the
negroes
knew
that
all
the
ships
from
europe
which
sailed
either
the
coast
guinea
brazil
the
east
indies
made
this
cape
those
islands
and
word
put
the
whole
fortune
upon
this
single
point
either
that
must
meet
with
some
ship
must
perish
when
had
pursued
this
resolution
about
ten
days
longer
have
said
began
see
that
the
land
was
inhabited
and
two
three
places
sailed
saw
people
stand
upon
the
shore
look
could
also
perceive
they
were
quite
black
and
naked
was
once
inclined
have
gone
shore
them
but
xury
was
better
counsellor
and
said
however
hauled
nearer
the
shore
that
might
talk
them
and
found
they
ran
along
the
shore
good
way
observed
they
had
weapons
their
hand
except
one
who
had
long
slender
stick
which
xury
said
was
lance
and
that
they
could
throw
them
great
way
with
good
aim
kept
distance
but
talked
with
them
signs
well
could
and
particularly
made
signs
for
something
eat
they
beckoned
stop
boat
and
they
would
fetch
some
meat
upon
this
lowered
the
top
sail
and
lay
and
two
them
ran
into
the
country
and
less
than
half
hour
came
back
and
brought
with
them
two
pieces
dried
flesh
and
some
corn
such
the
produce
their
country
but
neither
knew
what
the
one
the
other
was
however
were
willing
accept
but
how
come
was
our
next
dispute
for
would
not
venture
shore
them
and
they
were
much
afraid
but
they
took
safe
way
for
all
for
they
brought
the
shore
and
laid
down
and
went
and
stood
great
way
off
till
fetched
board
and
then
came
close
again
made
signs
thanks
them
for
had
nothing
make
them
amends
but
opportunity
offered
that
very
instant
oblige
them
wonderfully
for
while
were
lying
the
shore
came
two
mighty
creatures
one
pursuing
the
other
took
with
great
fury
from
the
mountains
towards
the
sea
whether
was
the
male
pursuing
the
female
whether
they
were
sport
rage
could
not
tell
any
more
than
could
tell
whether
was
usual
strange
but
believe
was
the
latter
because
the
first
place
those
ravenous
creatures
seldom
appear
but
the
night
and
the
second
place
found
the
people
terribly
frighted
especially
the
women
the
man
that
had
the
lance
dart
did
not
fly
from
them
but
the
rest
did
however
the
two
creatures
ran
directly
into
the
water
they
did
not
offer
fall
upon
any
the
negroes
but
plunged
themselves
into
the
sea
and
swam
about
they
had
come
for
their
diversion
last
one
them
began
come
nearer
our
boat
than
first
expected
but
lay
ready
for
him
for
had
loaded
gun
with
all
possible
expedition
and
bade
xury
load
both
the
others
soon
came
fairly
within
reach
fired
and
shot
him
directly
the
head
immediately
sank
down
into
the
water
but
rose
instantly
and
plunged
and
down
were
struggling
for
life
and
indeed
was
immediately
made
the
shore
but
between
the
wound
which
was
his
mortal
hurt
and
the
strangling
the
water
died
just
before
reached
the
shore
impossible
express
the
astonishment
these
poor
creatures
the
noise
and
fire
gun
some
them
were
even
ready
die
for
fear
and
fell
down
dead
with
the
very
terror
but
when
they
saw
the
creature
dead
and
sunk
the
water
and
that
made
signs
them
come
the
shore
they
took
heart
and
came
and
began
search
for
the
creature
found
him
his
blood
staining
the
water
and
the
help
rope
which
slung
round
him
and
gave
the
negroes
haul
they
dragged
him
shore
and
found
that
was
most
curious
leopard
spotted
and
fine
admirable
degree
and
the
negroes
held
their
hands
with
admiration
think
what
was
had
killed
him
with
the
other
creature
frighted
with
the
flash
fire
and
the
noise
the
gun
swam
shore
and
ran
directly
the
mountains
from
whence
they
came
nor
could
that
distance
know
what
was
found
quickly
the
negroes
wished
eat
the
flesh
this
creature
was
willing
have
them
take
favour
from
which
when
made
signs
them
that
they
might
take
him
they
were
very
thankful
for
immediately
they
fell
work
with
him
and
though
they
had
knife
yet
with
sharpened
piece
wood
they
took
off
his
skin
readily
and
much
more
readily
than
could
have
done
with
knife
they
offered
some
the
flesh
which
declined
pointing
out
that
would
give
them
but
made
signs
for
the
skin
which
they
gave
very
freely
and
brought
great
deal
more
their
provisions
which
though
did
not
understand
yet
accepted
then
made
signs
them
for
some
water
and
held
out
one
jars
them
turning
bottom
upward
show
that
was
empty
and
that
wanted
have
filled
they
called
immediately
some
their
friends
and
there
came
two
women
and
brought
great
vessel
made
earth
and
burnt
supposed
the
sun
this
they
set
down
before
and
sent
xury
shore
with
jars
and
filled
them
all
three
the
women
were
naked
the
men
was
now
furnished
with
roots
and
corn
such
was
and
water
and
leaving
friendly
negroes
made
forward
for
about
eleven
days
more
without
offering
near
the
shore
till
saw
the
land
run
out
great
length
into
the
sea
about
the
distance
four
five
leagues
before
and
the
sea
being
very
calm
kept
large
offing
make
this
point
length
doubling
the
point
about
two
leagues
from
the
land
saw
plainly
land
the
other
side
seaward
then
concluded
was
most
certain
indeed
that
this
was
the
cape
verde
and
those
the
islands
called
from
thence
cape
verde
islands
however
they
were
great
distance
and
could
not
well
tell
what
had
best
for
should
taken
with
fresh
wind
might
neither
reach
one
other
this
dilemma
was
very
pensive
stepped
into
the
cabin
and
sat
down
xury
having
the
helm
when
sudden
the
boy
cried
out
master
master
ship
with
sail
and
the
foolish
boy
was
frighted
out
his
wits
thinking
must
needs
some
his
master
ships
sent
pursue
but
knew
were
far
enough
out
their
reach
jumped
out
the
cabin
and
immediately
saw
not
only
the
ship
but
that
was
portuguese
ship
and
thought
was
bound
the
coast
guinea
for
negroes
but
when
observed
the
course
she
steered
was
soon
convinced
they
were
bound
some
other
way
and
did
not
design
come
any
nearer
the
shore
upon
which
stretched
out
sea
much
could
resolving
speak
with
them
possible
with
all
the
sail
could
make
found
should
not
able
come
their
way
but
that
they
would
gone
before
could
make
any
signal
them
but
after
had
crowded
the
utmost
and
began
despair
they
seems
saw
the
help
their
glasses
that
was
some
european
boat
which
they
supposed
must
belong
some
ship
that
was
lost
they
shortened
sail
let
come
was
encouraged
with
this
and
had
patron
ancient
board
made
waft
them
for
signal
distress
and
fired
gun
both
which
they
saw
for
they
told
they
saw
the
smoke
though
they
did
not
hear
the
gun
upon
these
signals
they
very
kindly
brought
and
lay
for
and
about
three
hours
time
came
with
them
they
asked
what
was
portuguese
and
spanish
and
french
but
understood
none
them
but
last
scotch
sailor
who
was
board
called
and
answered
him
and
told
him
was
englishman
that
had
made
escape
out
slavery
from
the
moors
sallee
they
then
bade
come
board
and
very
kindly
took
and
all
goods
was
inexpressible
joy
which
any
one
will
believe
that
was
thus
delivered
esteemed
from
such
miserable
and
almost
hopeless
condition
was
and
immediately
offered
all
had
the
captain
the
ship
return
for
deliverance
but
generously
told
would
take
nothing
from
but
that
all
had
should

came

what
next
with

eight
all
cargo
and
with
this
stock
went
shore
the
brazils
had
not
been
long
here
before
was
recommended
the
house
good
honest
man
like
himself
who
had
ingenio
they
call
that
plantation
and
sugar
house
lived
with
him
some
time
and
acquainted
myself
that
means
with
the
manner
planting
and
making
sugar
and
seeing
how
well
the
planters
lived
and
how
they
got
rich
suddenly
resolved
could
get
licence
settle
there
would
turn
planter
among
them
resolving
the
meantime
find
out
some
way
get
money
which
had
left
london
remitted
this
purpose
getting
kind
letter
naturalisation
purchased
much
land
that
was
uncured
money
would
reach
and
formed
plan
for
plantation
and
settlement
such
one
might
suitable
the
stock
which
proposed
myself
receive
from
england
had
neighbour
portuguese
lisbon
but
born
english
parents
whose
name
was
wells
and
much
such
circumstances
was
call
him
neighbour
because
his
plantation
lay
next
mine
and
went
very
sociably
together
stock
was
but
low
well
his
and
rather
planted
for
food
than
anything
else
for
about
two
years
however
began
increase
and
our
land
began
come
into
order
that
the
third
year
planted
some
tobacco
and
made
each
large
piece
ground
ready
for
planting
canes
the
year
come
but
both
wanted
help
and
now
found
more
than
before
had
done
wrong
parting
with
boy
xury
but
alas
for
wrong
that
never
did
right
was
great
wonder
hail
remedy
but
had
got
into
employment
quite
remote
genius
and
directly
contrary
the
life
delighted
and
for
which
forsook
father
house
and
broke
through
all
his
good
advice
nay
was
coming
into
the
very
middle
station
upper
degree
low
life
which
father
advised
before
and
which
resolved
with
might
well
have
stayed
home
and
never
have
fatigued
myself
the
world
had
done
and
used
often
say
myself
could
have
done
this
well
england
among
friends
have
gone
five
thousand
miles
off
among
strangers
and
savages

and
such
distance
never

from
any
part
the
world
that
had
the
least
knowledge
this
manner
used
look
upon
condition
with
the
utmost
regret
had
nobody
converse
with
but
now
and
then
this
neighbour
work
done
but
the
labour
hands
and
used
say
lived
just
like
man
cast
away
upon
some
desolate
island
that
had
nobody
there
but
himself
but
how
just
has
been
and
how
should
all
men
reflect
that
when
they
compare
their
present
conditions
with
others
that
are
worse
heaven
may
oblige
them
make
the
exchange
and
convinced

how
just
has
been

then
led

all

been
exceeding
prosperous
and

was
some

for
carrying
the

before
kind
friend
the
captain
the
ship
that
took
sea
went
back
for
the
ship
remained
there
providing
his
lading
and
preparing
for
his
voyage
nearly
three
months
when
telling
him
what
little
stock
had
left
behind
london
gave
this
friendly
and
sincere
advice
seignior
inglese
says
for
always
called
you
will
give
letters
and
procuration
form
with
orders
the
person
who
has
your
money
london
send
your
effects
lisbon
such
persons
shall
direct
and
such
goods
are
proper
for
this
country
will
bring
you
the
produce
them
god
willing
return
but
since
human
affairs
are
all
subject
changes
and
disasters
would
have
you
give
orders
but
for
one
hundred
pounds
sterling
which
you
say
half
your
stock
and
let
the
hazard
run
for
the
first
that
come
safe
you
may
order
the
rest
the
same
way
and
miscarry
you
may
have
the
other
half
have
recourse
for
your
supply
this
was
wholesome
advice
and
looked
friendly
that
could
not
but
convinced
was
the
best
course
could
take
accordingly
prepared
letters
the
gentlewoman
with
whom
had
left

and
procuration
the
portuguese

the
english

the
humanity
his

and
what

was
now
with

when

there
send
over
not
the
order
only
but
full
account

who
represented
effectually
her
whereupon
she
not
only
delivered
the

out

very
handsome
present
for

which
were

when

time
not
only
not
far
entered
into
but
far
was
had
been
carried
assientos
permission
the
kings
spain
and
portugal
and
engrossed
the
public
stock
that
few
negroes
were
bought
and
these
excessively
dear
happened
being
company
with
some
merchants
and
planters
acquaintance
and
talking
those
things
very
earnestly
three
them
came
next
morning
and
told
they
had
been
musing
very
much
upon
what
had
discoursed
with
them
the
last
night
and
they
came
make
secret
proposal
and
after
enjoining
secrecy
they
told
that
they
had
mind
fit
out
ship
guinea
that
they
had
all
plantations
well
and
were
straitened
for
nothing
much
servants
that
was
trade
that
could
not
carried
because
they
could
not
publicly
sell
the
negroes
when
they
came
home
they
desired
make
but
one
voyage
bring
the
negroes
shore
privately
and
divide
them
among
their
own
plantations
and
word
the
question
was
whether
would
their
supercargo
the
ship
manage
the
trading
part
upon
the
coast
guinea
and
they
offered
that
should
have
equal
share
the
negroes
without
providing
any
part
the
stock
this
was
fair
proposal
must
confessed
had
been
made
any
one
that
had
not
had
settlement
and
plantation
his
own
look
after
which
was
fair
way
coming
very
considerable
and
with
good
stock
upon
but
for
that
was
thus
entered
and
established
and
had
nothing
but
had
begun
for
three
four
years
more
and
have
sent
for
the
other
hundred
pounds
from
england
and
who
that
time
and
with
that
little
addition
could
scarce
have
failed
being
worth
three
four
thousand
pounds
sterling
and
that
increasing
too
for
think
such
voyage
was
the
most
preposterous
thing
that
ever
man
such
circumstances
could
guilty
but
that
was
born
own
destroyer
could
more
resist
the
offer
than
could
restrain
first
rambling
designs
when
father
good
counsel
was
lost
upon
word
told
them
would
with
all
heart
they
would
undertake

after

would

they
all
engaged

was

furnished
and

the
voyage
went
board
evil
hour
the

being
the

day
eight
years
that
went
from
father
and
mother
hull
order
act
the
rebel
their
authority
and
the
fool
own
interests
our
ship
was
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
tons
burden
carried
six
guns
and
fourteen
men
besides
the
master
his
boy
and
myself
had
board
large

goods
except
such

were
fit
for
our

with
the

such
beads

shells
and
other
trifles
especially
little
looking
glasses
knives
scissors
hatchets
and
the
like
the
same
day
went
board
set
sail
standing
away
the
northward
upon
our
own
coast
with
design
stretch
over
for
the
african
coast
when
came
about
ten
twelve
degrees
northern
latitude
which
seems
was
the
manner
course
those
days
had
very
good
weather
only
excessively
hot
all
the
way
upon
our
own
coast
till
came
the
height
cape
augustino
from
whence
keeping
further
off
sea
lost
sight
land
and
steered
were
bound
for
the
isle
fernando
noronha
holding
our
course
and
leaving
those
isles
the
east
this
course
passed
the
line
about
twelve
days
time
and
were
our
last
observation
seven
degrees
twenty
two
minutes
northern
latitude
when
violent
tornado
hurricane
took
quite
out
our
knowledge
began
from
the
south
east
came
about
the
north
west
and
then
settled
the
north
east
from
whence
blew
such
terrible
manner
that
for
twelve
days
together
could
nothing
but
drive
and
scudding
away
before
let
carry
whither
fate
and
the
fury
the
winds
directed
and
during
these
twelve
days
need
not
say
that
expected
every
day
swallowed
nor
indeed
did
any
the
ship
expect
save
their
lives
this
distress
had
besides
the
terror
the
storm
one
our
men
die
the
calenture
and
one
man
and
the
boy
washed
overboard
about
the
twelfth
day
the
weather
abating
little
the
master
made
observation
well
could
and
found
that
was
about
eleven
degrees
north
latitude
but
that
was
twenty
two
degrees
longitude
difference
west
from
cape
augustino
that
found
was
upon
the
coast
guiana
the
north
part
brazil
beyond
the
river
amazon
toward
that
the
river
orinoco
commonly
called
the
great
river
and
began
consult
with
what
course
should
take
for
the
ship
was
leaky
and
very
much
disabled
and
was
going
directly
back
the
coast
brazil
was
positively
against
that
and
looking
over
the
charts
the
sea
coast
america
with
him
concluded
there
was
inhabited
country
for
have
recourse
till
came
within
the
circle
the
caribbee
islands
and
therefore
resolved
stand
away
for
barbadoes
which
keeping
off
sea
avoid
the
indraft
the
bay
gulf
mexico
might
easily
perform
hoped
about
fifteen
days
sail
whereas
could
not
possibly
make
our
voyage
the
coast
africa
without
some
assistance
both
our
ship
and
ourselves
with
this
design
changed
our
course
and
steered
away
order
reach
some
our
english
islands
where
hoped
for
relief
but
our
voyage
was
otherwise
determined
for
being
the
latitude
twelve
degrees
eighteen
minutes
second
storm
came
upon
which
carried
away
with
the
same
impetuosity
westward
and
drove
out
the
way
all
human
commerce
that
had
all
our
lives
been
saved
the
sea
were
rather
danger
being
devoured
savages
than
ever
returning
our
own
country
this
distress
the
wind
still
blowing
very
hard
one
our
men
early
the
morning
cried
out
land
and
had
sooner
run
out
the
cabin
look
out
hopes
seeing
whereabouts
the
world
were
than
the
ship
struck
upon
sand
and
moment
her
motion
being
stopped
the
sea
broke
over
her
such
manner
that
expected
should
all
have
perished
immediately
and
were
immediately
driven
into
our
close
quarters
shelter
from
the
very
foam
and
spray
the
sea
not
easy
for
any
one
who
has
not
been
the
like
condition
describe
conceive
the
consternation
men
such
circumstances
knew
nothing
where
were
upon
what
land
was
were
driven
whether
island
the
main
whether
inhabited
not
inhabited
the
rage
the
wind
was
still
great
though
rather
less
than
first
could
not
much
hope
have
the
ship
hold
many
minutes
without
breaking
into
pieces
unless
the
winds
kind
miracle
should
turn
immediately
about
word
sat
looking
upon
one
another
and
expecting
death
every
moment
and
every
man
accordingly
preparing
for
another
world
for
there
was
little
nothing
more
for
this
that
which
was
our
present
comfort
and
all
the
comfort
had
was
that
contrary
our
expectation
the
ship
did
not
break
yet
and
that
the
master
said
the
wind
began
abate
now
though
thought
that
the
wind
did
little
abate
yet
the
ship
having
thus
struck
upon
the
sand
and
sticking
too
fast
for
expect
her
getting
off
were
dreadful
condition
indeed
and
had
nothing
but
think
saving
our
lives
well
could
had
boat
our
stern
just
before
the
storm
but
she
was
first
staved
dashing
against
the
ship
rudder
and
the
next
place
she
broke
away
and
either
sunk
was
driven
off
sea
there
was
hope
from
her
had
another
boat
board
but
how
get
her
off
into
the
sea
was
doubtful
thing
however
there
was
time
debate
for
fancied
that
the
ship
would
break
pieces
every
minute
and
some
told
she
was
actually
broken
already
this
distress
the
mate
our
vessel
laid
hold
the
boat
and
with
the
help
the
rest
the
men
got
her
slung
over
the
ship
side
and
getting
all
into
her
let
and
committed
ourselves
being
eleven
number
god
mercy
and
the
wild
sea
for
though
the
storm
was
abated
considerably
yet
the
sea
ran
dreadfully
high
upon
the
shore
and
might
well
called
den
wild
zee
the
dutch
call
the
sea
storm
and
now
our
case
was
very
dismal
indeed
for
all
saw
plainly
that
the
sea
went
high
that
the
boat
could
not
live
and
that
should
inevitably
drowned
making
sail
had
none
nor
had
could
have
done
anything
with
worked
the
oar
towards
the
land
though
with
heavy
hearts
like
men
going
execution
for
all
knew
that
when
the
boat
came
near
the
shore
she
would
dashed
thousand
pieces
the
breach
the
sea
however
committed
our
souls
god
the
most
earnest
manner
and
the
wind
driving
towards
the
shore
hastened
our
destruction
with
our
own
hands
pulling
well
could
towards
land
what
the
shore
was
whether
rock
sand
whether
steep
shoal
knew
not
the
only
hope
that
could
rationally
give
the
least
shadow
expectation
was
might
find
some
bay
gulf
the
mouth
some
river
where
great
chance
might
have
run
our
boat
got
under
the
lee
the
land
and
perhaps
made
smooth
water
but
there
was
nothing
like
this
appeared
but
made
nearer
and
nearer
the
shore
the
land
looked
more
frightful
than
the
sea
after
had
rowed
rather
driven
about
league
and
half
reckoned
raging
wave
mountain
like
came
rolling
astern
and
plainly
bade
expect
the
coup
grâce
took
with
such
fury
that
overset
the
boat
once
and
separating
well
from
the
boat
from
one
another
gave
time
say
god
for
were
all
swallowed
moment
nothing
can
describe
the
confusion
thought
which
felt
when
sank
into
the
water
for
though
swam
very
well
yet
could
not
deliver
myself
from
the
waves
draw
breath
till
that
wave
having
driven
rather
carried
vast
way
towards
the
shore
and
having
spent
itself
went
back
and
left
upon
the
land
almost
dry
but
half
dead
with
the
water
took
had
much
presence
mind
well
breath
left
that
seeing
myself
nearer
the
mainland
than
expected
got
upon
feet
and
endeavoured
make
towards
the
land
fast
could
before
another
wave
should
return
and
take
again
but
soon
found
was
impossible
avoid
for
saw
the
sea
come
after
high
great
hill
and
furious
enemy
which
had
means
strength
contend
with
business
was
hold
breath
and
raise
myself
upon
the
water
could
and
swimming
preserve
breathing
and
pilot
myself
towards
the
shore
possible
greatest
concern
now
being
that
the
sea
would
carry
great
way
towards
the
shore
when
came
might
not
carry
back
again
with
when
gave
back
towards
the
sea
the
wave
that
came
upon
again
buried
once
twenty
thirty
feet
deep
its
own
body
and
could
feel
myself
carried
with
mighty
force
and
swiftness
towards
the
shore
very
great
way
but
held
breath
and
assisted
myself
swim
still
forward
with
all
might
was
ready
burst
with
holding
breath
when
felt
myself
rising
immediate
relief
found
head
and
hands
shoot
out
above
the
surface
the
water
and
though
was
not
two
seconds
time
that
could
keep
myself
yet
relieved
greatly
gave
breath
and
new
courage
was
covered
again
with
water
good
while
but
not
long
but
held
out
and
finding
the
water
had
spent
itself
and
began
return
struck
forward
against
the
return
the
waves
and
felt
ground
again
with
feet
stood
still
few
moments
recover
breath
and
till
the
waters
went
from
and
then
took
heels
and
ran
with
what
strength
had
further
towards
the
shore
but
neither
would
this
deliver
from
the
fury
the
sea
which
came
pouring
after
again
and
twice
more
was
lifted
the
waves
and
carried
forward
before
the
shore
being
very
flat
the
last
time
these
two
had
well
nigh
been
fatal
for
the
sea
having
hurried
along
before
landed
rather
dashed
against
piece
rock
and
that
with
such
force
that
left
senseless
and
indeed
helpless
own
deliverance
for
the
blow
taking
side
and
breast
beat
the
breath
were
quite
out
body
and
had
returned
again
immediately
must
have
been
strangled
the
water
but
recovered
little
before
the
return
the
waves
and
seeing
should
covered
again
with
the
water
resolved
hold
fast
piece
the
rock
and
hold
breath
possible
till
the
wave
went
back
now
the
waves
were
not
high
first
being
nearer
land
held
hold
till
the
wave
abated
and
then
fetched
another
run
which
brought
near
the
shore
that
the
next
wave
though
went
over
yet
did
not
swallow
carry
away
and
the
next
run
took
got
the
mainland
where
great
comfort
clambered
the
cliffs
the
shore
and
sat
down
upon
the
grass
free
from
danger
and
quite
out
the
reach
the
water
was
now
landed
and
safe
shore
and
began
look
and
thank
god
that
life
was
saved
case
wherein
there
was
some
minutes
before
scarce
any
room
hope
believe
impossible
express
the
life
what
the
ecstasies
and
transports
the
soul
are
when
saved
may
say
out
the
very
grave
and
not
wonder
now
the
custom
when
malefactor
who
has
the
halter
about
his
neck
tied
and
just
going
turned
off
and
has
reprieve
brought
him
say
not
wonder
that
they
bring
surgeon
with
let
him
blood
that
very
moment
they
tell
him
that
the
surprise
may
not
drive
the
animal
spirits
from
the
heart
and
overwhelm
him
for
sudden
joys
like
griefs
confound
first
walked
about
the
shore
lifting
hands
and
whole
being
may
say
wrapped
contemplation
deliverance
making
thousand
gestures
and
motions
which
cannot
describe
reflecting
upon
all
comrades
that
were
drowned
and
that
there
should
not
one
soul
saved
but
myself
for
for
them
never
saw
them
afterwards
any
sign
them
except
three
their
hats
one
cap
and
two
shoes
that
were
not
fellows
cast
eye
the
stranded
vessel
when
the
breach
and
froth
the
sea
being
big
could
hardly
see
lay
far
and
considered
lord
how
was
possible
could
get
shore
after
had
solaced
mind
with
the
comfortable
part
condition
began
look
round
see
what
kind
place
was
and
what
was
next
done
and
soon
found
comforts
abate
and
that
word
had
dreadful
deliverance
for
was
wet
had
clothes
shift
nor
anything
either
eat
drink
comfort
neither
did
see
any
prospect
before
but
that
perishing
with
hunger
being
devoured
wild
beasts
and
that
which
was
particularly
afflicting
was
that
had
weapon
either
hunt
and
kill
any
creature
for
sustenance
defend
myself
against
any
other
creature
that
might
desire
kill
for
theirs
word
had
nothing
about
but
knife
tobacco
pipe
and
little
tobacco
box
this
was
all
provisions
and
this
threw
into
such
terrible
agonies
mind
that
for
while
ran
about
like
madman
night
coming
upon
began
with
heavy
heart
consider
what
would
lot
there
were
any
ravenous
beasts
that
country
night
they
always
come
abroad
for
their
prey
all
the
remedy
that
offered
thoughts
that
time
was
get
into
thick
bushy
tree
like
fir
but
thorny
which
grew
near
and
where
resolved
sit
all
night
and
consider
the
next
day
what
death
should
die
for
yet
saw
prospect
life
walked
about
furlong
from
the
shore
see
could
find
any
fresh
water
drink
which
did
great
joy
and
having
drank
and
put
little
tobacco
into
mouth
prevent
hunger
went
the
tree
and
getting
into
endeavoured
place
myself
that
should
sleep
might
not
fall
and
having
cut
short
stick
like
truncheon
for
defence
took
lodging
and
having
been
excessively
fatigued
fell
fast
asleep
and
slept
comfortably
believe
few
could
have
done
condition
and
found
myself
more
refreshed
with
than
think
ever
was
such
occasion
chapter
first
weeks
the
island
when
waked
was
broad
day
the
weather
clear
and
the
storm
abated
that
the
sea
did
not
rage
and
swell
before
but
that
which
surprised
most
was
that
the
ship
was
lifted
off
the
night
from
the
sand
where
she
lay
the
swelling
the
tide
and
was
driven
almost
far
the
rock
which
first
mentioned
where
had
been
bruised
the
wave
dashing
against
this
being
within
about
mile
from
the
shore
where
was
and
the
ship
seeming
stand
upright
still
wished
myself
board
that
least
might
save
some
necessary
things
for
use
when
came
down
from
apartment
the
tree
looked
about
again
and
the
first
thing
found
was
the
boat
which
lay
the
wind
and
the
sea
had
tossed
her
upon
the
land
about
two
miles
right
hand
walked
far
could
upon
the
shore
have
got
her
but
found
neck
inlet
water
between
and
the
boat
which
was
about
half
mile
broad
came
back
for
the
present
being
more
intent
upon
getting
the
ship
where
hoped
find
something
for
present
subsistence
little
after
noon
found
the
sea
very
calm
and
the
tide
ebbed
far
out
that
could
come
within
quarter
mile
the
ship
and
here
found
fresh
renewing
grief
for
saw
evidently
that
had
kept
board
had
been
all
safe
that
say
had
all
got
safe
shore
and
had
not
been
miserable
left
entirety
destitute
all
comfort
and
company
now
was
this
forced
tears
eyes
again
but
there
was
little
relief
that
resolved
possible
get
the
ship
pulled
off
clothes
for
the
weather
was
hot
extremity
and
took
the
water
but
when
came
the
ship
difficulty
was
still
greater
know
how
get
board
for
she
lay
aground
and
high
out
the
water
there
was
nothing
within
reach
lay
hold
swam
round
her
twice
and
the
second
time
spied
small
piece
rope
which
wondered
did
not
see
first
hung
down
the
fore
chains
low
that
with
great
difficulty
got
hold
and
the
help
that
rope
got
into
the
forecastle
the
ship
here
found
that
the
ship
was
bulged
and
had
great
deal
water
her
hold
but
that
she
lay
the
side
bank
hard
sand
rather
earth
that
her
stern
lay
lifted
upon
the
bank
and
her
head
low
almost
the
water
this
means
all
her
quarter
was
free
and
all
that
was
that
part
was
dry
for
you
may
sure
first
work
was
search
and
see
what
was
spoiled
and
what
was
free
and
first
found
that
all
the
ship
provisions
were
dry
and
untouched
the
water
and
being
very
well
disposed
eat
went
the
bread
room
and
filled
pockets
with
biscuit
and
ate
went
about
other
things
for
had
time
lose
also
found
some
rum
the
great
cabin
which
took
large
dram
and
which
had
indeed
need
enough
spirit
for
what
was
before
now
wanted
nothing
but
boat
furnish
myself
with
many
things
which
foresaw
would
very
necessary
was
vain
sit
still
and
wish
for
what
was
not
had
and
this
extremity
roused
application
had
several
spare
yards
and
two
three
large
spars
wood
and
spare
topmast
two
the
ship
resolved
fall
work
with
these
and
flung
many
them
overboard
could
manage
for
their
weight
tying
every
one
with
rope
that
they
might
not
drive
away
when
this
was
done
went
down
the
ship
side
and
pulling
them
tied
four
them
together
both
ends
well
could
the
form
raft
and
laying
two
three
short
pieces
plank
upon
them
crossways
found
could
walk
upon
very
well
but
that
was
not
able
bear
any
great
weight
the
pieces
being
too
light
went
work
and
with
carpenter
saw
cut
spare
topmast
into
three
lengths
and
added
them
raft
with
great
deal
labour
and
pains
but
the
hope
furnishing
myself
with
necessaries
encouraged
beyond
what
should
have
been
able
have
done
upon
another
occasion
raft
was
now
strong
enough
bear
any
reasonable
weight
next
care
was
what
load
with
and
how
preserve
what
laid
upon
from
the
surf
the
sea
but
was
not
long
considering
this
first
laid
all
the
planks
boards
upon
that
could
get
and
having
considered
well
what
most
wanted
got
three
the
seamen
chests
which
had
broken
open
and
emptied
and
lowered
them
down
upon
raft
the
first
these
filled
with
provisions
viz
bread
rice
three
dutch
cheeses
five
pieces
dried
goat
flesh
which
lived
much
upon
and
little
remainder
european
corn
which
had
been
laid
for
some
fowls
which
brought
sea
with
but
the
fowls
were
killed
there
had
been
some
barley
and
wheat
together
but
great
disappointment
found
afterwards
that
the
rats
had
eaten
spoiled
all
for
liquors
found
several
cases
bottles
belonging
our
skipper
which
were
some
cordial
waters
and
all
about
five
six
gallons
rack
these
stowed
themselves
there
being
need
put
them
into
the
chest
nor
any
room
for
them
while
was
doing
this
found
the
tide
begin
flow
though
very
calm
and
had
the
mortification
see
coat
shirt
and
waistcoat
which
had
left
the
shore
upon
the
sand
swim
away
for
breeches
which
were
only
linen
and
open
kneed
swam
board
them
and
stockings
however
this
set
rummaging
for
clothes
which
found
enough
but
took
more
than
wanted
for
present
use
for
had
others
things
which
eye
was
more
upon
first
tools
work
with
shore
and
was
after
long
searching
that
found
out
the
carpenter
chest
which
was
indeed
very
useful
prize
and
much
more
valuable
than
shipload
gold
would
have
been
that
time
got
down
raft
whole
was
without
losing
time
look
into
for
knew
general
what
contained
next
care
was
for
some
ammunition
and
arms
there
were
two
very
good
fowling
pieces
the
great
cabin
and
two
pistols
these
secured
first
with
some
powder
horns
and
small
bag
shot
and
two
old
rusty
swords
knew
there
were
three
barrels
powder
the
ship
but
knew
not
where
our
gunner
had
stowed
them
but
with
much
search
found
them
two
them
dry
and
good
the
third
had
taken
water
those
two
got
raft
with
the
arms
and
now
thought
myself
pretty
well
freighted
and
began
think
how
should
get
shore
with
them
having
neither
sail
oar
nor
rudder
and
the
least
capful
wind
would
have
overset
all
navigation
had
three
encouragements
smooth
calm
sea
ndly
the
tide
rising
and
setting
the
shore
rdly
what
little
wind
there
was
blew
towards
the
land
and
thus
having
found
two
three
broken
oars
belonging
the
boat
and
besides
the
tools
which
were
the
chest
found
two
saws
axe
and
hammer
with
this
cargo
put
sea
for
mile
thereabouts
raft
went
very
well
only
that
found
drive
little
distant
from
the
place
where
had
landed
before
which
perceived
that
there
was
some
indraft
the
water
and
consequently
hoped
find
some
creek
river
there
which
might
make
use
port
get
land
with
cargo
imagined
was
there
appeared
before
little
opening
the
land
and
found
strong
current
the
tide
set
into
guided
raft
well
could
keep
the
middle
the
stream
but
here
had
like
have
suffered
second
shipwreck
which
had
think
verily
would
have
broken
heart
for
knowing
nothing
the
coast
raft
ran
aground
one
end
upon
shoal
and
not
being
aground
the
other
end
wanted
but
little
that
all
cargo
had
slipped
off
towards
the
end
that
was
afloat
and
fallen
into
the
water
did
utmost
setting
back
against
the
chests
keep
them
their
places
but
could
not
thrust
off
the
raft
with
all
strength
neither
durst
stir
from
the
posture
was
but
holding
the
chests
with
all
might
stood
that
manner
near
half
hour
which
time
the
rising
the
water
brought
little
more
upon
level
and
little
after
the
water
still
rising
raft
floated
again
and
thrust
her
off
with
the
oar
had
into
the
channel
and
then
driving
higher
length
found
myself
the
mouth
little
river
with
land
both
sides
and
strong
current
tide
running
looked
both
sides
for
proper
place
get
shore
for
was
not
willing
driven
too
high
the
river
hoping
time
see
some
ships
sea
and
therefore
resolved
place
myself
near
the
coast
could
length
spied
little
cove
the
right
shore
the
creek
which
with
great
pain
and
difficulty
guided
raft
and
last
got
near
that
reaching
ground
with
oar
could
thrust
her
directly
but
here
had
like
have
dipped
all
cargo
into
the
sea
again
for
that
shore
lying
pretty
steep
that
say
sloping
there
was
place
land
but
where
one
end
float
ran
shore
would
lie
high
and
the
other
sink
lower
before
that
would
endanger
cargo
again
all
that
could
was
wait
till
the
tide
was
the
highest
keeping
the
raft
with
oar
like
anchor
hold
the
side
fast
the
shore
near
flat
piece
ground
which
expected
the
water
would
flow
over
and
did
soon
found
water
enough
for
raft
drew
about
foot
water
thrust
her
upon
that
flat
piece
ground
and
there
fastened
moored
her
sticking
two
broken
oars
into
the
ground
one
one
side
near
one
end
and
one
the
other
side
near
the
other
end
and
thus
lay
till
the
water
ebbed
away
and
left
raft
and
all
cargo
safe
shore
next
work
was
view
the
country
and
seek
proper
place
for
habitation
and
where
stow
goods
secure
them
from
whatever
might
happen
where
was
yet
knew
not
whether
the
continent
island
whether
inhabited
not
inhabited
whether
danger
wild
beasts
not
there
was
hill
not
above
mile
from
which
rose
very
steep
and
high
and
which
seemed
overtop
some
other
hills
which
lay
ridge
from
northward
took
out
one
the
fowling
pieces
and
one
the
pistols
and
horn
powder
and
thus
armed
travelled
for
discovery
the
top
that
hill
where
after
had
with
great
labour
and
difficulty
got
the
top
saw
fate
great
affliction
viz
that
was
island
environed
every
way
with
the
sea
land
seen
except
some
rocks
which
lay
great
way
off
and
two
small
islands
less
than
this
which
lay
about
three
leagues
the
west
found
also
that
the
island
was
was
barren
and
saw
good
reason
believe
uninhabited
except
wild
beasts
whom
however
saw
none
yet
saw
abundance
fowls
but
knew
not
their
kinds
neither
when
killed
them
could
tell
what
was
fit
for
food
and
what
not
coming
back
shot
great
bird
which
saw
sitting
upon
tree
the
side
great
wood
believe
was
the
first
gun
that
had
been
fired
there
since
the
creation
the
world
had
sooner
fired
than
from
all
parts
the
wood
there
arose
innumerable
number
fowls
many
sorts
making
confused
screaming
and
crying
and
every
one
according
his
usual
note
but
not
one
them
any
kind
that
knew
for
the
creature
killed
took
kind
hawk
its
colour
and
beak
resembling
but
had
talons
claws
more
than
common
its
flesh
was
carrion
and
fit
for
nothing
contented
with
this
discovery
came
back
raft
and
fell
work
bring
cargo
shore
which
took
the
rest
that
day
what
with
myself
night
knew
not
nor
indeed
where
rest
for
was
afraid
lie
down
the
ground
not
knowing
but
some
wild
beast
might
devour
though
afterwards
found
there
was
really
need
for
those
fears
however
well
could
barricaded
myself
round
with
the
chest
and
boards
that
had
brought
shore
and
made
kind
hut
for
that
night
lodging
for
food
yet
saw
not
which
way
supply
myself
except
that
had
seen
two
three
creatures
like
hares
run
out
the
wood
where
shot
the
fowl
now
began
consider
that
might
yet
get
great
many
things
out
the
ship
which
would
useful
and
particularly
some
the
rigging
and
sails
and
such
other
things
might
come
land
and
resolved
make
another
voyage
board
the
vessel
possible
and
knew
that
the
first
storm
that
blew
must
necessarily
break
her
all
pieces
resolved
set
all
other
things
apart
till
had
got
everything
out
the
ship
that
could
get
then
called
council
that
say
thoughts
whether
should
take
back
the
raft
but
this
appeared
impracticable
resolved
before
when
the
tide
was
down
and
did
only
that
stripped
before
went
from
hut
having
nothing
but
chequered
shirt
pair
linen
drawers
and
pair
pumps
feet
got
board
the
ship
before
and
prepared
second
raft
and
having
had
experience
the
first
neither
made
this
unwieldy
nor
loaded
hard
but
yet
brought
away
several
things
very
useful
first
the
carpenters
stores
found
two
three
bags
full
nails
and
spikes
great
screw
jack
dozen
two
hatchets
and
above
all
that
most
useful
thing
called
grindstone
all
these
secured
together
with
several
things
belonging
the
gunner
particularly
two
three
iron
crows
and
two
barrels
musket
bullets
seven
muskets
another
fowling
piece
with
some
small
quantity
powder
more
large
bagful
small
shot
and
great
roll
sheet
lead
but
this
last
was
heavy
could
not
hoist
get
over
the
ship
side
besides
these
things
took
all
the
men
clothes
that
could
find
and
spare
fore
topsail
hammock
and
some
bedding
and
with
this
loaded
second
raft
and
brought
them
all
safe
shore
very
great
comfort
was
under
some
apprehension
during
absence
from
the
land
that
least
provisions
might
devoured
shore
but
when
came
back
found
sign
any
visitor
only
there
sat
creature
like
wild
cat
upon
one
the
chests
which
when
came
towards
ran
away
little
distance
and
then
stood
still
she
sat
very
composed
and
unconcerned
and
looked
full
face
she
had
mind
acquainted
with
presented
gun
her
but
she
did
not
understand
she
was
perfectly
unconcerned
nor
did
she
offer
stir
away
upon
which
tossed
her
bit
biscuit
though
the
way
was
not
very
free
for
store
was
not
great
however
spared
her
bit
say
and
she
went
smelled
and
ate
and
looked
pleased
for
more
but
thanked
her
and
could
spare
more
she
marched
off
having
got
second
cargo
shore
though
was
fain
open
the
barrels
powder
and
bring
them
parcels
for
they
were
too
heavy
being
large
casks
went
work
make
little
tent
with
the
sail
and
some
poles
which
cut
for
that
purpose
and
into
this
tent
brought
everything
that
knew
would
spoil
either
with
rain
sun
and
piled
all
the
empty
chests
and
casks
circle
round
the
tent
fortify
from
any
sudden
attempt
either
from
man
beast
when
had
done
this
blocked
the
door
the
tent
with
some
boards
within
and
empty
chest
set
end
without
and
spreading
one
the
beds
upon
the
ground
laying
two
pistols
just
head
and
gun
length
went
bed
for
the
first
time
and
slept
very
quietly
all
night
for
was
very
weary
and
heavy
for
the
night
before
had
slept
little
and
had
laboured
very
hard
all
day
fetch
all
those
things
from
the
ship
and
get
them
shore
had
the
biggest
magazine
all
kinds
now
that
ever
was
laid
believe
for
one
man
but
was
not
satisfied
still
for
while
the
ship
sat
upright
that
posture
thought
ought
get
everything
out
her
that
could
every
day
low
water
went
board
and
brought
away
something
other
but
particularly
the
third
time
went
brought
away
much
the
rigging
could
also
all
the
small
ropes
and
rope
twine
could
get
with
piece
spare
canvas
which
was
mend
the
sails
upon
occasion
and
the
barrel
wet
gunpowder
word
brought
away
all
the
sails
first
and
last
only
that
was
fain
cut
them
pieces
and
bring
much
time
could
for
they
were
more
useful
sails
but
mere
canvas
only
but
that
which
comforted
more
still
was
that
last
all
after
had
made
five
six
such
voyages
these
and
thought
had
nothing
more
expect
from
the
ship
that
was
worth
meddling
with
say
after
all
this
found
great
hogshead
bread
three
large
runlets
rum
spirits
box
sugar
and
barrel
fine
flour
this
was
surprising
because
had
given
over
expecting
any
more
provisions
except
what
was
spoiled
the
water
soon
emptied
the
hogshead
the
bread
and
wrapped
parcel
parcel
pieces
the
sails
which
cut
out
and
word
got
all
this
safe
shore
also
the
next
day
made
another
voyage
and
now
having
plundered
the
ship
what
was
portable
and
fit
hand
out
began
with
the
cables
cutting
the
great
cable
into
pieces
such
could
move
got
two
cables
and
hawser
shore
with
all
the
ironwork
could
get
and
having
cut
down
the
spritsail
yard
and
the
mizzen
yard
and
everything
could
make
large
raft
loaded
with
all
these
heavy
goods
and
came
away
but
good
luck
began
now
leave
for
this
raft
was
unwieldy
and
overladen
that
after
had
entered
the
little
cove
where
had
landed
the
rest
goods
not
being
able
guide
handily
did
the
other
overset
and
threw
and
all
cargo
into
the
water
for
myself
was
great
harm
for
was
near
the
shore
but
cargo
was
great
part
lost
especially
the
iron
which
expected
would
have
been
great
use
however
when
the
tide
was
out
got
most
the
pieces
the
cable
ashore
and
some
the
iron
though
with
infinite
labour
for
was
fain
dip
for
into
the
water
work
which
fatigued
very
much
after
this
went
every
day
board
and
brought
away
what
could
get
had
been
now
thirteen
days
shore
and
had
been
eleven
times
board
the
ship
which
time
had
brought
away
all
that
one
pair
hands
could
well
supposed
capable
bring
though
believe
verily
had
the
calm
weather
held
should
have
brought
away
the
whole
ship
piece
piece
but
preparing
the
twelfth
time
board
found
the
wind
began
rise
however
low
water
went
board
and
though
thought
had
rummaged
the
cabin
effectually
that
nothing
more
could
found
yet
discovered
locker
with
drawers
one
which
found
two
three
razors
and
one
pair
large
scissors
with
some
ten
dozen
good
knives
and
forks
another
found
about
thirty
six
pounds
value
money
some
european
coin
some
brazil
some
pieces
eight
some
gold
and
some
silver
smiled
myself
the
sight
this
money
drug
said
aloud
what
art
thou
good
for
thou
art
not
worth
not
the
taking
off
the
ground
one
those
knives
worth
all
this
heap
have
manner
use
for
thee
remain
where
thou
art
and
the
bottom
creature
whose
life
not
worth
saying
however
upon
second
thoughts
took
away
and
wrapping
all
this
piece
canvas
began
think
making
another
raft
but
while
was
preparing
this
found
the
sky
overcast
and
the
wind
began
rise
and
quarter
hour
blew
fresh
gale
from
the
shore
presently
occurred
that
was
vain
pretend
make
raft
with
the
wind
offshore
and
that
was
business
gone
before
the
tide
flood
began
otherwise
might
not
able
reach
the
shore
all
accordingly
let
myself
down
into
the
water
and
swam
across
the
channel
which
lay
between
the
ship
and
the
sands
and
even
that
with
difficulty
enough
partly
with
the
weight
the
things
had
about
and
partly
the
roughness
the
water
for
the
wind
rose
very
hastily
and
before
was
quite
high
water
blew
storm
but
had
got
home
little
tent
where
lay
with
all
wealth
about
very
secure
blew
very
hard
all
night
and
the
morning
when
looked
out
behold
more
ship
was
seen
was
little
surprised
but
recovered
myself
with
the
satisfactory
reflection
that
had
lost
time
nor
abated
any
diligence
get
everything
out
her
that
could
useful
and
that
indeed
there
was
little
left
her
that
was
able
bring
away
had
had
more
time
now
gave
over
any
more
thoughts
the
ship
anything
out
her
except
what
might
drive
shore
from
her
wreck
indeed
divers
pieces
her
afterwards
did
but
those
things
were
small
use
thoughts
were
now
wholly
employed
about
securing
myself
against
either
savages
any
should
appear
wild
beasts
any
were
the
island
and
had
many
thoughts
the
method
how
this
and
what
kind
dwelling
make
whether
should
make
cave
the
earth
tent
upon
the
earth
and
short
resolved
upon
both
the
manner
and
description
which
may
not
improper
give
account
soon
found
the
place
was
was
not
fit
for
settlement
because
was
upon
low
moorish
ground
near
the
sea
and
believed
would
not
wholesome
and
more
particularly
because
there
was
fresh
water
near
resolved
find
more
healthy
and
more
convenient
spot
ground
consulted
several
things
situation
which
found
would
proper
for
health
and
fresh
water
just
now
mentioned
ndly
shelter
from
the
heat
the
sun
rdly
security
from
ravenous
creatures
whether
man
beast
thly
view
the
sea
that
god
sent
any
ship
sight
might
not
lose
any
advantage
for
deliverance
which
was
not
willing
banish
all
expectation
yet
search
place
proper
for
this
found
little
plain
the
side
rising
hill
whose
front
towards
this
little
plain
was
steep
house
side
that
nothing
could
come
down
upon
from
the
top
the
one
side
the
rock
there
was
hollow
place
worn
little
way
like
the
entrance
door
cave
but
there
was
not
really
any
cave
way
into
the
rock
all
the
flat
the
green
just
before
this
hollow
place
resolved
pitch
tent
this
plain
was
not
above
hundred
yards
broad
and
about
twice
long
and
lay
like
green
before
door
and
the
end
descended
irregularly
every
way
down
into
the
low
ground
the
seaside
was
the
side
the
hill
that
was
sheltered
from
the
heat
every
day
till
came
and
sun
thereabouts
which
those
countries
near
the
setting
before
set
tent
drew
half
circle
before
the
hollow
place
which
took
about
ten
yards
its
semi
diameter
from
the
rock
and
twenty
yards
its
diameter
from
its
beginning
and
ending
this
half
circle
pitched
two
rows
strong
stakes
driving
them
into
the
ground
till
they
stood
very
firm
like
piles
the
biggest
end
being
out
the
ground
above
five
feet
and
half
and
sharpened
the
top
the
two
rows
did
not
stand
above
six
inches
from
one
another
then
took
the
pieces
cable
which
had
cut
the
ship
and
laid
them
rows
one
upon
another
within
the
circle
between
these
two
rows
stakes
the
top
placing
other
stakes
the
inside
leaning
against
them
about
two
feet
and
half
high
like
spur
post
and
this
fence
was
strong
that
neither
man
nor
beast
could
get
into
over
this
cost
great
deal
time
and
labour
especially
cut
the
piles
the
woods
bring
them
the
place
and
drive
them
into
the
earth
the
entrance
into
this
place
made
not
door
but
short
ladder
over
the
top
which
ladder
when
was
lifted
over
after
and
was
completely
fenced
and
fortified
thought
from
all
the
world
and
consequently
slept
secure
the
night
which
otherwise
could
not
have
done
though
appeared
afterwards
there
was
need
all
this
caution
from
the
enemies
that
apprehended
danger
from
into
this
fence
fortress
with
infinite
labour
carried
all
riches
all
provisions
ammunition
and
stores
which
you
have
the
account
above
and
made
large
tent
which
preserve
from
the
rains
that
one
part
the
year
are
very
violent
there
made
double
one
smaller
tent
within
and
one
larger
tent
above
and
covered
the
uppermost
with
large
tarpaulin
which
had
saved
among
the
sails
and
now
lay
more
for
while
the
bed
which
had
brought
shore
but
hammock
which
was
indeed
very
good
one
and
belonged
the
mate
the
ship
into
this
tent
brought
all
provisions
and
everything
that
would
spoil
the
wet
and
having
thus
enclosed
all
goods
made
the
entrance
which
till
now
had
left
open
and
passed
and
repassed
said
short
ladder
when
had
done
this
began
work
way
into
the
rock
and
bringing
all
the
earth
and
stones
that
dug
down
out
through
tent
laid
them
within
fence
the
nature
terrace
that
raised
the
ground
within
about
foot
and
half
and
thus
made
cave
just
behind
tent
which
served
like
cellar
house
cost
much
labour
and
many
days
before
all
these
things
were
brought
perfection
and
therefore
must
back
some
other
things
which
took
some
thoughts
the
same
time
happened
after
had
laid
scheme
for
the
setting
tent
and
making
the
cave
that
storm
rain
falling
from
thick
dark
cloud
sudden
flash
lightning
happened
and
after
that
great
clap
thunder
naturally
the
effect
was
not
much
surprised
with
the
lightning
was
with
the
thought
which
darted
into
mind
swift
the
lightning
itself
powder
very
heart
sank
within
when
thought
that
one
blast
all
powder
might
destroyed
which
not
defence
only
but
the
providing
food
thought
entirely
depended
was
nothing
near
anxious
about
own
danger
though
had
the
powder
took
fire
should
never
have
known
who
had
hurt
such
impression
did
this
make
upon
that
after
the
storm
was
over
laid
aside
all
works
building
and
fortifying
and
applied
myself
make
bags
and
boxes
separate
the
powder
and
keep
little
and
little
parcel
the
hope
that
whatever
might
come
might
not
all
take
fire
once
and
keep
apart
that
should
not
possible
make
one
part
fire
another
finished
this
work
about
fortnight
and
think
powder
which
all
was
about
two
hundred
and
forty
pounds
weight
was
divided
not
less
than
hundred
parcels
the
barrel
that
had
been
wet
did
not
apprehend
any
danger
from
that
placed
new
cave
which
fancy
called
kitchen
and
the
rest
hid
and
down
holes
among
the
rocks
that
wet
might
come
marking
very
carefully
where
laid
the
interval
time
while
this
was
doing
went
out
once
least
every
day
with
gun
well
divert
myself
see
could
kill
anything
fit
for
food
and
near
could
acquaint
myself
with
what
the
island
produced
the
first
time
went
out
presently
discovered
that
there
were
goats
the
island
which
was
great
satisfaction
but
then
was
attended
with
this
misfortune
viz
that
they
were
shy
subtle
and
swift
foot
that
was
the
most
difficult
thing
the
world
come
them
but
was
not
discouraged
this
not
doubting
but
might
now
and
then
shoot
one
soon
happened
for
after
had
found
their
haunts
little
laid
wait
this
manner
for
them
observed
they
saw
the
valleys
though
they
were
upon
the
rocks
they
would
run
away
terrible
fright
but
they
were
feeding
the
valleys
and
was
upon
the
rocks
they
took
notice
from
whence
concluded
that
the
position
their
optics
their
sight
was
directed
downward
that
they
did
not
readily
see
objects
that
were
above
them
afterwards
took
this
method
always
climbed
the
rocks
first
get
above
them
and
then
had
frequently
fair
mark
the
first
shot
made
among
these
creatures
killed
she
goat
which
had
little
kid
her
which
she
gave
suck
which
grieved
heartily
for
when
the
old
one
fell
the
kid
stood
stock
still
her
till
came
and
took
her
and
not
only
but
when
carried
the
old
one
with
upon
shoulders
the
kid
followed
quite
enclosure
upon
which
laid
down
the
dam
and
took
the
kid
arms
and
carried
over
pale
hopes
have
bred
tame
but
would
not
eat
was
forced
kill
and
eat
myself
these
two
supplied
with
flesh
great
while
for
ate
sparingly
and
saved
provisions
bread
especially
much
possibly
could
having
now
fixed
habitation
found
absolutely
necessary
provide
place
make
fire
and
fuel
burn
and
what
did
for
that
and
also
how
enlarged
cave
and
what
conveniences
made
shall
give
full
account
its
place
but
must
now
give
some
little
account
myself
and
thoughts
about
living
which
may
well
supposed
were
not
few
had
dismal
prospect
condition
for
was
not
cast
away
upon
that
island
without
being
driven
said
violent
storm
quite
out
the
course
our
intended
voyage
and
great
way
viz
some
hundreds
leagues
out
the
ordinary
course
the
trade
mankind
had
great
reason
consider
determination
heaven
that
this
desolate
place
and
this
desolate
manner
should
end
life
the
tears
would
run
plentifully
down
face
when
made
these
reflections
and
sometimes
would
expostulate
with
myself
why
providence
should
thus
completely
ruin
his
creatures
and
render
them
absolutely
miserable
without
help
abandoned
entirely
depressed
that
could
hardly
rational
thankful
for
such
life
but
something
always
returned
swift
upon
check
these
thoughts
and
reprove
and
particularly
one
day
walking
with
gun
hand
the
seaside
was
very
pensive
upon
the
subject
present
condition
when
reason
were
expostulated
with
the
other
way
thus
well
you
are
desolate
condition
true
but
pray
remember
where
are
the
rest
you
did
not
you
come
eleven
you
the
boat
where
are
the
ten
why
were
they
not
saved
and
you
lost
why
were
you
singled
out
better
here
there
and
then
pointed
the
sea
all
evils
are
considered
with
the
good
that
them
and
with
what
worse
attends
them
then
occurred
again
how
well
was
furnished
for
subsistence
and
what
would
have
been
case
had
not
happened
which
was
hundred
thousand
one
that
the
ship
floated
from
the
place
where
she
first
struck
and
was
driven
near
the
shore
that
had
time
get
all
these
things
out
her
what
would
have
been
case
had
been
forced
have
lived
the
condition
which
first
came
shore
without
necessaries
life
necessaries
supply
and
procure
them
particularly
said
aloud
though
myself
what
should
have
done
without
gun
without
ammunition
without
any
tools
make
anything
work
with
without
clothes
bedding
tent
any
manner
covering
and
that
now
had
all
these
sufficient
quantity
and
was
fair
way
provide
myself
such
manner
live
without
gun
when
ammunition
was
spent
that
had
tolerable
view
subsisting
without
any
want
long
lived
for
considered
from
the
beginning
how
would
provide
for
the
accidents
that
might
happen
and
for
the
time
that
was
come
even
not
only
after
ammunition
should
spent
but
even
after
health
and
strength
should
decay
confess
had
not
entertained
any
notion
ammunition
being
destroyed
one
blast
mean
powder
being
blown
lightning
and
this
made
the
thoughts
surprising
when
lightened
and
thundered
observed
just
now
and
now
being
about
enter
into
melancholy
relation
scene
silent
life
such
perhaps
was
never
heard
the
world
before
shall
take
from
its
beginning
and
continue
its
order
was
account
the
september
when
the
manner
above
said
first
set
foot
upon
this
horrid
island
when
the
sun
being
its
autumnal
equinox
was
almost
over
head
for
reckoned
myself
observation
the
latitude
nine
degrees
twenty
two
minutes
north
the
line
after
had
been
there
about
ten
twelve
days
came
into
thoughts
that
should
lose
reckoning
time
for
want
books
and
pen
and
ink
and
should
even
forget
the
sabbath
days
but
prevent
this
cut
with
knife
upon
large
post
capital
letters
and
making
into
great
cross
set
the
shore
where
first
landed
came
shore
here
the
september
upon
the
sides
this
square
post
cut
every
day
notch
with
knife
and
every
seventh
notch
was
long
again
the
rest
and
every
first
day
the
month
long
again
that
long
one
and
thus
kept
calendar
weekly
monthly
and
yearly
reckoning
time
the
next
place
are
observe
that
among
the
many
things
which
brought
out
the
ship
the
several
voyages
which
above
mentioned
made
got
several
things
less
value
but
not
all
less
useful
which
omitted
setting
down
before
particular
pens
ink
and
paper
several
parcels
the
captain
mate
gunner
and
carpenter
keeping
three
four
compasses
some
mathematical
instruments
dials
perspectives
charts
and
books
navigation
all
which
huddled
together
whether
might
want
them
also
found
three
very
good
bibles
which
came
cargo
from
england
and
which
had
packed
among
things
some
portuguese
books
also
and
among
them
two
three
popish
prayer
books
and
several
other
books
all
which
carefully
secured
and
must
not
forget
that
had
the
ship
dog
and
two
cats
whose
eminent
history
may
have
occasion
say
something
its
place
for
carried
both
the
cats
with
and
for
the
dog
jumped
out
the
ship
himself
and
swam
shore
the
day
after
went
shore
with
first
cargo
and
was
trusty
servant
many
years
wanted
nothing
that
could
fetch
nor
any
company
that
could
make
only
wanted
have
him
talk
but
that
would
not
observed
before
found
pens
ink
and
paper
and
husbanded
them
the
utmost
and
shall
show
that
while
ink
lasted
kept
things
very
exact
but
after
that
was
gone
could
not
for
could
not
make
any
ink
any
means
that
could
devise
and
this
put
mind
that
wanted
many
things
notwithstanding
all
that
had
amassed
together
and
these
ink
was
one
also
spade
pickaxe
and
shovel
dig
remove
the
earth
needles
pins
and
thread
for
linen
soon
learned
want
that
without
much
difficulty
this
want
tools
made
every
work
did
heavily
and
was
near
whole
year
before
had
entirely
finished
little
pale
surrounded
habitation
the
piles
stakes
which
were
heavy
could
well
lift
were
long
time
cutting
and
preparing
the
woods
and
more
far
bringing
home
that
spent
sometimes
two
days
cutting
and
bringing
home
one
those
posts
and
third
day
driving
into
the
ground
for
which
purpose
got
heavy
piece
wood
first
but
last
bethought
myself
one
the
iron
crows
which
however
though
found
made
driving
those
posts
piles
very
laborious
and
tedious
work
but
what
need
have
been
concerned
the
tediousness
anything
had
seeing
had
time
enough
nor
had
any
other
employment
that
had
been
over
least
that
could
foresee
except
the
ranging
the
island
seek
for
food
which
did
more
less
every
day
now
began
consider
seriously
condition
and
the
circumstances
was
reduced
and
drew
the
state
affairs
writing
not
much
leave
them
any
that
were
come
after
for
was
likely
have
but
few
heirs
deliver
thoughts
from
daily
poring
over
them
and
afflicting
mind
and
reason
began
now
master
despondency
began
comfort
myself
well
could
and
set
the
good
against
the
evil
that
might
have
something
distinguish
case
from
worse
and
stated
very
impartially
like
debtor
and
creditor
the
comforts
enjoyed
against
the
miseries
suffered
thus
evil
good
cast
upon
horrible
but
alive
and
not
drowned
desolate
island

say
giving
over
these
things
began
apply
myself
arrange
way
living
and
make
things
easy
could
have
already
described
habitation
which
was
tent
under
the
side
rock
surrounded
with
strong
pale
posts
and
cables
but
might
now
rather
call
wall
for
raised
kind
wall
against
turfs
about
two
feet
thick
the
outside
and
after
some
time
think
was
year
and
half
raised
rafters
from
leaning
the
rock
and
thatched
covered
with
boughs
trees
and
such
things
could
get
keep
out
the
rain
which
found
some
times
the
year
very
violent
have
already
observed
how
brought
all
goods
into
this
pale
and
into
the
cave
which
had
made
behind
but
must
observe
too
that
first
this
was
confused
heap
goods
which
they
lay
order
they
took
all
place
had
room
turn
myself
set
myself
enlarge
cave
and
work
farther
into
the
earth
for
was
loose
sandy
rock
which
yielded
easily
the
labour
bestowed
and
when
found
was
pretty
safe
beasts
prey
worked
sideways
the
right
hand
into
the
rock
and
then
turning
the
right
again
worked
quite
out
and
made
door
come
out
the
outside
pale
fortification
this
gave
not
only
egress
and
regress
was
back
way
tent
and
storehouse
but
gave
room
store
goods
and
now
began
apply
myself
make
such
necessary
things
found
most
wanted
particularly
chair
and
table
for
without
these
was
not
able
enjoy
the
few
comforts
had
the
world
could
not
write
eat
several
things
with
much
pleasure
without
table
went
work
and
here
must
needs
observe
that
reason
the
substance
and
origin
the
mathematics
stating
and
squaring
everything
reason
and
making
the
most
rational
judgment
things
every
man
may
time
master
every
mechanic
art
had
never
handled
tool
life
and
yet
time
labour
application
and
contrivance
found
last
that
wanted
nothing
but
could
have
made
especially
had
had
tools
however
made
abundance
things
even
without
tools
and
some
with
more
tools
than
adze
and
hatchet
which
perhaps
were
never
made
that
way
before
and
that
with
infinite
labour
for
example
wanted
board
had
other
way
but
cut
down
tree
set
edge
before
and
hew
flat
either
side
with
axe
till
brought
thin
plank
and
then
dub
smooth
with
adze
true
this
method
could
make
but
one
board
out
whole
tree
but
this
had
remedy
for
but
patience
any
more
than
had
for
the
prodigious
deal
time
and
labour
which
took
make
plank
board
but
time
labour
was
little
worth
and
was
well
employed
one
way
another
however
made
table
and
chair
observed
above
the
first
place
and
this
did
out
the
short
pieces
boards
that
brought
raft
from
the
ship
but
when
had
wrought
out
some
boards
above
made
large
shelves
the
breadth
foot
and
half
one
over
another
all
along
one
side
cave
lay
all
tools
nails
and
ironwork
and
word
separate
everything
large
into
their
places
that
might
come
easily
them
knocked
pieces
into
the
wall
the
rock
hang
guns
and
all
things
that
would
hang
that
had
cave
been
seen
looked
like
general
magazine
all
necessary
things
and
had
everything
ready
hand
that
was
great
pleasure
see
all
goods
such
order
and
especially
find
stock
all
necessaries
great
and
now
was
that
began
keep
journal
every
day
employment
for
indeed
first
was
too
much
hurry
and
not
only
hurry
labour
but
too
much
discomposure
mind
and
journal
would
have
been
full
many
dull
things
for
example
must
have
said
thus
after
had
got
shore
and
escaped
drowning
instead
being
thankful
god
for
deliverance
having
first
vomited
with
the
great
quantity
salt
water
which
had
got
into
stomach
and
recovering
myself
little
ran
about
the
shore
wringing
hands
and
beating
head
and
face
exclaiming
misery
and
crying
out
was
undone
undone
till
tired
and
faint
was
forced
lie
down
the
ground
repose
but
durst
not
sleep
for
fear
being
devoured
some
days
after
this
and
after
had
been
board
the
ship
and
got
all
that
could
out
her
yet
could
not
forbear
getting
the
top
little
mountain
and
looking
out
sea
hopes
seeing
ship
then
fancy
vast
distance
spied
sail
please
myself
with
the
hopes
and
then
after
looking
steadily
till
was
almost
blind
lose
quite
and
sit
down
and
weep
like
child
and
thus
increase
misery
folly
but
having
gotten
over
these
things
some
measure
and
having
settled
household
staff
and
habitation
made
table
and
chair
and
all
handsome
about
could
began
keep
journal
which
shall
here
give
you
the
copy
though
will
told
all
these
particulars
over
again

lasted

having
more

september
poor
miserable
robinson
crusoe
being
shipwrecked
during
dreadful
storm
the
offing
came
shore
this
dismal
unfortunate
island
which
called
the
island
despair
all
the
rest
the
ship
company
being
drowned
and
myself
almost
dead
all
the
rest
the
day
spent
afflicting
myself
the
dismal
circumstances
was
brought
viz
had
neither
food
house
clothes
weapon
nor
place
fly
and
despair
any
relief
saw
nothing
but
death
before
either
that
should
devoured
wild
beasts
murdered
savages
starved
death
for
want
food
the
approach
night
slept
tree
for
fear
wild
creatures
but
slept
soundly
though
rained
all
night
october
the
morning
saw
great
surprise
the
ship
had
floated
with
the
high
tide
and
was
driven
shore
again
much
nearer
the
island
which
was
some
comfort
one
hand
for
seeing
her
set
upright
and
not
broken
pieces
hoped
the
wind
abated
might
get
board
and
get
some
food
and
necessaries
out
her
for
relief
the
other
hand
renewed
grief
the
loss
comrades
who
imagined
had
all
stayed
board
might
have
saved
the
ship
least
that
they
would
not
have
been
all
drowned
they
were
and
that
had
the
men
been
saved
might
perhaps
have
built
boat
out
the
ruins
the
ship
have
carried
some
other
part
the
world
spent
great
part
this
day
perplexing
myself
these
things
but
length
seeing
the
ship
almost
dry
went
upon
the
sand

and
then
swam

all
the
goods

got
upon

being
shoal

chiefly
heavy
recovered
many
them
when
the
tide
was
out
oct
rained
all
night
and
all
day
with
some
gusts
wind
during
which
time
the
ship
broke
pieces
the
wind
blowing
little
harder
than
before
and
was
more
seen
except
the
wreck
her
and
that
only
low
water
spent
this
day
covering
and
securing
the
goods
which
had
saved
that
the
rain
might
not
spoil
them

weather
being
excessively
hot
and
then
the
evening
work
again
the
working
part
this
day
and
the
next
were
wholly
employed
making
table
for
was
yet
but
very
sorry
workman
though
time
and
necessity
made
complete
natural
mechanic
soon
after
believe
they
would
any
one
else
nov
this
day
went
abroad
with
gun
and
dog
and
killed
wild
cat
her
skin
pretty
soft
but
her
flesh
good
for
nothing
every
creature
that
killed
took
the
skins
and
preserved
them
coming
back
the
sea
shore
saw
many
sorts
sea
fowls
which
did
not
understand
but
was
surprised
and
almost
frightened
with
two
three
seals
which
while
was
gazing
not
well
knowing
what
they
were
got
into
the
sea
and
escaped
for
that
time
nov
after
morning
walk
went
work
with
table
again
and
finished
though
not
liking
nor
was
long
before
learned
mend
nov
now
began
settled
fair
weather
the
and
part
the
for
the
was
sunday
took
wholly
make
chair
and
with
much
ado
brought
tolerable
shape
but
never
please
and
even
the
making
pulled
pieces
several
times
note
soon
neglected
keeping
sundays
for
omitting
mark
for
them
post
forgot
which
was
which
nov
this
day
rained
which
refreshed
exceedingly
and
cooled
the
earth
but
was
accompanied
with
terrible
thunder
and
lightning
which
frightened
dreadfully
for
fear
powder
soon
was
over
resolved
separate
stock
powder
into
many
little
parcels
possible
that
might
not
danger
nov
these
three
days
spent
making
little
square
chests
boxes
which
might
hold
about
pound
two
pounds
most
powder
and
putting
the
powder
stowed
places
secure
and
remote
from
one
another
possible
one
these
three
days
killed
large
bird
that
was
good
eat
but
knew
not
what
call
nov
this
day
began
dig
behind
tent
into
the
rock
make
room
for
further
conveniency
note
three
things
wanted
exceedingly
for
this
work
viz
pickaxe
shovel
and
wheelbarrow
basket
desisted
from
work
and
began
consider
how
supply
that
want
and
make
some
tools
for
the
pickaxe
made
use
the
iron
crows
which
were
proper
enough
though
heavy
but
the
next
thing
was
shovel
spade
this
was
absolutely
necessary
that
indeed
could
nothing
effectually
without
but
what
kind
one
make
knew
not
nov
the
next
day
searching
the
woods
found
tree
that
wood
like
which
the
brazils
they
call
the
iron
tree
for
its
exceeding
hardness
this
with
great
labour
and
almost
spoiling
axe
cut
piece
and
brought
home
too
with
difficulty
enough
for
was
exceeding
heavy
the
excessive
hardness
the
wood
and
having
other
way
made
long
while
upon
this
machine
for
worked
effectually
little
and
little
into
the
form
shovel
spade
the
handle
exactly
shaped
like
ours
england
only
that
the
board
part
having
iron
shod
upon
bottom
would
not
last
long
however
served
well
enough
for
the
uses
which
had
occasion
put
but
never
was
shovel
believe
made
after
that
fashion
long
making
was
still
deficient
for
wanted
basket
wheelbarrow
basket
could
not
make
any
means
having
such
things
twigs
that
would
bend
make
wicker
ware
least
none
yet
found
out
and
wheelbarrow
fancied
could
make
all
but
the
wheel
but
that
had
notion
neither
did
know
how
about
besides
had
possible
way
make
the
iron
gudgeons
for
the
spindle
axis
the
wheel
run
gave
over
and
for
carrying
away
the
earth
which
dug
out
the
cave
made
thing
like
hod
which
the
labourers
carry
mortar
when
they
serve
the
bricklayers
this
was
not
difficult
the
making
the
shovel
and
yet
this
and
the
shovel
and
the
attempt
which
made
vain
make
wheelbarrow
took
less
than
four
days
mean
always
excepting
morning
walk
with
gun
which
seldom
failed
and
very
seldom
failed
also
bringing
home
something
fit
eat
nov
other
work
having
now
stood
still
because
making
these
tools
when
they
were
finished
went
and
working
every
day
strength
and
time
allowed
spent
eighteen
days
entirely
widening
and
deepening
cave
that
might
hold
goods
commodiously
note
during
all
this
time
worked
make
this
room
cave
spacious
enough
accommodate
warehouse
magazine
kitchen
dining
room
and
cellar
for
lodging
kept
the
tent
except
that
sometimes
the
wet
season
the
year
rained
hard
that
could
not
keep
myself
dry
which
caused
afterwards
cover
all
place
within
pale
with
long
poles

leaning
against
the
rock

load
them
with

lay
still

evening
going
farther
into

hard

accordingly
the
next
day
went
out
with
dog
and
set
him
upon
the
goats
but
was
mistaken
for
they
all
faced
about
upon
the
dog

knew
his
danger
too
well

purposely
omit
what
was
said
the
journal
sufficient
observe
that
was
less
time
than
from
the
january
the
april
working
finishing
and
perfecting
this
wall
though
was
more
than
about
twenty
four
yards
length
being
half
circle
from
one
place
the
rock
another
place
about
eight
yards
from
the
door
the
cave
being
the
centre
behind
all
this
time
worked
very
hard
the
rains
hindering
many
days
nay
sometimes
weeks
together
but
thought
should
never
perfectly
secure
till
this
wall
was
finished
and
scarce
credible
what
inexpressible
labour
everything
was
done
with
especially
the
bringing
piles
out
the
woods
and
driving
them
into
the
ground
for
made
them
much
bigger
than
needed
have
done
when
this
wall
was
finished
and
the
outside
double
fenced
with
turf
wall
raised
close
perceived
myself
that
any
people
were
come
shore
there
they
would
not
perceive
anything
like
habitation
and
was
very
well
did
may
observed
hereafter
upon
very
remarkable
occasion
during
this
time
made
rounds
the
woods
for
game
every
day
when
the
rain
permitted
and
made
frequent
discoveries
these
walks
something
other
advantage
particularly
found
kind
wild
pigeons
which
build
not
wood
pigeons
tree
but
rather
house
pigeons
the
holes
the
rocks
and
taking
some
young
ones
endeavoured
breed
them
tame
and
did
but
when
they
grew
older
they
flew
away
which
perhaps
was
first
for
want
feeding
them
for
had
nothing
give
them
however
frequently
found
their
nests
and
got
their
young
ones
which
were
very
good
meat
and
now
the
managing
household
affairs
found
myself
wanting
many
things
which
thought
first
was
impossible
for
make
indeed
with
some
them
was
for
instance
could
never
make
cask
hooped
had
small
runlet
two
observed
before
but
could
never
arrive
the
capacity
making
one
them
though
spent
many
weeks
about
could
neither
put
the
heads
join
the
staves
true
one
another
make
them
hold
water
gave
that
also
over
the
next
place
was
great
loss
for
candles
that
soon
ever
was
dark
which
was
generally
seven
clock
was
obliged
bed
remembered
the
lump
beeswax
with
which
made
candles
african
adventure
but
had
none
that
now
the
only
remedy
had
was
that
when
had
killed
goat
saved
the
tallow
and
with
little
dish
made
clay
which
baked
the
sun
which
added
wick
some
oakum
made
lamp
and
this
gave
light
though
not
clear
steady
light
like
candle
the
middle
all
labours
happened
that
rummaging
things
found
little
bag
which
hinted
before
had
been
filled
with
corn
for
the
feeding
poultry
not
for
this
voyage
but
before
suppose
when
the
ship
came
from
lisbon
the
little
remainder
corn
that
had
been
the
bag
was
all
devoured
the
rats
and
saw
nothing
the
bag
but
husks
and
dust
and
being
willing
have
the
bag
for
some
other
use
think
was
put
powder
when
divided
for
fear
the
lightning
some
such
use
shook
the
husks
corn
out
one
side
fortification
under
the
rock
was
little
before
the
great
rains
just
now
mentioned
that
threw
this
stuff
away
taking
notice
and
not
much
remembering
that
had
thrown
anything
there
when
about
month
after
thereabouts
saw
some
few
stalks
something
green
shooting
out
the
ground
which
fancied
might
some
plant
had
not
seen
but
was
surprised
and
perfectly
astonished
when
after
little
longer
time
saw
about
ten
twelve
ears
come
out
which
were
perfect
green
barley
the
same
kind
our
european
nay
our
english
barley
impossible
express
the
astonishment
and
confusion
thoughts
this
occasion
had
hitherto
acted
upon
religious
foundation
all
indeed
had
very
few
notions
religion
head
nor
had
entertained
any
sense
anything
that
had
befallen
otherwise
than
chance
lightly
say
what
pleases
god
without
much
inquiring
into
the
end
providence
these
things
his
order
governing
events
for
the
world
but
after
saw
barley
grow
there
climate
which
knew
was
not
proper
for
corn
and
especially
that
knew
not
how
came
there
startled
strangely
and
began
suggest
that
god
had
miraculously
caused
his
grain
grow
without
any
help
seed
sown
and
that
was
directed
purely
for
sustenance
that
wild
miserable
place
this
touched
heart
little
and
brought
tears
out
eyes
and
began
bless
myself
that
such
prodigy
nature
should
happen
upon
account
and
this
was
the
more
strange
because
saw
near
still
all
along
the
side
the
rock
some
other
straggling
stalks
which
proved
stalks
rice
and
which
knew
because
had
seen
grow
africa
when
was
ashore
there
not
only
thought
these
the
pure
productions
providence
for
support
but
not
doubting
that
there
was
more
the
place
went
all
over
that
part
the
island
where
had
been
before
peering
every
corner
and
under
every
rock
see
for
more
but
could
not
find
any
last
occurred
thoughts
that
shook
bag
chickens
meat
out
that
place
and
then
the
wonder
began
cease
and
must
confess
religious
thankfulness
god
providence
began
abate
too
upon
the
discovering
that
all
this
was
nothing
but
what
was
common
though
ought
have
been
thankful
for
strange
and
unforeseen
providence
had
been
miraculous
for
was
really
the
work
providence
that
should
order
appoint
that
ten
twelve
grains
corn
should
remain
unspoiled
when
the
rats
had
destroyed
all
the
rest
had
been
dropped
from
heaven
also
that
should
throw
out
that
particular
place
where
being
the
shade
high
rock
sprang
immediately
whereas
had
thrown
anywhere
else
that
time
had
been
burnt
and
destroyed
carefully
saved
the
ears
this
corn
you
may
sure
their
season
which
was
about
the
end
june
and
laying
every
corn
resolved
sow
them
all
again
hoping
time
have
some
quantity
sufficient
supply
with
bread
but
was
not
till
the
fourth
year
that
could
allow
myself
the
least
grain
this
corn
eat
and
even
then
but
sparingly
shall
say
afterwards
its
order
for
lost
all
that
sowed
the
first
season
not
observing
the
proper
time
for
sowed
just
before
the
dry
season
that
never
came
all
least
not
would
have
done
which
its
place
besides
this
barley
there
were
above
twenty
thirty
stalks
rice
which
preserved
with
the
same
care
and
for
the
same
use
the
same
purpose
make
bread
rather
food
for
found
ways
cook
without
baking
though
did
that
also
after
some
time
but
return
journal
worked
excessive
hard
these
three
four
months
get
wall
done
and
the
april
closed
contriving
into
not
door
but
over
the
wall
ladder
that
there
might
sign
the
outside
habitation
april
finished
the
ladder
went
the
ladder
the
top
and
then
pulled
after
and
let
down
the
inside
this
was
complete
enclosure
for
within
had
room
enough
and
nothing
could
come
from
without
unless
could
first
mount
wall
the
very
next
day
after
this
wall
was
finished
had
almost
had
all
labour
overthrown
once
and
myself
killed
the
case
was
thus
was
busy
the
inside
behind
tent
just
the
entrance
into
cave
was
terribly
frighted
with
most
dreadful
surprising
thing
indeed
for
all
sudden
found
the
earth
come
crumbling
down
from
the
roof
cave
and
from
the
edge
the
hill
over
head
and
two
the
posts
had
set
the
cave
cracked
frightful
manner
was
heartily
scared
but
thought
nothing
what
was
really
the
cause
only
thinking
that
the
top
cave
was
fallen
some
had
done
before
and
for
fear
should
buried
ran
forward
ladder
and
not
thinking
myself
safe
there
neither
got
over
wall
for
fear
the
pieces
the
hill
which
expected
might
roll
down
upon
had
sooner
stepped
ground
than
plainly
saw
was
terrible
earthquake
for
the
ground
stood
shook
three
times
about
eight
minutes
distance
with
three
such
shocks
would
have
overturned
the
strongest
building
that
could
supposed
have
stood
the
earth
and
great
piece
the
top
rock
which
stood
about
half
mile
from
next
the
sea
fell
down
with
such
terrible
noise
never
heard
all
life
perceived
also
the
very
sea
was
put
into
violent
motion
and
believe
the
shocks
were
stronger
under
the
water
than
the
island
was
much
amazed
with
the
thing
itself
having
never
felt
the
like
nor
discoursed
with
any
one
that
had
that
was
like
one
dead
stupefied
and
the
motion
the
earth
made
stomach
sick
like
one
that
was
tossed
sea
but
the
noise
the
falling
the
rock
awakened
were
and
rousing
from
the
stupefied
condition
was
filled
with
horror
and
thought
nothing
then
but
the
hill
falling
upon
tent
and
all
household
goods
and
burying
all
once
and
this
sunk
very
soul
within
second
time
after
the
third
shock
was
over
and
felt
more
for
some
time
began
take
courage
and
yet
had
not
heart
enough
over
wall
again
for
fear
being
buried
alive
but
sat
still
upon
the
ground
greatly
cast
down
and
disconsolate
not
knowing
what
all
this
while
had
not
the
least
serious
religious
thought
nothing
but
the
common
lord
have
mercy
upon
and
when
was
over
that
went
away
too
while
sat
thus
found
the
air
overcast
and
grow
cloudy
would
rain
soon
after
that
the
wind
arose
little
and
little
that
less
than
half
hour
blew
most
dreadful
hurricane
the
sea
was
all
sudden
covered
over
with
foam
and
froth
the
shore
was
covered
with
the
breach
the
water
the
trees
were
torn
the
roots
and
terrible
storm
was
this
held
about
three
hours
and
then
began
abate
and
two
hours
more
was
quite
calm
and
began
rain
very
hard
all
this
while
sat
upon
the
ground
very
much
terrified
and
dejected
when
sudden
came
into
thoughts
that
these
winds
and
rain
being
the
consequences
the
earthquake
the
earthquake
itself
was
spent
and
over
and
might
venture
into
cave
again
with
this
thought
spirits
began
revive
and
the
rain
also
helping
persuade
went
and
sat
down
tent
but
the
rain
was
violent
that
tent
was
ready
beaten
down
with
and
was
forced
into
cave
though
very
much
afraid
and
uneasy
for
fear
should
fall
head
this
violent
rain
forced
new
work
viz
cut
hole
through
new
fortification
like
sink
let
the
water
out
which
would
else
have
flooded
cave
after
had
been
cave
for
some
time
and
found
still
more
shocks
the
earthquake
follow
began
more
composed
and
now
support
spirits
which
indeed
wanted
very
much
went
little
store
and
took
small
sup
rum
which
however
did
then
and
always
very
sparingly
knowing
could
have
more
when
that
was
gone
continued
raining
all
that
night
and
great
part
the
next
day
that
could
not
stir
abroad
but
mind
being
more
composed
began
think
what
had
best
concluding
that
the
island
was
subject
these
earthquakes
there
would
living
for
cave
but
must
consider
building
little
hut
open
place
which
might
surround
with
wall
had
done
here
and
make
myself
secure
from
wild
beasts
men
for
concluded
stayed
where
was
should
certainly
one
time
other
buried
alive
with
these
thoughts
resolved
remove
tent
from
the
place
where
stood
which
was
just
under
the
hanging
precipice
the
hill
and
which
should
shaken
again
would
certainly
fall
upon
tent
and
spent
the
two
next
days
being
the
and
april
contriving
where
and
how
remove
habitation
the
fear
being
swallowed
alive
made
that
never
slept
quiet
and
yet
the
apprehension
lying
abroad
without
any
fence
was
almost
equal
but
still
when
looked
about
and
saw
how
everything
was
put
order
how
pleasantly
concealed
was
and
how
safe
from
danger
made
very
loath
remove
the
meantime
occurred
that
would
require
vast
deal
time
for
this
and
that
must
contented
venture
where
was
till
had
formed
camp
for
myself
and
had
secured
remove
with
this
resolution
composed
myself
for
time
and
resolved
that
would
work
with
all
speed
build
wall
with
piles
and
cables
circle
before
and
set
tent
when
was
finished
but
that
would
venture
stay
where
was
till
was
finished
and
fit
remove
this
was
the
april
the
next
morning
begin
consider
means
put
this
resolve
into
execution
but
was
great
loss
about
tools
had
three
large
axes
and
abundance
hatchets
for
carried
the
hatchets
for
traffic
with
the
indians
but
with
much
chopping
and
cutting
knotty
hard
wood
they
were
all
full
notches
and
dull
and
though
had
grindstone
could
not
turn
and
grind
tools
too
this
cost
much
thought
statesman
would
have
bestowed
upon
grand
point
politics
judge
upon
the
life
and
death
man
length
contrived
wheel
with
string
turn
with
foot
that
might
have
both
hands
liberty
note
had
never
seen
any
such
thing
england
least
not
take
notice
how
was
done
though
since
have
observed
very
common
there
besides
that
grindstone
was
very
large
and
heavy
this
machine
cost
full
week
work
bring
perfection
april
these
two
whole
days
took
grinding
tools
machine
for
turning
grindstone
performing
very
well
april
having
perceived
bread
had
been
low
great
while
now
took
survey
and
reduced
myself
one
biscuit
cake
day
which
made
heart
very
heavy
may
the
morning
looking
towards
the
sea
side
the
tide
being
low
saw
something
lie
the
shore
bigger
than
ordinary
and
looked
like
cask
when
came
found
small
barrel
and
two
three
pieces
the
wreck
the
ship
which
were
driven
shore
the
late
hurricane
and
looking
towards
the
wreck
itself
thought
seemed
lie
higher
out
the
water
than
used
examined
the
barrel
which
was
driven
shore
and
soon
found
was
barrel
gunpowder
but
had
taken
water
and
the
powder
was
caked
hard
stone
however
rolled
farther
shore
for
the
present
and
went
upon
the
sands
near
could
the
wreck
the
ship
look
for
more
chapter
ill
and
conscience
stricken
when
came
down
the
ship
found
strangely
removed
the
forecastle
which
lay
before
buried
sand
was
heaved
least
six
feet
and
the
stern
which
was
broke
pieces
and
parted
from
the
rest
the
force
the
sea
soon
after
had
left
rummaging
her
was
tossed
were
and
cast
one
side
and
the
sand
was
thrown
high
that
side
next
her
stern
that
whereas
there
was
great
place
water
before
that
could
not
come
within
quarter
mile
the
wreck
without
swimming
could
now
walk
quite
her
when
the
tide
was
out
was
surprised
with
this
first
but
soon
concluded
must
done
the
earthquake
and
this
violence
the
ship
was
more
broke
open
than
formerly
many
things
came
daily
shore
which
the
sea
had
loosened
and
which
the
winds
and
water
rolled
degrees
the
land
this
wholly
diverted
thoughts
from
the
design
removing
habitation
and
busied
myself
mightily
that
day
especially
searching
whether
could
make
any
way
into
the
ship
but
found
nothing
was
expected
that
kind
for
all
the
inside
the
ship
was
choked
with
sand
however
had
learned
not
despair
anything
resolved
pull
everything
pieces
that
could
the
ship
concluding
that
everything
could
get
from
her
would
some
use
other
may
began
with
saw
and
cut
piece
beam
through
which
thought
held
some
the
upper
part
quarter
deck
together
and
when
had
cut
through
cleared
away
the
sand
well
could
from
the
side
which
lay
highest
but
the
tide
coming
was
obliged
give
over
for
that
time
may
went
fishing
but
caught
not
one
fish
that
durst
eat
till
was
weary
sport
when
just
going
leave
off
caught
young
dolphin
had
made
long
line
some
rope
yarn
but
had
hooks
yet
frequently
caught
fish
enough
much
cared
eat
all
which
dried
the
sun
and
ate
them
dry
may
worked
the
wreck
cut
another
beam
asunder
and
brought
three
great
fir
planks
off
from
the
decks
which
tied
together
and
made
float
shore
when
the
tide
flood
came
may
worked
the
wreck
got
several
iron
bolts
out
her
and
other
pieces
ironwork
worked
very
hard
and
came
home
very
much
tired
and
had
thoughts
giving
over
may
went
the
wreck
again
not
with
intent
work
but
found
the
weight
the
wreck
had
broke
itself
down
the
beams
being
cut
that
several
pieces
the
ship
seemed
lie
loose
and
the
inside
the
hold
lay
open
that
could
see
into
but
was
almost
full
water
and
sand
may
went
the
wreck
and
carried
iron
crow
wrench
the
deck
which
lay
now
quite
clear
the
water
sand
wrenched
open
two
planks
and
brought
them
shore
also
with
the
tide
left
the
iron
crow
the
wreck
for
next
day
may
went
the
wreck
and
with
the
crow
made
way
into
the
body
the
wreck
and
felt
several
casks
and
loosened
them
with
the
crow
but
could
not
break
them
felt
also
roll
english
lead
and
could
stir
but
was
too
heavy
remove
may
went
every
day
the

for
two
three
hours
till
the
fit
wearing

fell
asleep
and
did
not
wake
till
far
the
night
when
awoke
found
myself
much
refreshed
but
weak
and
exceeding
thirsty
however
had
water
habitation
was
forced
lie
till
morning
and
went
sleep
again
this
second
sleep
had
this
terrible
dream
thought
that
was
sitting
the
ground
the
outside
wall
where
sat
when
the
storm
blew
after
the
earthquake
and
that
saw
man
descend
from
great
black
cloud
bright
flame
fire
and
light
upon
the
ground
was
all
over
bright
flame
that
could
but
just
bear
look
towards
him
his
countenance
was
most
inexpressibly
dreadful
impossible
for
words
describe
when
stepped
upon
the
ground
with
his
feet
thought
the
earth
trembled
just
had
done
before
the
earthquake
and
all
the
air
looked
apprehension
had
been
filled
with
flashes
fire
was
sooner
landed
upon
the
earth
but
moved
forward
towards
with
long
spear
weapon
his
hand
kill
and
when
came
rising
ground
some
distance
spoke
heard
voice
terrible
that
impossible
express
the
terror
all
that
can
say
understood
was
this
seeing
all
these
things
have
not
brought
thee
repentance
now
thou
shalt
die
which
words
thought
lifted
the
spear
that
was
his
hand
kill
one
that
shall
ever
read
this
account
will
expect
that
should
able
describe
the
horrors
soul
this
terrible
vision
mean
that
even
while
was
dream
even
dreamed
those
horrors
nor
any
more
possible
describe
the
impression
that
remained
upon
mind
when
awaked
and
found
was
but
dream
had
alas
divine
knowledge
what
had
received
the
good
instruction
father
was
then
worn
out
uninterrupted
series
for
eight
years
seafaring
wickedness
and
constant
conversation
with
none
but
such
were
like
myself
wicked
and
profane
the
last
degree
not
remember
that
had
all
that
time
one
thought
that
much
tended
either
looking
upwards
towards
god
inwards
towards
reflection
upon
own
ways
but
certain
stupidity
soul
without
desire
good
conscience
evil
had
entirely
overwhelmed
and
was
all
that
the
most
hardened
unthinking
wicked
creature
among
our
common
sailors
can
supposed
not
having
the
least
sense
either
the
fear
god
danger
thankfulness
god
deliverance
the
relating
what
already
past
story
this
will
the
more
easily
believed
when
shall
add
that
through
all
the
variety
miseries
that
had
this
day
befallen
never
had
much
one
thought
being
the
hand
god
that
was
just
punishment
for
sin
rebellious
behaviour
against
father
present
sins
which
were
great
much
punishment
for
the
general
course
wicked
life
when
was
the
desperate
expedition
the
desert
shores
africa
never
had
much
one
thought
what
would
become
one
wish
god
direct
whither
should
keep
from
the
danger
which
apparently
surrounded
well
from
voracious
creatures
cruel
savages
but
was
merely
thoughtless
god
providence
acted
like
mere
brute
from
the
principles
nature
and
the
dictates
common
sense
only
and
indeed
hardly
that
when
was
delivered
and
taken
sea
the
portugal
captain
well
used
and
dealt
justly
and
honourably
with
well
charitably
had
not
the
least
thankfulness
thoughts
when
again
was
shipwrecked
ruined
and
danger
drowning
this
island
was
far
from
remorse
looking
judgment
only
said
myself
often
that
was
unfortunate
dog
and
born
always
miserable
true
when
got
shore
first
here
and
found
all
ship
crew
drowned
and
myself
spared
was
surprised
with
kind
ecstasy
and
some
transports
soul
which
had
the
grace
god
assisted
might
have
come
true
thankfulness
but
ended
where
began
mere
common
flight
joy
may
say
being
glad
was
alive
without
the
least
reflection
upon
the
distinguished
goodness
the
hand
which
had
preserved
and
had
singled
out
preserved
when
all
the
rest
were
destroyed
inquiry
why
providence
had
been
thus
merciful
unto
even
just
the
same
common
sort
joy
which
seamen
generally
have
after
they
are
got
safe
ashore
from
shipwreck
which
they
drown
all
the
next
bowl
punch
and
forget
almost
soon
over
and
all
the
rest
life
was
like
even
when
was
afterwards
due
consideration
made
sensible
condition
how
was
cast
this
dreadful
place
out
the
reach
human
kind
out
all
hope
relief
prospect
redemption
soon
saw
but
prospect
living
and
that
should
not
starve
and
perish
for
hunger
all
the
sense
affliction
wore
off
and
began
very
easy
applied
myself
the
works
proper
for
preservation
and
supply
and
was
far
enough
from
being
afflicted
condition
judgment
from
heaven
the
hand
god
against
these
were
thoughts
which
very
seldom
entered
head
the
growing
the
corn
hinted
journal
had
first
some
little
influence
upon
and
began
affect
with
seriousness
long
thought
had
something
miraculous
but
soon
ever
that
part
the
thought
was
removed
all
the
impression
that
was
raised
from
wore
off
also
have
noted
already
even
the
earthquake
though
nothing
could
more
terrible
its
nature
more
immediately
directing
the
invisible
power
which
alone
directs
such
things
yet
sooner
was
the
first
fright
over
but
the
impression
had
made
went
off
also
had
more
sense
god
his
judgments
much
less
the
present
affliction
circumstances
being
from
his
hand
than
had
been
the
most
prosperous
condition
life
but
now
when
began
sick
and
leisurely
view
the
miseries
death
came
place
itself
before
when
spirits
began
sink
under
the
burden
strong
distemper
and
nature
was
exhausted
with
the
violence
the
fever
conscience
that
had
slept
long
began
awake
and
began
reproach
myself
with
past
life
which
had
evidently
uncommon
wickedness
provoked
the
justice
god
lay
under
uncommon
strokes
and
deal
with
vindictive
manner
these
reflections
oppressed
for
the
second
third
day
distemper
and
the
violence
well
the
fever
the
dreadful
reproaches
conscience
extorted
some
words
from
like
praying
god
though
cannot
say
they
were
either
prayer
attended
with
desires
with
hopes
was
rather
the
voice
mere
fright
and
distress
thoughts
were
confused
the
convictions
great
upon
mind
and
the
horror
dying
such
miserable
condition
raised
vapours
into
head
with
the
mere
apprehensions
and
these
hurries
soul
knew
not
what
tongue
might
express
but
was
rather
exclamation
such
lord
what
miserable
creature
should
sick
shall
certainly
die
for
want
help
and
what
will
become
then
the
tears
burst
out
eyes
and
could
say
more
for
good
while
this
interval
the
good
advice
father
came
mind
and
presently
his
prediction
which
mentioned
the
beginning
this
story
viz
that
did
take
this
foolish
step
god
would
not
bless
and
would
have
leisure
hereafter
reflect
upon
having
neglected
his
counsel
when
there
might
none
assist
recovery
now
said
aloud
dear
father
words
are
come
pass
god
justice
has
overtaken
and
have
none
help
hear
rejected
the
voice
providence
which
had
mercifully
put
posture
station
life
wherein
might
have
been
happy
and
easy
but
would
neither
see
myself
nor
learn
know
the
blessing
from
parents
left
them
mourn
over
folly
and
now
left
mourn
under
the
consequences
abused
their
help
and
assistance
who
would
have
lifted
the
world
and
would
have
made
everything
easy
and
now
have
difficulties
struggle
with
too
great
for
even
nature
itself
support
and
assistance
help
comfort
advice
then
cried
out
lord
help
for
great
distress
this
was
the
first
prayer
may
call
that
had
made
for
many
years
but
return
journal
june
having
been
somewhat
refreshed
with
the
sleep
had
had
and
the
fit
being
entirely
off
got
and
though
the
fright
and
terror
dream
was
very
great
yet
considered
that
the
fit
the
ague
would
return
again
the
next
day
and
now
was
time
get
something
refresh
and
support
myself
when
should
ill
and
the
first
thing
did
filled
large
square
case
bottle
with
water
and
set
upon
table
reach
bed
and
take
off
the
chill
aguish
disposition
the
water
put
about
quarter
pint
rum
into
and
mixed
them
together
then
got
piece
the
goat
flesh
and
broiled
the
coals
but
could
eat
very
little
walked
about
but
was
very
weak
and
withal
very
sad
and
heavy
hearted
under
sense
miserable
condition
dreading
the
return
distemper
the
next
day
night
made
supper
three
the
turtle
eggs
which
roasted
the
ashes
and
ate
call
the
shell
and
this
was
the
first
bit
meat
had
ever
asked
god
blessing
that
could
remember
whole
life
after
had
eaten
tried
walk
but
found
myself
weak
that
could
hardly
carry
gun
for
never
went
out
without
that
went
but
little
way
and
sat
down
upon
the
ground
looking
out
upon
the
sea
which
was
just
before
and
very
calm
and
smooth
sat
here
some
such
thoughts
these
occurred
what
this
earth
and
sea
which
have
seen
much
whence
produced
and
what
and
all
the
other
creatures
wild
and
tame
human
and
brutal
whence
are
sure
are
all
made
some
secret
power
who
formed
the
earth
and
sea
the
air
and
sky
and
who
that
then
followed
most
naturally
god
that
has
made
all
well
but
then
came
strangely
god
has
made
all
these
things
guides
and
governs
them
all
and
all
things
that
concern
them
for
the
power
that
could
make
all
things
must
certainly
have
power
guide
and
direct
them
nothing
can
happen
the
great
circuit
his
works
either
without
his
knowledge
appointment
and
nothing
happens
without
his
knowledge
knows
that
here
and
this
dreadful
condition
and
nothing
happens
without
his
appointment
has
appointed
all
this
befall
nothing
occurred
thought
contradict
any
these
conclusions
and
therefore
rested
upon
with
the
greater
force
that
must
needs
that
god
had
appointed
all
this
befall
that
was
brought
into
this
miserable
circumstance
his
direction
having
the
sole
power
not
only
but
everything
that
happened
the
world
immediately
followed
why
has
god
done
this
what
have
done
thus
used
conscience
presently
checked
that
inquiry
had
blasphemed
and
methought
spoke
like
voice
wretch
dost
thou
ask
what
thou
hast
done
look
back
upon
dreadful
misspent
life
and
ask
thyself
what
thou
hast
not
done
ask
why
that
thou
wert
not
long
ago
destroyed
why
wert
thou
not
drowned
yarmouth
roads
killed
the
fight
when
the
ship
was
taken
the
sallee
man
war
devoured
the
wild
beasts
the
coast
africa
drowned
here
when
all
the
crew
perished
but
thyself
dost
thou
ask
what
have
done
was
struck
dumb
with
these
reflections
one
astonished
and
had
not
word
say
not
answer
myself
but
rose
pensive
and
sad
walked
back
retreat
and
went
over
wall
had
been
going
bed
but
thoughts
were
sadly
disturbed
and
had
inclination
sleep
sat
down
chair
and
lighted
lamp
for
began
dark
now
the
apprehension
the
return
distemper
terrified
very
much
occurred
thought
that
the
brazilians
take
physic
but
their
tobacco
for
almost
all
distempers
and
had
piece
roll
tobacco
one
the
chests
which
was
quite
cured
and
some
also
that
was
green
and
not
quite
cured
went
directed
heaven
doubt
for
this
chest
found
cure
both
for
soul
and
body
opened
the
chest
and
found
what
looked
for
the
tobacco
and
the
few
books
had
saved
lay
there
too
took
out
one
the
bibles
which
mentioned
before
and
which
this
time
had
not
found
leisure
inclination
look
into
say
took
out
and
brought
both
that
and
the
tobacco
with
the
table
what
use
make
the
tobacco
knew
not
distemper
whether
was
good
for
but
tried
several
experiments
with
was
resolved
should
hit
one
way
other
first
took
piece
leaf
and
chewed
mouth
which
indeed
first
almost
stupefied
brain
the
tobacco
being
green
and
strong
and
that
had
not
been
much
used
then
took
some
and
steeped
hour
two
some
rum
and
resolved
take
dose
when
lay
down
and
lastly
burnt
some
upon
pan
coals
and
held
nose
close
over
the
smoke
long
could
bear
well
for
the
heat
almost
for
suffocation
the
interval
this
operation
took
the
bible
and
began
read
but
head
was
too
much
disturbed
with
the
tobacco
bear
reading
least
that
time
only
having
opened
the
book
casually
the
first
words
that
occurred
were
these
call
the
day
trouble
and
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
glorify
these
words
were
very
apt
case
and
made
some
impression
upon
thoughts
the
time
reading
them
though
not
much
they
did
afterwards
for
for
being
delivered
the
word
had
sound
may
say
the
thing
was
remote
impossible
apprehension
things
that
began
say
the
children
israel
did
when
they
were
promised
flesh
eat
can
god
spread
table
the
wilderness
began
say
can
god
himself
deliver
from
this
place
and
was
not
for
many
years
that
any
hopes
appeared
this
prevailed
very
often
upon
thoughts
but
however
the
words
made
great
impression
upon
and
mused
upon
them
very
often
grew
now
late
and
the
tobacco
had
said
dozed
head
much
that
inclined
sleep
left
lamp
burning
the
cave
lest
should
want
anything
the
night
and
went
bed
but
before
lay
down
did
what
never
had
done
all
life
kneeled
down
and
prayed
god
fulfil
the
promise
that
called
upon
him
the
day
trouble
would
deliver
after
broken
and
imperfect
prayer
was
over
drank
the
rum
which
had
steeped
the
tobacco
which
was
strong
and
rank
the
tobacco
that
could
scarcely
get
down
immediately
upon
this
went
bed
found
presently
flew
into
head
violently
but
fell
into
sound
sleep
and

necessarily
near
three

afternoon
the
next
day
nay
this
hour
partly
opinion
that
slept
all
the
next
day
and
night
and
till
almost
three
the
day
after
for
otherwise
know
not
how
should
lose

out
reckoning
the
days
the
week
appeared
some
years
after
had
done
for
had
lost
crossing
and
recrossing
the
line
should
have
lost
more
than
one
day
but
certainly
lost
day
account
and
never
knew
which
way
that
however
one
way
the
other
when
awaked
found
myself
exceedingly
refreshed
and
spirits
lively
and
cheerful
when
got
was
stronger
than
was
the
day
before
and
stomach
better
for
was
hungry
and
short
had
fit
the
next
day
but
continued
much
altered
for
the
better
this
was
the
the
was
well
day
course
and
went
abroad
with
gun
but
did
not
care
travel
too
far
killed
sea
fowl
two
something
like
brandgoose
and
brought
them
home
but
was
not
very
forward
eat
them
ate
some
more
the
turtle
eggs
which
were
very
good
this
evening
renewed
the
medicine
which
had
supposed
did
good
the
day
before
the
tobacco
steeped
rum
only
did
not
take
much
before
nor
did
chew
any
the
leaf
hold
head
over
the
smoke
however
was
not
well
the
next
day
which
was
the
first
july
hoped
should
have
been
for
had
little
spice
the
cold
fit
but
was
not
much
july
renewed
the
medicine
all
the
three
ways
and
dosed
myself
with
first
and
doubled
the
quantity
which
drank
july
missed
the
fit
for
good
and
all
though
did
not
recover
full
strength
for
some
weeks
after
while
was
thus
gathering
strength
thoughts
ran
exceedingly
upon
this
scripture
will
deliver
thee
and
the
impossibility
deliverance
lay
much
upon
mind
bar
ever
expecting
but
was
discouraging
myself
with
such
thoughts
occurred
mind
that
pored
much
upon
deliverance
from
the
main
affliction
that
disregarded
the
deliverance
had
received
and
was
were
made
ask
myself
such
questions
these
viz
have
not
been
delivered
and
wonderfully
too
from
sickness
from
the
most
distressed
condition
that
could
and
that
was
frightful
and
what
notice
had
taken
had
done
part
god
had
delivered
but
had
not
glorified
him
that
say
had
not
owned
and
been
thankful
for
that
deliverance
and
how
could
expect
greater
deliverance
this
touched
heart
very
much
and
immediately
knelt
down
and
gave
god
thanks
aloud
for
recovery
from
sickness
july
the
morning
took
the
bible
and
beginning
the
new
testament
began
seriously
read
and
imposed
upon
myself
read
while
every
morning
and
every
night
not
tying
myself
the
number
chapters
but
long
thoughts
should
engage
was
not
long
after
set
seriously
this
work
till
found
heart
more
deeply
and
sincerely
affected
with
the
wickedness
past
life
the
impression
dream
revived
and
the
words
all
these
things
have
not
brought
thee
repentance
ran
seriously
through
thoughts
was
earnestly
begging
god
give
repentance
when
happened
providentially
the
very
day
that
reading
the
scripture
came
these
words
exalted
prince
and
saviour
give
repentance
and
give
remission
threw
down
the
book
and
with
heart
well
hands
lifted
heaven
kind
ecstasy
joy
cried
out
aloud
jesus
thou
son
david
jesus
thou
exalted
prince
and
saviour
give
repentance
this
was
the
first
time
could
say
the
true
sense
the
words
that
prayed
all
life
for
now
prayed
with
sense
condition
and
true
scripture
view
hope
founded
the
encouragement
the
word
god
and
from
this
time
may
say
began
hope
that
god
would
hear
now
began
construe
the
words
mentioned
above
call
and
will
deliver
thee
different
sense
from
what
had
ever
done
before
for
then
had
notion
anything
being
called
deliverance
but
being
delivered
from
the
captivity
was
for
though
was
indeed
large
the
place
yet
the
island
was
certainly
prison
and
that
the
worse
sense
the
world
but
now
learned
take
another
sense
now
looked
back
upon
past
life
with
such
horror
and
sins
appeared
dreadful
that
soul
sought
nothing
god
but
deliverance
from
the
load
guilt
that
bore
down
all
comfort
for
solitary
life
was
nothing
did
not
much
pray
delivered
from
think
was
all
consideration
comparison
this
and
add
this
part
here
hint
whoever
shall
read
that
whenever
they
come
true
sense
things
they
will
find
deliverance
from
sin
much
greater
blessing
than
deliverance
from
affliction
but
leaving
this
part
return
journal
condition
began
now
though
not
less
miserable
way
living
yet
much
easier
mind
and
thoughts
being
directed
constant
reading
the
scripture
and
praying
god
things
higher
nature
had
great
deal
comfort
within
which
till
now
knew
nothing
also
health
and
strength
returned
bestirred
myself
furnish
myself
with
everything
that
wanted
and
make

employed
walking
about

little
and
little

man
that
was
gathering
his
strength
after
fit
sickness
for
hardly
imagined
how
low
was
and
what
weakness
was
reduced
the
application
which
made
use
was
perfectly
new
and
perhaps
which
had
never
cured
ague
before
neither
can
recommend
any
practise
this
experiment
and
though
did
carry
off
the
fit
yet
rather
contributed
weakening
for
had
frequent
convulsions
nerves
and
limbs
for
some
time
learned
from
also
this
particular
that
being
abroad
the
rainy
season
was
the
most
pernicious
thing
health
that
could

those
rains

came

with
storms
and
hurricanes

for
the
rain
which
came
the
dry

was
almost
always

with

agricultural
experience
had
now
been
this
unhappy
island
above
ten
months
all
possibility
deliverance
from
this
condition
seemed
entirely
taken
from
and
firmly
believe
that
human
shape
had
ever
set
foot
upon
that
place
having
now
secured
habitation
thought
fully
mind
had
great
desire
make
more
perfect
discovery
the
island
and
see
what
other
productions
might
find
which
yet
knew
nothing
was
the
july
that
began
take
more
particular
survey
the
island
itself
went
the
creek
first
where
hinted
brought
rafts
shore
found
after
came
about
two
miles
that
the
tide
did
not
flow
any
higher
and
that
was
more
than
little
brook
running
water
very
fresh
and
good
but
this
being
the
dry
season
there
was
hardly
any
water
some
parts
least
not
enough
run
any
stream
could
perceived
the
banks
this
brook
found
many
pleasant
savannahs
meadows
plain
smooth
and
covered
with
grass
and
the
rising
parts
them
next
the
higher
grounds
where
the
water
might
supposed
never
overflowed
found
great
deal
tobacco
green
and
growing
great
and
very
strong
stalk
there
were
divers
other
plants
which
had
notion
understanding
about
that
might
perhaps
have
virtues
their
own
which
could
not
find
out
searched
for
the
cassava
root
which
the
indians
all
that
climate
make
their
bread
but
could
find
none
saw
large
plants
aloes
but
did
not
understand
them
saw
several
sugar
canes
but
wild
and
for
want
cultivation
imperfect
contented
myself
with
these
discoveries
for
this
time
and
came
back
musing
with
myself
what
course
might
take
know
the
virtue
and
goodness
any
the
fruits
plants
which
should
discover
but
could
bring
conclusion
for
short
had
made
little
observation
while
was
the
brazils
that
knew
little
the
plants
the
field
least
very
little
that
might
serve
any
purpose
now
distress
the
next
day
the
sixteenth
went
the
same
way
again
and
after
going
something
further
than
had
gone
the
day
before
found
the
brook
and
the
savannahs
cease
and
the
country
become
more
woody
than
before
this
part
found
different
fruits
and
particularly
found
melons
upon
the
ground
great
abundance
and
grapes
upon
the
trees
the
vines
had
spread
indeed
over
the
trees
and
the
clusters
grapes
were
just
now
their
prime
very
ripe
and
rich
this
was
surprising
discovery
and
was
exceeding
glad
them
but
was
warned
experience
eat
sparingly
them
remembering
that
when
was
ashore
barbary
the
eating
grapes
killed
several
our
englishmen
who
were
slaves
there
throwing
them
into
fluxes
and
fevers
but
found
excellent
use
for
these
grapes
and
that
was
cure
dry
them
the
sun
and
keep
them
dried
grapes
raisins
are
kept
which
thought
would
indeed
they
were
wholesome
and
agreeable
eat
when
grapes
could
had
spent
all
that
evening
there
and
went
not
back
habitation
which
the
way
was
the
first
night
might
say
had
lain
from
home
the
night
took
first
contrivance
and
got
tree
where
slept
well
and
the
next
morning
proceeded
upon
discovery
travelling
nearly
four
miles
might
judge
the
length
the
valley
keeping
still
due
north
with
ridge
hills
the
south
and
north
side
the
end
this
march
came
opening
where
the
country
seemed
descend
the
west
and
little
spring
fresh
water
which
issued
out
the
side
the
hill
ran
the
other
way
that
due
east
and
the
country
appeared
fresh
green
flourishing
everything
being
constant
verdure
flourish
spring
that
looked
like
planted
garden
descended
little
the
side
that
delicious
vale
surveying
with
secret
kind
pleasure
though
mixed
with
other
afflicting
thoughts
think
that
this
was
all
own
that
was
king
and
lord
all
this
country
indefensibly
and
had
right
possession
and
could
convey
might
have
inheritance
completely
any
lord
manor
england
saw
here
abundance
cocoa
trees
orange
and
lemon
and
citron
trees
but
all
wild
and
very
few
bearing
any
fruit
least
not
then
however
the
green
limes
that
gathered
were
not
only
pleasant
eat
but
very
wholesome
and
mixed
their
juice
afterwards
with
water
which
made
very
wholesome
and
very
cool
and
refreshing
found
now
had
business
enough
gather
and
carry
home
and
resolved
lay
store
well
grapes
limes
and
lemons
furnish
myself
for
the
wet
season
which
knew
was
approaching
order
this
gathered
great
heap
grapes
one
place
lesser
heap
another
place
and
great
parcel
limes
and
lemons
another
place
and
taking
few
each
with
travelled
homewards
resolving
come
again
and
bring
bag
sack
what
could
make
carry
the
rest
home
accordingly
having
spent
three
days
this
journey
came
home
must
now
call
tent
and
cave
but
before
got
thither
the
grapes
were
spoiled
the
richness
the
fruit
and
the
weight
the
juice
having
broken
them
and
bruised
them
they
were
good
for
little
nothing
the
limes
they
were
good
but
could
bring
but
few
the
next
day
being
the
nineteenth
went
back
having
made
two
small
bags
bring
home
harvest
but
was
surprised
when
coming
heap
grapes
which
were
rich
and
fine
when
gathered
them
find
them
all
spread
about
trod
pieces
and
dragged
about
some
here
some
there
and
abundance
eaten
and
devoured
this
concluded
there
were
some
wild
creatures
thereabouts
which
had
done
this
but
what
they
were
knew
not
however
found
there
was
laying
them
heaps
and
carrying
them
away
sack
but
that
one
way
they
would
destroyed
and
the
other
way
they
would
crushed
with
their
own
weight
took
another
course
for
gathered
large
quantity
the
grapes
and
hung
upon
the
out
branches
the
trees
that
they
might
cure
and
dry
the
sun
and
for
the
limes
and
lemons
carried
many
back
could
well
stand
under
when
came
home
from
this
journey
contemplated
with
great
pleasure
the
fruitfulness
that
valley
and
the
pleasantness
the
situation
the
security
from
storms
that
side
the
water
and
the
wood
and
concluded
that
had
pitched
upon
place
fix
abode
which
was
far
the
worst
part
the
country
upon
the
whole
began
consider
removing
habitation
and
looking
out
for
place
equally
safe
where
now
was
situate
possible
that
pleasant
fruitful
part
the
island
this
thought
ran
long
head
and
was
exceeding
fond
for
some
time
the
pleasantness
the
place
tempting
but
when
came
nearer
view
considered
that
was
now
the
seaside
where
was
least
possible
that
something
might
happen
advantage
and
the
same
ill
fate
that
brought
hither
might
bring
some
other
unhappy
wretches
the
same
place
and
though
was
scarce
probable
that
any
such
thing
should
ever
happen
yet
enclose
myself
among
the
hills
and
woods
the
centre
the
island
was
anticipate
bondage
and
render
such
affair
not
only
improbable
but
impossible
and
that
therefore
ought
not
any
means
remove
however
was
enamoured
this
place
that
spent
much
time
there
for
the
whole
the
remaining
part
the
month
july
and
though
upon
second
thoughts
resolved
not
remove
yet
built
little
kind
bower
and
surrounded
distance
with
strong
fence
being
double
hedge
high
could
reach
well
staked
and
filled
between
with
brushwood
and
here
lay
very
secure
sometimes
two
three
nights
together
always
going
over
with
ladder
that
fancied
now
had
country
house
and
sea
coast
house
and
this
work
took
the
beginning
august
had
but
newly
finished
fence
and
began
enjoy
labour
when
the
rains
came
and
made
stick
close
first
habitation
for
though
had
made
tent
like
the
other
with
piece
sail
and
spread
very
well
yet
had
not
the
shelter
hill
keep
from
storms
nor
cave
behind
retreat
into
when
the
rains
were
extraordinary
about
the
beginning
august
said
had
finished
bower
and
began
enjoy
myself
the
august
found
the
grapes
had
hung
perfectly
dried
and
indeed
were
excellent
good
raisins
the
sun
began
take
them
down
from
the
trees
and
was
very
happy
that
did
for
the
rains
which
followed
would
have
spoiled
them
and
had
lost
the
best
part
winter
food
for
had
above
two
hundred
large
bunches
them
sooner
had
taken
them
all
down
and
carried
the
most
them
home
cave
than
began
rain
and
from
hence
which
was
the
august
rained
more
less
every
day
till
the
middle
october
and
sometimes
violently
that
could
not
stir
out
cave
for
several
days
this
season
was
much
surprised
with
the
increase
family
had
been
concerned
for
the
loss
one
cats
who
ran
away
from
thought
had
been
dead
and
heard
more
tidings
her
till
astonishment
she
came
home
about
the
end
august
with
three
kittens
this
was
the
more
strange
because
though
had
killed
wild
cat
called
with
gun
yet
thought
was
quite
different
kind
from
our
european
cats
but
the
young
cats
were
the
same
kind
house
breed
the
old
one
and
both
cats
being
females
thought
very
strange
but
from
these
three
cats
afterwards
came
pestered
with
cats
that
was
forced
kill
them
like
vermin
wild
beasts
and
drive
them
from
house
much
possible
from
the
august
the
incessant
rain
that
could
not
stir
and
was
now
very
careful
not
much
wet
this
confinement
began
straitened
for
food
but
venturing
out
twice
one
day
killed
goat
and
the
last
day
which
was
the
found
very
large
tortoise
which
was
treat
and
food
was
regulated
thus
ate
bunch
raisins
for
breakfast
piece
the
goat
flesh
the
turtle
for
dinner
broiled
for
great
misfortune
had
vessel
boil
stew
anything
and
two
three
the
turtle
eggs
for
supper
during
this
confinement
cover
the
rain
worked
daily
two
three
hours
enlarging
cave
and
degrees
worked
towards
one
side
till
came
the
outside
the
hill
and
made
door
way
out
which
came
beyond
fence
wall
and
came
and
out
this
way
but
was
not
perfectly
easy
lying
open
for
had
managed
myself
before
was
perfect
enclosure
whereas
now
thought
lay
exposed
and
open
for
anything
come
upon
and
yet
could
not
perceive
that
there
was
any
living
thing
fear
the
biggest
creature
that
had
yet
seen
upon
the
island
being
goat
sept
was
now
come
the
unhappy
anniversary
landing
cast
the
notches
post
and
found
had
been
shore
three
hundred
and
sixty
five
days
kept
this
day
solemn
fast
setting
apart
for
religious
exercise
prostrating
myself
the
ground
with
the
most
serious
humiliation
confessing
sins
god
acknowledging
his
righteous
judgments
upon
and
praying
him
have
mercy
through
jesus
christ
and
not
having
tasted
the
least
refreshment
for
twelve
hours
even
till
the
going
down
the
sun
then
ate
biscuit
cake
and
bunch
grapes
and
went
bed
finishing
the
day
began
had
all
this
time
observed
sabbath
day
for
first
had
sense
religion
upon
mind
had
after
some
time
omitted
distinguish
the
weeks
making
longer
notch
than
ordinary
for
the
sabbath
day
and
did
not
really
know
what
any
the
days
were
but
now
having
cast
the
days
above
found
had
been
there
year
divided
into
weeks
and
set
apart
every
seventh
day
for
sabbath
though
found
the
end
account
had
lost
day
two
reckoning
little
after
this
ink
began
fail
and
contented
myself
use
more
sparingly
and
write
down
only
the
most
remarkable
events
life
without
continuing
daily
memorandum
other
things
the
rainy
season
and
the
dry
season
began
now
appear
regular
and
learned
divide
them
provide
for
them
accordingly
but
bought
all
experience
before
had
and
this
going
relate
was
one
the
most
discouraging
experiments
that
made
have
mentioned
that
had
saved
the
few
ears
barley
and
rice
which
had
surprisingly
found
spring
thought
themselves
and
believe
there
were
about
thirty
stalks
rice
and
about
twenty
barley
and
now
thought
proper
time
sow
after
the
rains
the
sun
being
its
southern
position
going
from
accordingly
dug
piece
ground
well
could
with
wooden
spade
and
dividing
into
two
parts
sowed
grain
but
was
sowing
casually
occurred
thoughts
that
would
not
sow
all
first
because
did
not
know
when
was
the
proper
time
for
sowed
about
two
thirds
the
seed
leaving
about
handful
each
was
great
comfort
afterwards
that
did
for
not
one
grain
what
sowed
this
time
came
anything
for
the
dry
months
following
the
earth
having
had
rain
after
the
seed
was
sown
had
moisture
assist
its
growth
and
never
came
all
till
the
wet
season
had
come
again
and
then
grew
had
been
but
newly
sown
finding
first
seed
did
not
grow
which
easily
imagined
was
the
drought
sought
for
moister
piece
ground
make
another
trial
and
dug
piece
ground
near
new
bower
and
sowed
the
rest
seed
february
little
before
the
vernal
equinox
and
this
having
the
rainy
months
march
and
april
water
sprung
very
pleasantly
and
yielded
very
good
crop
but
having
part
the
seed
left
only
and
not
daring
sow
all
that
had
had
but
small
quantity
last
whole
crop
not
amounting
above
half
peck
each
kind
but
this
experiment
was
made
master
business
and
knew
exactly
when
the
proper
season
was
sow
and
that
might
expect
two
seed
times
and
two
harvests
every
year
while
this
corn
was
growing
made
little
discovery
which
was
use
afterwards
soon
the
rains
were
over
and
the
weather
began
settle
which
was
about
the
month
november
made
visit
the
country
bower
where
though
had
not
been
some
months
yet
found
all
things
just
left
them
the
circle
double
hedge
that
had
made
was
not
only
firm
and
entire
but
the
stakes
which
had
cut
out
some
trees
that
grew
thereabouts
were
all
shot
out
and
grown
with
long
branches
much
willow
tree
usually
shoots
the
first
year
after
lopping
its
head
could
not
tell
what
tree
call
that
these
stakes
were
cut
from
was
surprised
and
yet
very
well
pleased
see
the
young
trees
grow
and
pruned
them
and
led
them
grow
much
alike
could
and
scarce
credible
how
beautiful
figure
they
grew
into
three
years
that
though
the
hedge
made
circle
about
twenty
five
yards
diameter
yet
the
trees
for
such
might
now
call
them
soon
covered
and
was
complete
shade
sufficient
lodge
under
all
the
dry
season
this
made
resolve
cut
some
more
stakes
and
make
hedge
like
this
semi
circle
round
wall
mean
that
first
dwelling
which
did
and
placing
the
trees
stakes
double
row
about
eight
yards
distance
from
first
fence
they
grew
presently
and
were
first
fine
cover
habitation
and
afterwards
served
for
defence
also
shall
observe
its
order
found
now
that
the
seasons
the
year
might
generally
divided
not
into
summer
and
winter
europe
but
into
the
rainy
seasons
and
the
dry
seasons
which
were
generally
thus
the
half
february
the
whole
march
and
the
half
april
rainy
the
sun
being
then
near
the
equinox
the
half
april
the
whole
may
june
and
july
and
the
half
august
dry
the
sun
being
then
the
north
the
line
the
half
august
the
whole
september
and
the
half
october
rainy
the
sun
being
then
come
back
the
half
october
the
whole
november
december
and
january
and
the
half
february
dry
the
sun
being
then
the
south
the
line
the
rainy
seasons
sometimes
held
longer
shorter
the
winds
happened
blow
but
this
was
the
general
observation
made
after
had
found
experience
the
ill
consequences
being
abroad
the
rain
took
care
furnish
myself
with
provisions
beforehand
that
might
not
obliged
out
and
sat
within
doors
much
possible
during
the
wet
months
this
time
found
much
employment
and
very
suitable
also
the
time
for
found
great
occasion
for
many
things
which
had
way
furnish
myself
with
but
hard
labour
and
constant
application
particularly
tried
many
ways
make
myself
basket
but
all
the
twigs
could
get
for
the
purpose
proved
brittle
that
they
would
nothing
proved
excellent
advantage
now
that
when
was
boy
used
take
great
delight
standing
basket
maker
the
town
where
father
lived
see
them
make
their
wicker
ware
and
being
boys
usually
are
very
officious
help
and
great
observer
the
manner
which
they
worked
those
things
and
sometimes
lending
hand
had
these
means
full
knowledge
the
methods
and
wanted
nothing
but
the
materials
when
came
into
mind
that
the
twigs
that
tree
from
whence
cut
stakes
that
grew
might
possibly
tough
the
sallows
willows
and
osiers
england
and
resolved
try
accordingly
the
next
day
went
country
house
called
and
cutting
some
the
smaller
twigs
found
them
purpose
much
could
desire
whereupon
came
the
next
time
prepared
with
hatchet
cut
down
quantity
which
soon
found
for
there
was
great
plenty
them
these
set
dry
within
circle
hedge
and
when
they
were
fit
for
use
carried
them
cave
and
here
during
the
next
season
employed
myself
making
well
could
great
many
baskets
both
carry
earth
carry
lay
anything
had
occasion
and
though
did
not
finish
them
very
handsomely
yet
made
them
sufficiently
serviceable
for
purpose
thus
afterwards
took
care
never
without
them
and
wicker
ware
decayed
made
more
especially
strong
deep
baskets
place
corn
instead
sacks
when
should
come
have
any
quantity
having
mastered
this
difficulty
and
employed
world
time
about
bestirred
myself
see
possible
how
supply
two
wants
had
vessels
hold
anything
that
was
liquid
except
two
runlets
which
were
almost
full
rum
and
some
glass
bottles
some
the
common
size
and
others
which
were
case
bottles
square
for
the
holding
water
spirits
had
not
much
pot
boil
anything
except
great
kettle
which
saved
out
the
ship
and
which
was
too
big
for
such
desired
viz
make
broth
and
stew
bit
meat
itself
the
second
thing
fain
would
have
had
was
tobacco
pipe
but
was
impossible
make
one
however
found
contrivance
for
that
too
last
employed
myself
planting
second
rows
stakes
piles
and
this
wicker
working
all
the
summer
dry
season
when
another
business
took
more
time
than
could
imagined
could
spare
chapter
viii
surveys
his
position
mentioned
before
that
had
great
mind
see
the
whole
island
and
that
had
travelled
the
brook
and
where
built
bower
and
where
had
opening
quite
the
sea
the
other
side
the
island
now
resolved
travel
quite
across
the
sea
shore
that
side
taking
gun
hatchet
and
dog
and
larger
quantity
powder
and
shot
than
usual
with
two
biscuit
cakes
and
great
bunch
raisins
pouch
for
store
began
journey
when
had
passed
the
vale
where
bower
stood
above
came
within
view
the
sea
the
west
and
being
very
clear
day
fairly
descried
land
whether
island
continent
could
not
tell
but
lay
very
high
extending
from
the
the
very
great
distance
guess
could
not
less
than
fifteen
twenty
leagues
off
could
not
tell
what
part
the
world
this
might
otherwise
than
that
knew
must
part
america
and
concluded
all
observations
must
near
the
spanish
dominions
and
perhaps
was
all
inhabited
savages
where
had
landed
had
been
worse
condition
than
was
now
and
therefore
acquiesced
the
dispositions
providence
which
began
now
own
and
believe
ordered
everything
for
the
best
say
quieted
mind
with
this
and
left
off
afflicting
myself
with
fruitless
wishes
being
there
besides
after
some
thought
upon
this
affair
considered
that
this
land
was
the
spanish
coast
should
certainly
one
time
other
see
some
vessel
pass
repass
one
way
other
but
not
then
was
the
savage
coast
between
the
spanish
country
and
brazils
where
are
found
the
worst
savages
for
they
are
cannibals
men
eaters
and
fail
not
murder
and
devour
all
the
human
bodies
that
fall
into
their
hands
with
these
considerations
walked
very
leisurely
forward
found
that
side
the
island
where
now
was
much
pleasanter
than
mine
the
open
savannah
fields
sweet
adorned
with
flowers
and
grass
and
full
very
fine
woods
saw
abundance
parrots
and
fain
would
have
caught
one
possible
have
kept
tame
and
taught
speak
did
after
some
painstaking
catch
young
parrot
for
knocked
down
with
stick
and
having
recovered
brought
home
but
was
some
years
before
could
make
him
speak
however
last
taught
him
call
name
very
familiarly
but
the
accident
that
followed
though
trifle
will
very
diverting
its
place
was
exceedingly
diverted
with
this
journey
found
the
low
grounds
hares
thought
them
and
foxes
but
they
differed
greatly
from
all
the
other
kinds
had
met
with
nor
could
satisfy
myself
eat
them
though
killed
several
but
had
need
venturous
for
had
want
food
and
that
which
was
very
good
too
especially
these
three
sorts
viz
goats
pigeons
and
turtle
tortoise
which
added
grapes
leadenhall
market
could
not
have
furnished
table
better
than
proportion
the
company
and
though
case
was
deplorable
enough
yet
had
great
cause
for
thankfulness
that
was
not
driven
any
extremities
for
food
but
had
rather
plenty
even
dainties
never
travelled
this
journey
above
two
miles
outright
day
thereabouts
but
took
many
turns
and
turns
see
what
discoveries
could
make
that
came
weary
enough
the
place
where
resolved
sit
down
all
night
and
then
either
reposed
myself
tree
surrounded
myself
with
row
stakes
set
upright
the
ground
either
from
one
tree
another
wild
creature
could
come
without
waking
soon
came
the
sea
shore
was
surprised
see
that
had
taken
lot
the
worst
side
the
island
for
here
indeed
the
shore
was
covered
with
innumerable
turtles
whereas
the
other
side
had
found
but
three
year
and
half
here
was
also
infinite
number
fowls
many
kinds
some
which
had
seen
and
some
which
had
not
seen
before
and
many
them
very
good
meat
but
such
knew
not
the
names
except
those
called
penguins
could
have
shot
many
pleased
but
was
very
sparing
powder
and
shot
and
therefore
had
more
mind
kill
she
goat
could
which
could
better
feed
and
though
there
were
many
goats
here
more
than
side
the
island
yet
was
with
much
more
difficulty
that
could
come
near
them
the
country
being
flat
and
even
and
they
saw
much
sooner
than
when
was
the
hills
confess
this
side
the
country
was
much
pleasanter
than
mine
but
yet
had
not
the
least
inclination
remove
for
was
fixed
habitation
became
natural
and
seemed
all
the
while
was
here
were
upon
journey
and
from
home
however
travelled
along
the
shore
the
sea
towards
the
east
suppose
about
twelve
miles
and
then
setting
great
pole
upon
the
shore
for
mark
concluded
would
home
again
and
that
the
next
journey
took
should
the
other
side
the
island
east
from
dwelling
and
round
till
came
post
again
took
another
way
come
back
than
that
went
thinking
could
easily
keep
all
the
island
much
view
that
could
not
miss
finding
first
dwelling
viewing
the
country
but
found
myself
mistaken
for
being
come
about
two
three
miles
found
myself
descended
into
very
large
valley
but
surrounded
with
hills
and
those
hills
covered
with
wood
that
could
not
see
which
was
way
any
direction
but
that
the
sun
nor
even
then
unless
knew
very
well
the
position
the
sun
that
time
the
day
happened
further
misfortune
that
the
weather
proved
hazy
for
three
four
days
while
was
the
valley
and
not
being
able
see
the
sun
wandered
about
very
uncomfortably
and
last
was
obliged
find
the
seaside
look
for
post
and
come
back
the
same
way
went
and
then
easy
journeys
turned
homeward
the
weather
being
exceeding
hot
and
gun
ammunition
hatchet
and
other
things
very
heavy
this
journey
dog
surprised
young
kid
and
seized
upon
and
running
take
hold
caught
and
saved
alive
from
the
dog
had
great
mind
bring
home
could
for
had
often
been
musing
whether
might
not
possible
get
kid
two
and
raise
breed
tame
goats
which
might
supply
when
powder
and
shot
should
all
spent
made
collar
for
this
little
creature
and
with
string
which
made
some
rope
yam
which
always
carried
about
led
him
along
though
with
some
difficulty
till
came
bower
and
there
enclosed
him
and
left
him
for
was
very
impatient
home
from
whence
had
been
absent
above
month
cannot
express
what
satisfaction
was
come
into
old
hutch
and
lie
down
hammock
bed
this
little
wandering
journey
without
settled
place
abode
had
been
unpleasant
that
own
house
called
myself
was
perfect
settlement
compared
that
and
rendered
everything
about
comfortable
that
resolved
would
never
great
way
from
again
while
should
lot
stay
the
island
reposed
myself
here
week
rest
and
regale
myself
after
long
journey
during
which
most
the
time
was
taken
the
weighty
affair
making
cage
for
poll
who
began
now
mere
domestic
and
well
acquainted
with
then
began
think
the
poor
kid
which
had
penned
within
little
circle
and
resolved
and
fetch
home
give
some
food
accordingly
went
and
found
where
left
for
indeed
could
not
get
out
but
was
almost
starved
for
want
food
went
and
cut
boughs
trees
and
branches
such
shrubs
could
find
and
threw
over
and
having
fed
tied
did
before
lead
away
but
was
tame
with
being
hungry
that
had
need
have
tied
for
followed
like
dog
and
continually
fed
the
creature
became
loving
gentle
and
fond
that
became
from
that
time
one
domestics
also
and
would
never
leave
afterwards
the
rainy
season
the
autumnal
equinox
was
now
come
and
kept
the
september
the
same
solemn
manner
before
being
the
anniversary
landing
the
island
having
now
been
there
two
years
and
more
prospect
being
delivered
than
the
first
day
came
there
spent
the
whole
day
humble
and
thankful
acknowledgments
the
many
wonderful
mercies
which
solitary
condition
was
attended
with
and
without
which
might
have
been
infinitely
more
miserable
gave
humble
and
hearty
thanks
that
god
had
been
pleased
discover
that
was
possible
might
more
happy
this
solitary
condition
than
should
have
been
the
liberty
society
and
all
the
pleasures
the
world
that
could
fully
make
the
deficiencies
solitary
state
and
the
want
human
society
his
presence
and
the
communications
his
grace
soul
supporting
comforting
and
encouraging
depend
upon
his
providence
here
and
hope
for
his
eternal
presence
hereafter
was
now
that
began
sensibly
feel
how
much
more
happy
this
life
now
led
was
with
all
its
miserable
circumstances
than
the
wicked
cursed
abominable
life
led
all
the
past
part
days
and
now
changed
both
sorrows
and
joys
very
desires
altered
affections
changed
their
gusts
and
delights
were
perfectly
new
from
what
they
were
first
coming
indeed
for
the
two
years
past
before
walked
about
either
hunting
for
viewing
the
country
the
anguish
soul
condition
would
break
out
upon
sudden
and
very
heart
would
die
within
think
the
woods
the
mountains
the
deserts
was
and
how
was
prisoner
locked
with
the
eternal
bars
and
bolts
the
ocean
uninhabited
wilderness
without
redemption
the
midst
the
greatest
composure
mind
this
would
break
out
upon
like
storm
and
make
wring
hands
and
weep
like
child
sometimes
would
take
the
middle
work
and
would
immediately
sit
down
and
sigh
and
look
upon
the
ground
for
hour
two
together
and
this
was
still
worse
for
could
burst
out
into
tears
vent
myself
words
would
off
and
the
grief
having
exhausted
itself
would
abate
but
now
began
exercise
myself
with
new
thoughts
daily
read
the
word
god
and
applied
all
the
comforts
present
state
one
morning
being
very
sad
opened
the
bible
upon
these
words
will
never
never
leave
thee
nor
forsake
thee
immediately
occurred
that
these
words
were
why
else
should
they
directed
such
manner
just
the
moment
when
was
mourning
over
condition
one
forsaken
god
and
man
well
then
said
god
does
not
forsake
what
ill
consequence
can
what
matters
though
the
world
should
all
forsake
seeing
the
other
hand
had
all
the
world
and
should
lose
the
favour
and
blessing
god
there
would
comparison
the
loss
from
this
moment
began
conclude
mind
that
was
possible
for
more
happy
this
forsaken
solitary
condition
than
was
probable
should
ever
have
been
any
other
particular
state
the
world
and
with
this
thought
was
going
give
thanks
god
for
bringing
this
place
know
not
what
was
but
something
shocked
mind
that
thought
and
durst
not
speak
the
words
how
canst
thou
become
such
hypocrite
said
even
audibly
pretend
thankful
for
condition
which
however
thou
mayest
endeavour
contented
with
thou
wouldst
rather
pray
heartily
delivered
from
stopped
there
but
though
could
not
say
thanked
god
for
being
there
yet
sincerely
gave
thanks
god
for
opening
eyes
whatever
afflicting
providences
see
the
former
condition
life
and
mourn
for
wickedness
and
repent
never
opened
the
bible
shut
but
very
soul
within
blessed
god
for
directing
friend
england
without
any
order
mine
pack
among
goods
and
for
assisting
afterwards
save
out
the
wreck
the
ship
thus
and
this
disposition
mind
began
third
year
and
though
have
not
given
the
reader
the
trouble
particular
account
works
this
year
the
first
yet
general
may
observed
that
was
very
seldom
idle
but
having
regularly
divided
time
according
the
several
daily
employments
that
were
before
such
first
duty
god
and
the
reading
the
scriptures
which
constantly
set
apart
some
time
for
thrice
every
day
secondly
the
going
abroad
with
gun
for
food
which
generally
took
three
hours
every
morning
when
did
not
rain
thirdly
the
ordering
cutting
preserving
and
cooking
what
had
killed
caught
for
supply
these
took
great
part
the
day
also
considered
that
the
middle
the
day
when
the
sun
was
the
zenith
the
violence
the
heat
was
too
great
stir
out
that
about
four
hours
the
evening
was
all
the
time
could
supposed
work
with
this
exception
that
sometimes
changed
hours
hunting
and
working
and
went
work
the
morning
and
abroad
with
gun
the
afternoon
this
short
time
allowed
for
labour
desire
may
added
the
exceeding
laboriousness
work
the
many
hours
which
for
want
tools
want
help
and
want
skill
everything
did
took
out
time
for
example
was
full
two
and
forty
days
making
board
for
long
shelf
which
wanted
cave
whereas
two
sawyers
with
their
tools
and
saw
pit
would
have
cut
six
them
out
the
same
tree
half
day
case
was
this
was
large
tree
which
was
cut
down
because
board
was
broad
one
this
tree
was
three
days
cutting
down
and
two
more
cutting
off
the
boughs
and
reducing
log
piece
timber
with
inexpressible
hacking
and
hewing
reduced
both
the
sides
into
chips
till
began
light
enough
move
then
turned
and
made
one
side
smooth
and
flat
board
from
end
end
then
turning
that
side
downward
cut
the
other
side
til
brought
the
plank
about
three
inches
thick
and
smooth
both
sides
any
one
may
judge
the
labour
hands
such
piece
work
but
labour
and
patience
carried
through
that
and
many
other
things
only
observe
this
particular
show
the
reason
why
much
time
went
away
with
little
work
viz
that
what
might
little
done
with
help
and
tools
was
vast
labour
and
required
prodigious
time
alone
and
hand
but
notwithstanding
this
with
patience
and
labour
got
through
everything
that
circumstances
made
necessary
will
appear
what
follows
was
now
the
months
november
and
december
expecting
crop
barley
and
rice
the
ground
had
manured
and
dug
for
them
was
not
great
for
observed
seed
each
was
not
above
the
quantity
half
peck
for
had
lost
one
whole
crop
sowing
the
dry
season
but
now
crop
promised
very
well
when
sudden
found
was
danger
losing
all
again
enemies
several
sorts
which
was
scarcely
possible
keep
from
first
the
goats
and
wild
creatures
which
called
hares
who
tasting
the
sweetness
the
blade
lay
night
and
day
soon
came
and
eat
close
that
could
get
time
shoot
into
stalk
this
saw
remedy
for
but
making
enclosure
about
with
hedge
which
did
with
great
deal
toil
and
the
more
because
required
speed
however
arable
land
was
but
small
suited
crop
got
totally
well
fenced
about
three
weeks
time
and
shooting
some
the
creatures
the
daytime
set
dog
guard
the
night
tying
him
stake
the
gate
where
would
stand
and
bark
all
night
long
little
time
the
enemies
forsook
the
place
and
the
corn
grew
very
strong
and
well
and
began
ripen
apace
but
the
beasts
ruined
before
while
corn
was
the
blade
the
birds
were
likely
ruin
now
when
was
the
ear
for
going
along
the
place
see
how
throve
saw
little
crop
surrounded
with
fowls
know
not
how
many
sorts
who
stood
were
watching
till
should
gone
immediately
let
fly
among
them
for
always
had
gun
with
had
sooner
shot
but
there
rose
little
cloud
fowls
which
had
not
seen
all
from
among
the
corn
itself
this
touched
sensibly
for
foresaw
that
few
days
they
would
devour
all
hopes
that
should
starved
and
never
able
raise
crop
all
and
what
could
not
tell
however
resolved
not
lose
corn
possible
though
should
watch
night
and
day
the
first
place
went
among
see
what
damage
was
already
done
and
found
they
had
spoiled
good
deal
but
that
was
yet
too
green
for
them
the
loss
was
not
great
but
that
the
remainder
was
likely
good
crop
could
saved
stayed
load
gun
and
then
coming
away
could
easily
see
the
thieves
sitting
upon
all
the
trees
about
they
only
waited
till
was
gone
away
and
the
event
proved
for
walked
off
was
gone
was
sooner
out
their
sight
than
they
dropped
down
one
one
into
the
corn
again
was
provoked
that
could
not
have
patience
stay
till
more
came
knowing
that
every
grain
that
they
ate
now
was
might
said
peck
loaf
the
consequence
but
coming
the
hedge
fired
again
and
killed
three
them
this
was
what
wished
for
took
them
and
served
them
serve
notorious
thieves
england
hanged
them
chains
for
terror
others
impossible
imagine
that
this
should
have
such
effect
had
for
the
fowls
would
not
only
not
come
the
corn
but
short
they
forsook
all
that
part
the
island
and
could
never
see
bird
near
the
place
long
scarecrows
hung
there
this
was
very
glad
you
may
sure
and
about
the
latter
end
december
which
was
our
second
harvest
the
year
reaped
corn
was
sadly
put
for
scythe
sickle
cut
down
and
all
could
was
make
one
well
could
out
one
the
broadswords
cutlasses
which
saved
among
the
arms
out
the
ship
however
first
crop
was
but
small
had
great
difficulty
cut
down
short
reaped
way
for
cut
nothing
off
but
the
ears
and
carried
away
great
basket
which
had
made
and
rubbed
out
with
hands
and
the
end
all
harvesting
found
that
out
half
peck
seed
had
near
two
bushels
rice
and
about
two
bushels
and
half
barley
that
say
guess
for
had
measure
that
time
however
this
was
great
encouragement
and
foresaw
that
time
would
please
god
supply
with
bread
and
yet
here
was
perplexed
again
for
neither
knew
how
grind
make
meal
corn
indeed
how
clean
and
part
nor
made
into
meal
how
make
bread
and
how
make
yet
knew
not
how
bake
these
things
being
added
desire
having
good
quantity
for
store
and
secure
constant
supply
resolved
not
taste
any
this
crop
but
preserve
all
for
seed
against
the
next
season
and
the
meantime
employ
all
study
and
hours
working
accomplish
this
great
work
providing
myself
with
corn
and
bread
might
truly
said
that
now
worked
for
bread
believe
few
people
have
thought
much
upon
the
strange
multitude
little
things
necessary
the
providing
producing
curing
dressing
making
and
finishing
this
one
article
bread
that
was
reduced
mere
state
nature
found
this
daily
discouragement
and
was
made
more
sensible
every
hour
even
after
had
got
the
first
handful
seed
corn
which
have
said
came
unexpectedly
and
indeed
surprise
first
had
plough
turn
the
earth
spade
shovel
dig
well
this
conquered
making
wooden
spade
observed
before
but
this
did
work
but
wooden
manner
and
though
cost
great
many
days
make
yet
for
want
iron
not
only
wore
out
soon
but
made
work
the
harder
and
made
performed
much
worse
however
this
bore
with
and
was
content
work
out
with
patience
and
bear
with
the
badness
the
performance
when
the
corn
was
sown
had
harrow
but
was
forced
over
myself
and
drag
great
heavy
bough
tree
over
scratch
may
called
rather
than
rake
harrow
when
was
growing
and
grown
have
observed
already
how
many
things
wanted
fence
secure
mow
reap
cure
and
carry
home
thrash
part
from
the
chaff
and
save
then
wanted
mill
grind
sieves
dress
yeast
and
salt
make
into
bread
and
oven
bake
but
all
these
things
did
without
shall
observed
and
yet
the
corn
was
inestimable
comfort
and
advantage
too
all
this
said
made
everything
laborious
and
tedious
but
that
there
was
help
for
neither
was
time
much
loss
because
had
divided
certain
part
was
every
day
appointed
these
works
and
had
resolved
use
none
the
corn
for
bread
till
had
greater
quantity
had
the
next
six
months
apply
myself
wholly
labour
and
invention
furnish
myself
with
utensils
proper
for
the
performing
all
the
operations
necessary
for
making
the
corn
when
had
fit
for
use
chapter
boat
but
first
was
prepare
more
land
for
had
now
seed
enough
sow
above
acre
ground
before
did
this
had
week
work
least
make
spade
which
when
was
done
was
but
sorry
one
indeed
and
very
heavy
and
required
double
labour
work
with
however
got
through
that
and
sowed
seed
two
large
flat
pieces
ground
near
house
could
find
them
mind
and
fenced
them
with
good
hedge
the
stakes
which
were
all
cut
off
that
wood
which
had
set
before
and
knew
would
grow
that
year
time
knew
should
have
quick
living
hedge
that
would
want
but
little
repair
this
work
did
not
take
less
than
three
months
because
great
part
that
time
was
the
wet
season
when
could
not
abroad
within
doors
that
when
rained
and
could
not
out
found
employment
the
following
occupations
always
observing
that
all
the
while
was
work
diverted
myself
with
talking
parrot
and
teaching
him
speak
and
quickly
taught
him
know
his
own
name
and
last
speak
out
pretty
loud
poll
which
was
the
first
word
ever
heard
spoken
the
island
any
mouth
but
own
this
therefore
was
not
work
but
assistance
work
for
now
said
had
great
employment
upon
hands
follows
had
long
studied
make
some
means
other
some
earthen
vessels
which
indeed
wanted
sorely
but
knew
not
where
come
them
however
considering
the
heat
the
climate
did
not
doubt
but
could
find
out
any
clay
might
make
some
pots
that
might
being
dried
the
sun
hard
enough
and
strong
enough
bear
handling
and
hold
anything
that
was
dry
and
required
kept
and
this
was
necessary
the
preparing
corn
meal
which
was
the
thing
was
doing
resolved
make
some
large
could
and
fit
only
stand
like
jars
hold
what
should
put
into
them
would
make
the
reader
pity
rather
laugh
tell
how
many
awkward
ways
took
raise
this
paste
what
odd
misshapen
ugly
things
made
how
many
them
fell
and
how
many
fell
out
the
clay
not
being
stiff
enough
bear
its
own
weight
how
many
cracked
the
over
violent
heat
the
sun
being
set
out
too
hastily
and
how
many
fell
pieces
with
only
removing
well
before
after
they
were
dried
and
word
how
after
having
laboured
hard
find
the
clay
dig
temper
bring
home
and
work
could
not
make
above
two
large
earthen
ugly
things
cannot
call
them
jars
about
two
months
labour
however
the
sun
baked
these
two
very
dry
and
hard
lifted
them
very
gently
and
set
them
down
again
two
great
wicker
baskets
which
had
made
purpose
for
them
that
they
might
not
break
and
between
the
pot
and
the
basket
there
was
little
room
spare
stuffed
full
the
rice
and
barley
straw
and
these
two
pots
being
stand
always
dry
thought
would
hold
dry
corn
and
perhaps
the
meal
when
the
corn
was
bruised
though
miscarried
much
design
for
large
pots
yet
made
several
smaller
things
with
better
success
such
little
round
pots
flat
dishes
pitchers
and
pipkins
and
any
things
hand
turned
and
the
heat
the
sun
baked
them
quite
hard
but
all
this
would
not
answer
end
which
was
get
earthen
pot
hold
what
was
liquid
and
bear
the
fire
which
none
these
could
happened
after
some
time
making
pretty
large
fire
for
cooking
meat
when
went
put
out
after
had
done
with
found
broken
piece
one
earthenware
vessels
the
fire
burnt
hard
stone
and
red
tile
was
agreeably
surprised
see
and
said
myself
that
certainly
they
might
made
burn
whole
they
would
burn
broken
this
set
study
how
order
fire
make
burn
some
pots
had
notion
kiln
such
the
potters
burn
glazing
them
with
lead
though
had
some
lead
with
but
placed
three
large
pipkins
and
two
three
pots
pile
one
upon
another
and
placed
firewood
all
round
with
great
heap
embers
under
them
plied
the
fire
with
fresh
fuel
round
the
outside
and
upon
the
top
till
saw
the
pots
the
inside
red
hot
quite
through
and
observed
that
they
did
not
crack
all
when
saw
them
clear
red
let
them
stand
that
heat
about
five
six
hours
till
found
one
them
though
did
not
crack
did
melt
run
for
the
sand
which
was
mixed
with
the
clay
melted
the
violence
the
heat
and
would
have
run
into
glass
had
gone
slacked
fire
gradually
till
the
pots
began
abate
the
red
colour
and
watching
them
all
night
that
might
not
let
the
fire
abate
too
fast
the
morning
had
three
very
good
will
not
say
handsome
pipkins
and
two
other
earthen
pots
hard
burnt
could
desired
and
one
them
perfectly
glazed
with
the
running
the
sand
after
this
experiment
need
not
say
that
wanted
sort
earthenware
for
use
but
must
needs
say
the
shapes
them
they
were
very
indifferent
any
one
may
suppose
when
had
way
making
them
but
the
children
make
dirt
pies
woman
would
make
pies
that
never
learned
raise
paste
joy
thing
mean
nature
was
ever
equal
mine
when
found
had
made
earthen
pot
that
would
bear
the
fire
and
had
hardly
patience
stay
till
they
were
cold
before
set
one
the
fire
again
with
some
water
boil
some
meat
which
did
admirably
well
and
with
piece
kid
made
some
very
good
broth
though
wanted
oatmeal
and
several
other
ingredients
requisite
make
good
would
have
had
been
next
concern
was
get
stone
mortar
stamp
beat
some
corn
for
the
mill
there
was
thought
arriving
that
perfection
art
with
one
pair
hands
supply
this
want
was
great
loss
for
all
the
trades
the
world
was
perfectly
unqualified
for
stone
cutter
for
any
whatever
neither
had
any
tools
about
with
spent
many
day
find
out
great
stone
big
enough
cut
hollow
and
make
fit
for
mortar
and
could
find
none
all
except
what
was
the
solid
rock
and
which
had
way
dig
cut
out
nor
indeed
were
the
rocks
the
island
hardness
sufficient
but
were
all
sandy
crumbling
stone
which
neither
would
bear
the
weight
heavy
pestle
nor
would
break
the
corn
without
filling
with
sand
after
great
deal
time
lost
searching
for
stone
gave
over
and
resolved
look
out
for
great
block
hard
wood
which
found
indeed
much
easier
and
getting
one
big
had
strength
stir
rounded
and
formed
the
outside
with
axe
and
hatchet
and
then
with
the
help
fire
and
infinite
labour
made
hollow
place
the
indians
brazil
make
their
canoes
after
this
made
great
heavy
pestle
beater
the
wood
called
the
iron
wood
and
this
prepared
and
laid
against
had
next
crop
corn
which
proposed
myself
grind
rather
pound
into
meal
make
bread
next
difficulty
was
make
sieve
searce
dress
meal
and
part
from
the
bran
and
the
husk
without
which
did
not
see
possible
could
have
any
bread
this
was
most
difficult
thing
even
think
for
sure
had
nothing
like
the
necessary
thing
make
mean
fine
thin
canvas
stuff
searce
the
meal
through
and
here
was
full
stop
for
many
months
nor
did
really
know
what
linen
had
none
left
but
what
was
mere
rags
had
goat
hair
but
neither
knew
how
weave
spin
and
had
known
how
here
were
tools
work
with
all
the
remedy
that
found
for
this
was
that
last
did
remember
had
among
the
seamen
clothes
which
were
saved
out
the
ship
some
neckcloths
calico
muslin
and
with
some
pieces
these
made
three
small
sieves
proper
enough
for
the
work
and
thus
made
shift
for
some
years
how
did
afterwards
shall
show
its
place
the
baking
part
was
the
next
thing
considered
and
how
should
make
bread
when
came
have
corn
for
first
had
yeast
that
part
there
was
supplying
the
want
did
not
concern
myself
much
about
but
for
oven
was
indeed
great
pain
length
found
out
experiment
for
that
also
which
was
this
made
some
earthen
vessels
very
broad
but
not
deep
that
say
about
two
feet
diameter
and
not
above
nine
inches
deep
these
burned
the
fire
had
done
the
other
and
laid
them
and
when
wanted
bake
made
great
fire
upon
hearth
which
had
paved
with
some
square
tiles
own
baking
and
burning
also
but
should
not
call
them
square
when
the
firewood
was
burned
pretty
much
into
embers
live
coals
drew
them
forward
upon
this
hearth
cover
all
over
and
there
let
them
lie
till
the
hearth
was
very
hot
then
sweeping
away
all
the
embers
set
down
loaf
loaves
and
whelming
down
the
earthen
pot
upon
them
drew
the
embers
all
round
the
outside
the
pot
keep
and
add
the
heat
and
thus
well
the
best
oven
the
world
baked
barley
loaves
and
became
little
time
good
pastrycook
into
the
bargain
for
made
myself
several
cakes
and
puddings
the
rice
but
made
pies
neither
had
anything
put
into
them
supposing
had
except
the
flesh
either
fowls
goats
need
not
wondered
all
these
things
took
most
part
the
third
year
abode
here
for
observed
that
the
intervals
these
things
had
new
harvest
and
husbandry
manage
for
reaped
corn
its
season
and
carried
home
well
could
and
laid
the
ear
large
baskets
till
had
time
rub
out
for
had
floor
thrash
instrument
thrash
with
and
now
indeed
stock
corn
increasing
really
wanted
build
barns
bigger
wanted
place
lay
for
the
increase
the
corn
now
yielded
much
that
had
the
barley
about
twenty
bushels
and
the
rice
much
more
insomuch
that
now
resolved
begin
use
freely
for
bread
had
been
quite
gone
great
while
also
resolved
see
what
quantity
would
sufficient
for
whole
year
and
sow
but
once
year
upon
the
whole
found
that
the
forty
bushels
barley
and
rice
were
much
more
than
could
consume
year
resolved
sow
just
the
same
quantity
every
year
that
sowed
the
last
hopes
that
such
quantity
would
fully
provide
with
bread
all
the
while
these
things
were
doing
you
may
sure
thoughts
ran
many
times
upon
the
prospect
land
which
had
seen
from
the
other
side
the
island
and
was
not
without
secret
wishes
that
were
shore
there
fancying
that
seeing
the
mainland
and
inhabited
country
might
find
some
way
other
convey
myself
further
and
perhaps
last
find
some
means
escape
but
all
this
while
made
allowance
for
the
dangers
such
undertaking
and
how
might
fall
into
the
hands
savages
and
perhaps
such
might
have
reason
think
far
worse
than
the
lions
and
tigers
africa
that
once
came
their
power
should
run
hazard
more
than
thousand
one
being
killed
and
perhaps
being
eaten
for
had
heard
that
the
people
the
caribbean
coast
were
cannibals
man
eaters
and
knew
the
latitude
that
could
not
far
from
that
shore
then
supposing
they
were
not
cannibals
yet
they
might
kill
many
europeans
who
had
fallen
into
their
hands
had
been
served
even
when
they
had
been
ten
twenty
together
much
more
that
was
but
one
and
could
make
little
defence
all
these
things
say
which
ought
have
considered
well
and
did
come
into
thoughts
afterwards
yet
gave
apprehensions
first
and
head
ran
mightily
upon
the
thought
getting
over
the
shore
now
wished
for
boy
xury
and
the
long
boat
with
shoulder
mutton
sail
with
which
sailed
above
thousand
miles
the
coast
africa
but
this
was
vain
then
thought
would
and
look
our
ship
boat
which
have
said
was
blown
upon
the
shore
great
way
the
storm
when
were
first
cast
away
she
lay
almost
where
she
did
first
but
not
quite
and
was
turned
the
force
the
waves
and
the
winds
almost
bottom
upward
against
high
ridge
beachy
rough
sand
but
water
about
her
had
had
hands
have
refitted
her
and
have
launched
her
into
the
water
the
boat
would
have
done
well
enough
and
might
have
gone
back
into
the
brazils
with
her
easily
enough
but
might
have
foreseen
that
could
more
turn
her
and
set
her
upright
upon
her
bottom
than
could
remove
the
island
however
went
the
woods
and
cut
levers
and
rollers
and
brought
them
the
boat
resolving
try
what
could
suggesting
myself
that
could
but
turn
her
down
might
repair
the
damage
she
had
received
and
she
would
very
good
boat
and
might
sea
her
very
easily
spared
pains
indeed
this
piece
fruitless
toil
and
spent
think
three
four
weeks
about
last
finding
impossible
heave
with
little
strength
fell
digging
away
the
sand
undermine
and
make
fall
down
setting
pieces
wood
thrust
and
guide
right
the
fall
but
when
had
done
this
was
unable
stir
again
get
under
much
less
move
forward
towards
the
water
was
forced
give
over
and
yet
though
gave
over
the
hopes
the
boat
desire
venture
over
for
the
main
increased
rather
than
decreased
the
means
for
seemed
impossible
this
length
put
upon
thinking
whether
was
not
possible
make
myself
canoe
periagua
such
the
natives
those
climates
make
even
without
tools
might
say
without
hands
the
trunk
great
tree
this
not
only
thought
possible
but
easy
and
pleased
myself
extremely
with
the
thoughts
making
and
with
having
much
more
convenience
for
than
any
the
negroes
indians
but
not
all
considering
the
particular
inconveniences
which
lay
under
more
than
the
indians
did
viz
want
hands
move
when
was
made
into
the
water
difficulty
much
harder
for
surmount
than
all
the
consequences
want
tools
could
them
for
what
was
when
had
chosen
vast
tree
the
woods
and
with
much
trouble
cut
down
had
been
able
with
tools
hew
and
dub
the
outside
into
the
proper
shape
boat
and
burn
cut
out
the
inside
make
hollow
make
boat
after
all
this
must
leave
just
there
where
found
and
not
able
launch
into
the
water
one
would
have
thought
could
not
have
had
the
least
reflection
upon
mind
circumstances
while
was
making
this
boat
but
should
have
immediately
thought
how
should
get
into
the
sea
but
thoughts
were
intent
upon
voyage
over
the
sea
that
never
once
considered
how
should
get
off
the
land
and
was
really
its
own
nature
more
easy
for
guide
over
forty
five
miles
sea
than
about
forty
five
fathoms
land
where
lay
set
afloat
the
water
went
work
upon
this
boat
the
most
like
fool
that
ever
man
did
who
had
any
his
senses
awake
pleased
myself
with
the
design
without
determining
whether
was
ever
able
undertake
not
but
that
the
difficulty
launching
boat
came
often
into
head
but
put
stop
inquiries
into
this
foolish
answer
which
gave
myself
let
first
make
warrant
will
find
some
way
other
get
along
when
done
this
was
most
preposterous
method
but
the
eagerness
fancy
prevailed
and
work
went
felled
cedar
tree
and
question
much
whether
solomon
ever
had
such
one
for
the
building
the
temple
jerusalem
was
five
feet
ten
inches
diameter
the
lower
part
next
the
stump
and
four
feet
eleven
inches
diameter
the
end
twenty
two
feet
after
which
lessened
for
while
and
then
parted
into
branches
was
not
without
infinite
labour
that
felled
this
tree
was
twenty
days
hacking
and
hewing
the
bottom
was
fourteen
more
getting
the
branches
and
limbs
and
the
vast
spreading
head
cut
off
which
hacked
and
hewed
through
with
axe
and
hatchet
and
inexpressible
labour
after
this
cost
month
shape
and
dub
proportion
and
something
like
the
bottom
boat
that
might
swim
upright
ought
cost
near
three
months
more
clear
the
inside
and
work
out
make
exact
boat
this
did
indeed
without
fire
mere
mallet
and
chisel
and
the
dint
hard
labour
till
had
brought
very
handsome
periagua
and
big
enough
have
carried
six
and
twenty
men
and
consequently
big
enough
have
carried
and
all
cargo
when
had
gone
through
this
work
was
extremely
delighted
with
the
boat
was
really
much
bigger
than
ever
saw
canoe
periagua
that
was
made
one
tree
life
many
weary
stroke
had
cost
you
may
sure
and
had
gotten
into
the
water
make
question
but
should
have
begun
the
maddest
voyage
and
the
most
unlikely
performed
that
ever
was
undertaken
but
all
devices
get
into
the
water
failed
though
they
cost
infinite
labour
too
lay
about
one
hundred
yards
from
the
water
and
not
more
but
the
first
inconvenience
was
was
hill
towards
the
creek
well
take
away
this
discouragement
resolved
dig
into
the
surface
the
earth
and
make
declivity
this
began
and
cost
prodigious
deal
pains
but
who
grudge
pains
who
have
their
deliverance
view
but
when
this
was
worked
through
and
this
difficulty
managed
was
still
much
the
same
for
could
more
stir
the
canoe
than
could
the
other
boat
then
measured
the
distance
ground
and
resolved
cut
dock
canal
bring
the
water
the
canoe
seeing
could
not
bring
the
canoe
down
the
water
well
began
this
work
and
when
began
enter
upon
and
calculate
how
deep
was
dug
how
broad
how
the
stuff
was
thrown
out
found
that
the
number
hands
had
being
none
but
own
must
have
been
ten
twelve
years
before
could
have
gone
through
with

the

that
the
upper
end
must
have
been

twenty
feet
deep
length
though
with
great
reluctancy
gave
this
attempt
over
also
this
grieved
heartily
and
now
saw
though
too
late
the
folly
beginning
work
before
count
the
cost
and
before
judge
rightly
our
own
strength
through
with
the
middle
this
work
finished
fourth
year

kept

the

with
much
comfort

frequently

with

admired

which
had
thus
spread

the
wilderness
learned
look
more
upon
the
bright
side
condition
and
less
upon
the
dark
side
and
consider
what
enjoyed
rather
than
what
wanted
and
this
gave
sometimes
such
secret
comforts
that
cannot
express
them
and
which
take
notice
here
put
those
discontented
people
mind
who
cannot
enjoy
comfortably
what
god
has
given
them
because
they
see
and
covet
something
that
has
not
given
them
all
our
discontents
about
what
want
appeared
spring
from
the
want
thankfulness
for
what
have
another
reflection
was
great
use
and
doubtless
would
any
one
that
should
fall
into
such
distress
mine
was
and
this
was
compare
present
condition
with
what
first
expected
would
nay
with
what
would
certainly
have
been
the
good
providence
god
had
not
wonderfully
ordered
the
ship
cast
nearer
the
shore
where
not
only
could
come
her
but
could
bring
what
got
out
her
the
shore
for
relief
and
comfort
without
which
had
wanted
for
tools
work
weapons
for
defence
and
gunpowder
and
shot
for
getting
food
spent
whole
hours
may
say
whole
days
representing
myself
the
most
lively
colours
how
must
have
acted
had
got
nothing
out
the
ship
how
could
not
have
much
got
any
food
except
fish
and
turtles
and
that
was
long
before
found
any
them
must
have
perished
first
that
should
have
lived
had
not
perished
like
mere
savage
that
had
killed
goat
fowl
any
contrivance
had
way
flay
open
part
the
flesh
from
the
skin
and
the
bowels
cut
but
must
gnaw
with
teeth
and
pull
with
claws
like
beast
these
reflections
made
very
sensible
the
goodness
providence
and
very
thankful
for
present
condition
with
all
its
hardships
and
misfortunes
and
this
part
also
cannot
but
recommend
the
reflection
those
who
are
apt
their
misery
say
any
affliction
like
mine
let
them
consider
how
much
worse
the
cases
some
people
are
and
their
case
might
have
been
providence
had
thought
fit
had
another
reflection
which
assisted
also
comfort
mind
with
hopes
and
this
was
comparing
present
situation
with
what
had
deserved
and
had
therefore
reason
expect
from
the
hand
providence
had
lived
dreadful
life
perfectly
destitute
the
knowledge
and
fear
god
had
been
well
instructed
father
and
mother
neither
had
they
been
wanting
their
early
endeavours
infuse
religious
awe
god
into
mind
sense
duty
and
what
the
nature
and
end
being
required
but
alas
falling
early
into
the
seafaring
life
which
all
lives
the
most
destitute
the
fear
god
though
his
terrors
are
always
before
them
say
falling
early
into
the
seafaring
life
and
into
seafaring
company
all
that
little
sense
religion
which
had
entertained
was
laughed
out
messmates
hardened
despising
dangers
and
the
views
death
which
grew
habitual
long
absence
from
all
manner
opportunities
converse
with
anything
but
what
was
like
myself
hear
anything
that
was
good
tended
towards
void
was
everything
that
was
good
the
least
sense
what
was
was
that
the
greatest
deliverances
enjoyed
such
escape
from
sallee
being
taken
the
portuguese
master
the
ship
being
planted
well
the
brazils
receiving
the
cargo
from
england
and
the
like
never
had
once
the
words
thank

much
thought
pray
him

upon
nor

blaspheme

terrible
reflections
upon
mind
for
many
months
have
already
observed
account
wicked
and
hardened
life
past

when
looked
about

what

not

punished
less
than
iniquity
had
deserved

had
plentifully
provided
for
this

great
hopes
that
repentance
was
accepted
and
that

these
reflections
worked
mind
not
only
resignation
the

the

but
even
sincere
thankfulness
for

that

the

which

looked
upon
with

observed
that
the

afterwards
made

the

viz
the

that

had
life
miraculously
saved
twenty
six
years
after
when
was
cast
shore
this
island
that
wicked

and
solitary
life
began

the
next
thing

being
wasted
was
that

the
biscuit
which
brought
out
the
ship
this
had
husbanded
the
last
degree
allowing
myself
but
one
cake
bread
day
for
above
year
and
yet
was
quite
without
bread
for
near
year
before
got
any
corn
own
and
great
reason
had
thankful
that
had
any
all
the
getting
being
has
been
already
observed
next
miraculous
clothes
too
began
decay
linen
had
had
none
good
while
except
some
chequered
shirts
which
found
the
chests
the
other
seamen
and
which
carefully
preserved
because
many
times
could
bear
other
clothes
but
shirt
and
was
very
great
help
that
had
among
all
the
men
clothes
the
ship
almost
three
dozen
shirts
there
were
also
indeed
several
thick
watch
coats
the
seamen
which
were
left
but
they
were
too
hot
wear
and
though
true
that
the
weather
was
violently
hot
that
there
was
need
clothes
yet
could
not
quite
naked
though
had
been
inclined
which
was
not
nor
could
abide
the
thought
though
was
alone
the
reason
why
could
not
naked
was
could
not
bear
the
heat
the
sun
well
when
quite
naked
with
some
clothes
nay
the
very
heat
frequently
blistered
skin
whereas
with
shirt
the
air
itself
made
some
motion
and
whistling
under
the
shirt
was
twofold
cooler
than
without
more
could
ever
bring
myself
out
the
heat
the
sun
without
cap
hat
the
heat
the
sun
beating
with
such
violence
does
that
place
would
give
the
headache
presently
darting
directly
head
without
cap
hat
that
could
not
bear
whereas
put
hat
would
presently
away
upon
these
views
began
consider
about
putting
the
few
rags
had
which
called
clothes
into
some
order
had
worn
out
all
the
waistcoats
had
and
business
was
now
try
could
not
make
jackets
out
the
great
watch
coats
which
had
and
with
such
other
materials
had
set
work
tailoring
rather
indeed
botching
for
made
most
piteous
work
however
made
shift
make
two
three
new
waistcoats
which
hoped
would
serve
great
while
for
breeches
drawers
made
but
very
sorry
shift
indeed
till
afterwards
have
mentioned
that
saved
the
skins
all
the
creatures
that
killed
mean
four
footed
ones
and
had
them
hung
stretched
out
with
sticks
the
sun
which
means
some
them
were
dry
and
hard
that
they
were
fit
for
little
but
others
were
very
useful
the
first
thing
made
these
was
great
cap
for
head
with
the
hair
the
outside
shoot
off
the
rain
and
this
performed
well
that
after
made
suit
clothes
wholly
these
skins
that
say
waistcoat
and
breeches
open
the
knees
and
both
loose
for
they
were
rather
wanting
keep
cool
than
keep
warm
must
not
omit
acknowledge
that
they
were
wretchedly
made
for
was
bad
carpenter
was
worse
tailor
however
they
were
such
made
very
good
shift
with
and
when
was
out
happened

the
hair
waistcoat
and
cap
being
outermost
was
kept
very
dry
after
this
spent
great
deal
time
and
pains
make
umbrella
was
indeed
great
want
one
and
had
great
mind
make
one
had
seen
them
made
the
brazils
where
they
are
very
useful
the
great
heats
there
and
felt
the
heats
every
jot
great
here
and
greater
too
being
nearer
the
equinox
besides
was
obliged
much
abroad
was
most
useful
thing
well
for
the
rains
the
heats
took
world
pains
with
and
was
great
while
before
could
make
anything
likely
hold
nay
after
had
thought
had
hit
the
way
spoiled
two
three
before
made
one
mind
but
last
made
one
that
answered
indifferently
well
the
main
difficulty
found
was
make
let
down
could
make
spread
but
did
not
let
down
too
and
draw
was
not
portable
for
any
way
but
just
over
head
which
would
not
however
last
said
made
one
answer
and
covered
with
skins
the
hair
upwards
that
cast
off
the
rain
like
pent
house
and
kept
off
the
sun
effectually
that
could
walk
out
the
hottest
the
weather
with
greater
advantage
than
could
before
the
coolest
and
when
had
need
could
close
and
carry
under

thus
lived
mighty
comfortably
mind
being
entirely
composed
resigning
myself
the
will
god
and
throwing
myself
wholly
upon
the
disposal
his
providence
this
made
life
better
than
sociable
for
when
began
regret
the
want
conversation
would
ask
myself
whether
thus
conversing
mutually
with
own
thoughts
and
hope
may
say
with
even
god
himself
ejaculations
was
not
better
than
the
utmost
enjoyment
human
society
the
world
chapter
tames
goats
cannot
say
that
after
this
for
five
years
any
extraordinary
thing
happened
but
lived
the
same
course
the
same
posture
and
place
before
the
chief
things
was
employed
besides
yearly
labour
planting
barley
and
rice
and
curing
raisins
both
which
always
kept
just
enough
have
sufficient
stock
one
year
provisions
beforehand
say
besides
this
yearly
labour
and
daily
pursuit
going
out
with
gun
had
one
labour
make
canoe
which
last
finished
that
digging
canal
six
feet
wide
and
four
feet
deep
brought
into
the
creek
almost
half
mile
for
the
first
which
was
vastly
big
for
made
without
considering
beforehand
ought
have
done
how
should
able
launch
never
being
able
bring
into
the
water
bring
the
water
was
obliged
let
lie
where
was
memorandum
teach
wiser
the
next
time
indeed
the
next
time
though
could
not
get
tree
proper
for
and
was
place
where
could
not
get
the
water
any
less
distance
than
have
said
near
half
mile
yet
saw
was
practicable
last
never
gave
over
and
though
was
near
two
years
about
yet
never
grudged
labour
hopes
having
boat
off
sea
last
however
though
little
periagua
was
finished
yet
the
size
was
not
all
answerable
the
design
which
had
view
when
made
the
first
mean
venturing
over
the
terra
firma
where
was
above
forty
miles
broad
accordingly
the
smallness
boat
assisted
put
end
that
design
and
now
thought
more
had
boat
next
design
was
make
cruise
round
the
island
for
had
been
the
other
side
one
place
crossing
have
already
described
over
the
land
the
discoveries
made
that
little
journey
made
very
eager
see
other
parts
the
coast
and
now
had
boat
thought
nothing
but
sailing
round
the
island
for
this
purpose
that
might
everything
with
discretion
and
consideration
fitted
little
mast
boat
and
made
sail
too
out
some
the
pieces
the
ship
sails
which
lay
store
and
which
had
great
stock
having
fitted
mast
and
sail
and
tried
the
boat
found
she
would
sail
very
well
then
made
little
lockers
boxes
each
end
boat
put
provisions
necessaries
ammunition
into
kept
dry
either
from
rain
the
spray
the
sea
and
little
long
hollow
place
cut
the
inside
the
boat
where
could
lay
gun
making
flap
hang
down
over
keep
dry
fixed
umbrella
also
the
step
the
stern
like
mast
stand
over
head
and
keep
the
heat
the
sun
off
like
awning
and
thus
every
now
and
then
took
little
voyage
upon
the
sea
but
never
went
far
out
nor
far
from
the
little
creek
last
being
eager
view
the
circumference
little
kingdom
resolved
upon
cruise
and
accordingly
victualled
ship
for
the
voyage
putting
two
dozen
loaves
cakes
should
call
them
barley
bread
earthen
pot
full
parched
rice
food
ate
good
deal
little
bottle
rum
half
goat
and
powder
and
shot
for
killing
more
and
two
large
watch
coats
those
which
mentioned
before
had
saved
out
the
seamen
chests
these
took
one
lie
upon
and
the
other
cover
the
night
was
the
november
the
sixth
year
reign
captivity
which
you
please
that
set
out
this
voyage
and
found
much
longer
than
expected
for
though
the
island
itself
was
not
very
large
yet
when
came
the
east
side
found
great
ledge
rocks
lie
out
about
two
leagues
into
the
sea
some
above
water
some
under
and
beyond
that
shoal
sand
lying
dry
half
league
more
that
was
obliged
great
way
out
sea
double
the
point
when
first
discovered
them
was
going
give
over
enterprise
and
come
back
again
not
knowing
how
far
might
oblige
out
sea
and
above
all
doubting
how
should
get
back
again
came
anchor
for
had
made
kind
anchor
with
piece
broken
grappling
which
got
out
the
ship
having
secured
boat
took
gun
and
went
shore
climbing
hill
which
seemed
overlook
that
point
where
saw
the
full
extent
and
resolved
venture
viewing
the
sea
from
that
hill
where
stood
perceived
strong
and
indeed
most
furious
current
which
ran
the
east
and
even
came
close
the
point
and
took
the
more
notice
because
saw
there
might
some
danger
that
when
came
into
might
carried
out
sea
the
strength
and
not
able
make
the
island
again
and
indeed
had
not
got
first
upon
this
hill
believe
would
have
been
for
there
was
the
same
current
the
other
side
the
island
only
that
set
off
further
distance
and
saw
there
was
strong
eddy
under
the
shore
had
nothing
but
get
out
the
first
current
and
should
presently
eddy
lay
here
however
two
days
because
the
wind
blowing
pretty
fresh
ese
and
that
being
just
contrary
the
current
made
great
breach
the
sea
upon
the
point
that
was
not
safe
for
keep
too
close
the
shore
for
the
breach
nor
too
far
off
because
the
stream
the
third
day
the
morning
the
wind
having
abated
overnight
the
sea
was
calm
and
ventured
but
warning
all
rash
and
ignorant
pilots
for
sooner
was
come
the
point
when
was
not
even
boat
length
from
the
shore
but
found
myself
great
depth
water
and
current
like
the
sluice
mill
carried
boat
along
with
with
such
violence
that
all
could
could
not
keep
her
much
the
edge
but
found
hurried
farther
and
farther
out
from
the
eddy
which
was
left
hand
there
was
wind
stirring
help
and
all
could
with
paddles
signified
nothing
and
now
began
give
myself
over
for
lost
for
the
current
was
both
sides
the
island
knew
few
leagues
distance
they
must
join
again
and
then
was
irrecoverably
gone
nor
did
see
any
possibility
avoiding
that
had
prospect
before
but
perishing
not
the
sea
for
that
was
calm
enough
but
starving
from
hunger
had
indeed
found
tortoise
the
shore
big
almost
could
lift
and
had
tossed
into
the
boat
and
had
great
jar
fresh
water
that
say
one
earthen
pots
but
what
was
all
this
being
driven
into
the
vast
ocean
where
sure
there
was
shore
mainland
island
for
thousand
leagues
least
and
now
saw
how
easy
was
for
the
providence
god
make
even
the
most
miserable
condition
mankind
worse
now
looked
back
upon
desolate
solitary
island
the
most
pleasant
place
the
world
and
all
the
happiness
heart
could
wish
for
was
but
there
again
stretched
out
hands
with
eager
wishes
happy
desert
said
shall
never
see
thee
more
miserable
creature
whither
going
then
reproached
myself
with
unthankful
temper
and
that
had
repined
solitary
condition
and
now
what
would
give
shore
there
again
thus
never
see
the
true
state
our
condition
till
illustrated
its
contraries
nor
know
how
value
what
enjoy
but
the
want
scarcely
possible
imagine
the
consternation
was
now
being
driven
from
beloved
island
for
appeared
now
into
the
wide
ocean
almost
two
leagues
and
the
utmost
despair
ever
recovering
again
however
worked
hard
till
indeed
strength
was
almost
exhausted
and
kept
boat
much
the
northward
that
towards
the
side
the
current
which
the
eddy
lay
possibly
could
when
about
noon
the
sun
passed
the
meridian
thought
felt
little
breeze
wind
face
springing
from
sse
this
cheered
heart
little
and
especially
when
about
half
hour
more
blew
pretty
gentle
gale
this
time
had
got
frightful
distance
from
the
island
and
had
the
least
cloudy
hazy
weather
intervened
had
been
undone
another
way
too
for
had
compass
board
and
should
never
have
known
how
have
steered
towards
the
island
had
but
once
lost
sight
but
the
weather
continuing
clear
applied
myself
get
mast
again
and
spread
sail
standing
away
the
north
much
possible
get
out
the
current
just
had
set
mast
and
sail
and
the
boat
began
stretch
away
saw
even
the
clearness
the
water
some
alteration
the
current
was
near
for
where
the
current
was
strong
the
water
was
foul
but
perceiving
the
water
clear
found
the
current
abate
and
presently
found
the
east
about
half
mile
breach
the
sea
upon
some
rocks
these
rocks
found
caused
the
current
part
again
and
the
main
stress
ran
away
more
southerly
leaving
the
rocks
the
north
east
the
other
returned
the
repulse
the
rocks
and
made
strong
eddy
which
ran
back
again
the
north
west
with
very
sharp
stream
they
who
know
what
have
reprieve
brought
them
upon
the
ladder
rescued
from
thieves
just
going
murder
them
who
have
been
such
extremities
may
guess
what
present
surprise
joy
was
and
how
gladly
put
boat
into
the
stream
this
eddy
and
the
wind
also
freshening
how
gladly
spread
sail
running
cheerfully
before
the
wind
and
with
strong
tide
eddy
underfoot
this
eddy
carried
about
league
way
back
again
directly
towards
the
island
but
about
two
leagues
more
the
northward
than
the
current
which
carried
away
first
that
when
came
near
the
island
found
myself
open
the
northern
shore
that
say
the
other
end
the
island
opposite
that
which
went
out
from
when
had
made
something
more
than
league
way
the
help
this
current
eddy
found
was
spent
and
served
further
however
found
that
being
between
two
great
currents
viz
that
the
south
side
which
had
hurried
away
and
that
the
north
which
lay
about
league
the
other
side
say
between
these
two
the
wake
the
island
found
the
water
least
still
and
running
way
and
having
still
breeze
wind
fair
for
kept
steering
directly
for
the
island
though
not
making
such
fresh
way
did
before
about
four
clock
the
evening
being
then
within
league
the
island
found
the
point
the
rocks
which
occasioned
this
disaster
stretching
out
described
before
the
southward
and
casting
off
the
current
more
southerly
had
course
made
another
eddy
the
north
and
this
found
very
strong
but
not
directly
setting
the
way
course
lay
which
was
due
west
but
almost
full
north
however
having
fresh
gale
stretched
across
this
eddy
slanting
north
west
and
about
hour
came
within
about
mile
the
shore
where
being
smooth
water
soon
got
land
when
was
shore
god
fell
knees
and
gave
god
thanks
for
deliverance
resolving
lay
aside
all
thoughts
deliverance
boat
and
refreshing
myself
with
such
things
had
brought
boat
close
the
shore
little
cove
that
had
spied
under
some
trees
and
laid
down
sleep
being
quite
spent
with
the
labour
and
fatigue
the
voyage
was
now
great
loss
which
way
get
home
with
boat
had
run
much
hazard
and
knew
too
much
the
case
think
attempting
the
way
went
out
and
what
might
the
other
side
mean
the
west
side
knew
not
nor
had
any
mind
run
any
more
ventures
resolved
the
next
morning
make
way
westward
along
the
shore
and
see
there
was
creek
where
might
lay
frigate
safety
have
her
again
wanted
her
about
three
miles
thereabouts
coasting
the
shore
came
very
good
inlet
bay
about
mile
over
which
narrowed
till
came
very
little
rivulet
brook
where
found
very
convenient
harbour
for
boat
and
where
she
lay
she
had
been
little
dock
made
purpose
for
her
here
put
and
having
stowed
boat
very
safe
went
shore
look
about
and
see
where
was
soon
found
had
but
little
passed
the
place
where
had
been
before
when
travelled
foot
that
shore
taking
nothing
out
boat
but
gun
and
umbrella
for
was
exceedingly
hot
began
march
the
way
was
comfortable
enough
after
such
voyage
had
been
upon
and
reached
old
bower
the
evening
where
found
everything
standing
left
for
always
kept
good
order
being
said
before
country
house
got
over
the
fence
and
laid
down
the
shade
rest
limbs
for
was
very
weary
and
fell
asleep
but
judge
you
you
can
that
read
story
what
surprise
must
when
was
awaked
out
sleep
voice
calling
name
several
times
robin
robin
robin
crusoe
poor
robin
crusoe
where
are
you
robin
crusoe
where
are
you
where
have
you
been
was
dead
asleep
first
being
fatigued
with
rowing
part
the
day
and
with
walking
the
latter
part
that
did
not
wake
thoroughly
but
dozing
thought
dreamed
that
somebody
spoke
but
the
voice
continued
repeat
robin
crusoe
robin
crusoe
last
began
wake
more
perfectly
and
was
first
dreadfully
frightened
and
started
the
utmost
consternation
but
sooner
were
eyes
open
but
saw
poll
sitting
the
top
the
hedge
and
immediately
knew
that
was
that
spoke
for
just
such
bemoaning
language
had
used
talk
him
and
teach
him
and
had
learned
perfectly
that
would
sit
upon
finger
and
lay
his
bill
close
face
and
cry
poor
robin
crusoe
where
are
you
where
have
you
been
how
came
you
here
and
such
things
had
taught
him
however
even
though
knew
was
the
parrot
and
that
indeed
could
nobody
else
was
good
while
before
could
compose
myself
first
was
amazed
how
the
creature
got
thither
and
then
how
should
just
keep
about
the
place
and
nowhere
else
but
was
well
satisfied
could
nobody
but
honest
poll
got
over
and
holding
out
hand
and
calling
him
his
name
poll
the
sociable
creature
came
and
sat
upon
thumb
used
and
continued
talking
poor
robin
crusoe
and
how
did
come
here
and
where
had
been
just
had
been
overjoyed
see
again
and
carried
him
home
along
with
had
now
had
enough
rambling
sea
for
some
time
and
had
enough
for
many
days
sit
still
and
reflect
upon
the
danger
had
been
would
have
been
very
glad
have
had
boat
again
side
the
island
but
knew
not
how
was
practicable
get
about
the
east
side
the
island
which
had
gone
round
knew
well
enough
there
was
venturing
that
way
very
heart
would
shrink
and
very
blood
run
chill
but
think
and
the
other
side
the
island
did
not
know
how
might
there
but
supposing
the
current
ran
with
the
same
force
against
the
shore
the
east
passed
the
other
might
run
the
same
risk
being
driven
down
the
stream
and
carried
the
island
had
been
before
being
carried
away
from
with
these
thoughts
contented
myself
without
any
boat
though
had
been
the
product
many
months
labour
make
and
many
more
get
into
the
sea
this
government
temper
remained
near
year
and
lived
very
sedate
retired
life
you
may
well
suppose
and
thoughts
being
very
much
composed
condition
and
fully
comforted
resigning
myself
the
dispositions
providence
thought
lived
really
very
happily
all
things
except
that
society
improved
myself
this
time
all
the
mechanic
exercises
which
necessities
put
upon
applying
myself
and
believe
should
upon
occasion
have
made
very
good
carpenter
especially
considering
how
few
tools
had
besides
this
arrived
unexpected
perfection
earthenware
and
contrived
well
enough
make
them
with
wheel
which
found
infinitely
easier
and
better
because
made
things
round
and
shaped
which
before
were
filthy
things
indeed
look
but
think
was
never
more
vain
own
performance
more
joyful
for
anything
found
out
than
for
being
able
make
tobacco
pipe
and
though
was
very
ugly
clumsy
thing
when
was
done
and
only
burned
red
like
other
earthenware
yet
was
hard
and
firm
and
would
draw
the
smoke
was
exceedingly
comforted
with
for
had
been
always
used
smoke
and
there
were
pipes
the
ship
but
forgot
them
first
not
thinking
there
was
tobacco
the
island
and
afterwards
when
searched
the
ship
again
could
not
come
any
pipes
wicker
ware
also
improved
much
and
made
abundance
necessary
baskets
well
invention
showed
though
not
very
handsome
yet
they
were
such
were
very
handy
and
convenient
for
laying
things
fetching
things
home
for
example
killed
goat
abroad
could
hang
tree
flay
dress
and
cut
pieces
and
bring
home
basket
and
the
like
turtle
could
cut
take
out
the
eggs
and
piece
two
the
flesh
which
was
enough
for
and
bring
them
home
basket
and
leave
the
rest
behind
also
large
deep
baskets
were
the
receivers
corn
which
always
rubbed
out
soon
was
dry
and
cured
and
kept
great
baskets
began
now
perceive
powder
abated
considerably
this
was
want
which
was
impossible
for
supply
and
began
seriously
consider
what
must
when
should
have
more
powder
that
say
how
should
kill
any
goats
had
observed
the
third
year
being
here
kept
young
kid
and
bred
her
tame
and
was
hopes
getting
goat
but
could
not
any
means
bring
pass
till
kid
grew
old
goat
and
could
never
find
heart
kill
her
she
died
last
mere
age
but
being
now
the
eleventh
year
residence
and
have
said
ammunition
growing
low
set
myself
study
some
art
trap
and
snare
the
goats
see
whether
could
not
catch
some
them
alive
and
particularly
wanted
she
goat
great
with
young
for
this
purpose
made
snares
hamper
them
and
believe
they
were
more
than
once
taken
them
but
tackle
was
not
good
for
had
wire
and
always
found
them
broken
and
bait
devoured
length
resolved
try
pitfall
dug
several
large
pits
the
earth
places
where
had
observed
the
goats
used
feed
and
over
those
pits
placed
hurdles
own
making
too
with
great
weight
upon
them
and
several
times
put
ears
barley
and
dry
rice
without
setting
the
trap
and
could
easily
perceive
that
the
goats
had
gone
and
eaten
the
corn
for
could
see
the
marks
their
feet
length
set
three
traps
one
night
and
going
the
next
morning
found
them
all
standing
and
yet
the
bait
eaten
and
gone
this
was
very
discouraging
however
altered
traps
and
not
trouble
you
with
particulars
going
one
morning
see
traps
found
one
them
large
old
goat
and
one
the
others
three
kids
male
and
two
females
the
old
one
knew
not
what
with
him
was
fierce
durst
not
into
the
pit
him
that
say
bring
him
away
alive
which
was
what
wanted
could
have
killed
him
but
that
was
not
business
nor
would
answer
end
even
let
him
out
and
ran
away
had
been
frightened
out
his
wits
but
did
not
then
know
what
afterwards
learned
that
hunger
will
tame
lion
had
let
him
stay
three
four
days
without
food
and
then
have
carried
him
some
water
drink
and
then
little
corn
would
have
been
tame
one
the
kids
for
they
are
mighty
sagacious
tractable
creatures
where
they
are
well
used
however
for
the
present
let
him
knowing
better
that
time
then
went
the
three
kids
and
taking
them
one
one
tied
them
with
strings
together
and
with
some
difficulty
brought
them
all
home
was
good
while
before
they
would
feed
but
throwing
them
some
sweet
corn
tempted
them
and
they
began
tame
and
now
found
that
expected
supply
myself
with
goats
flesh
when
had
powder
shot
left
breeding
some
tame
was
only
way
when
perhaps
might
have
them
about
house
like
flock
sheep
but
then
occurred
that
must
keep
the
tame
from
the
wild
else
they
would
always
run
wild
when
they
grew
and
the
only
way
for
this
was
have
some
enclosed
piece
ground
well
fenced
either
with
hedge
pale
keep
them
effectually
that
those
within
might
not
break
out
those
without
break
this
was
great
undertaking
for
one
pair
hands
yet
saw
there
was
absolute
necessity
for
doing
first
work
was
find
out
proper
piece
ground
where
there
was
likely
herbage
for
them
eat
water
for
them
drink
and
cover
keep
them
from
the
sun
those
who
understand
such
enclosures
will
think
had
very
little
contrivance
when
pitched
upon
place
very
proper
for
all
these
being
plain
open
piece
meadow
land
savannah
our
people
call
the
western
colonies
which
had
two
three
little
drills
fresh
water
and
one
end
was
very
woody
say
they
will
smile
forecast
when
shall
tell
them
began
enclosing
this
piece
ground
such
manner
that
hedge
pale
must
have
been
least
two
miles
about
nor
was
the
madness
great
the
compass
for
was
ten
miles
about
was
like
have
time
enough
but
did
not
consider
that
goats
would
wild
much
compass
they
had
had
the
whole
island
and
should
have
much
room
chase
them
that
should
never
catch
them
hedge
was
begun
and
carried
believe
about
fifty
yards
when
this
thought
occurred
presently
stopped
short
and
for
the
beginning
resolved
enclose
piece
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
length
and
one
hundred
yards
breadth
which
would
maintain
many
should
have
any
reasonable
time
stock
increased
could
add
more
ground
enclosure
this
was
acting
with
some
prudence
and
went
work
with
courage
was
about
three
months
hedging
the
first
piece
and
till
had
done
tethered
the
three
kids
the
best
part
and
used
them
feed
near
possible
make
them
familiar
and
very
often
would
and
carry
them
some
ears
barley
handful
rice
and
feed
them
out
hand
that
after
enclosure
was
finished
and
let
them
loose
they
would
follow
and
down
bleating
after
for
handful
corn
this
answered
end
and
about
year
and
half
had
flock
about
twelve
goats
kids
and
all
and
two
years
more
had
three
and
forty
besides
several
that
took
and
killed
for
food
after
that
enclosed
five
several
pieces
ground
feed
them
with
little
pens
drive
them
take
them
wanted
and
gates
out
one
piece
ground
into
another
but
this
was
not
all
for
now
not
only
had
goat
flesh
feed
when
pleased
but
milk
too
thing
which
indeed
the
beginning
did
not
much
think
and
which
when
came
into
thoughts
was
really
agreeable
surprise
for
now
set
dairy
and
had
sometimes
gallon
two
milk
day
and
nature

gives

every

even
naturally
how
make

had
never
milked

much
less

when
was

after
great
many

though
found
partly
made
hand
the
heat
the

and
never
wanted
afterwards
how
mercifully
can
our
creator
treat
his
creatures
even
those
conditions
which
they
seemed
overwhelmed
destruction
how
can
sweeten
the
bitterest
providences
and
give

therefore
sometimes
sat
contriving

sat
myself
down
contented
enough
without
her

had
strange
uneasiness
mind
down
the

have

how

upon
them
but
they
were
length
and
shape
monstrous
enough
and
such
england
would
have
passed
for
frightful
but
all
this
the
bye
for
figure
had
few
observe
that
was
manner
consequence
say
more
that
this
kind
dress
went
new
journey
and
was
out
five
six
days
travelled
first
along
the
sea
shore
directly
the
place
where
first
brought
boat
anchor
get
upon
the
rocks
and
having
boat
now
take
care
went
over
the
land
nearer
way
the
same
height
that
was
upon
before
when
looking
forward
the
points
the
rocks
which
lay
out
and
which
was
obliged
double
with
boat
said
above
was
surprised
see
the
sea
all
smooth
and
quiet
rippling
motion
current
any
more
there
than
other
places
was
strange
loss
understand
this
and
resolved
spend
some
time
the
observing
see
nothing
from
the
sets
the
tide
had
occasioned
but
was
presently
convinced
how
was
viz
that
the
tide
ebb
setting
from
the
west
and
joining
with
the
current
waters
from
some
great
river
the
shore
must
the
occasion
this
current
and
that
according
the
wind
blew
more
forcibly
from
the
west
from
the
north
this
current
came
nearer
went
farther
from
the
shore
for
waiting
thereabouts
till
evening
went
the
rock
again
and
then
the
tide
ebb
being
made
plainly
saw
the
current
again
before
only
that
ran
farther
off
being
near
half
league
from
the
shore
whereas
case
set
close
upon
the
shore
and
hurried
and
canoe
along
with
which
another
time
would
not
have
done
this
observation
convinced
that
had
nothing
but
observe
the
ebbing
and
the
flowing
the
tide
and
might
very
easily
bring
boat
about
the
island
again
but
when
began
think
putting
practice
had
such
terror
upon
spirits
the
remembrance
the
danger
had
been
that
could
not
think
again
with
any
patience
but
the
contrary
took
another
resolution
which
was
more
safe
though
more
laborious
and
this
was
that
would
build
rather
make
another
periagua
canoe
and
have
one
for
one
side
the
island
and
one
for
the
other
you
are
understand
that
now
had
may
call
two
plantations
the
island
one
little
fortification
tent
with
the
wall
about
under
the
rock
with
the
cave
behind
which
this
time
had
enlarged
into
several
apartments
caves
one
within
another
one
these
which
was
the
driest
and
largest
and
had
door
out
beyond
wall
fortification
that
say
beyond
where
wall
joined
the
rock
was
all
filled
with
the
large
earthen
pots
which
have
given
account
and
with
fourteen
fifteen
great
baskets
which
would
hold
five
six
bushels
each
where
laid
stores
provisions
especially
corn
some
the
ear
cut
off
short
from
the
straw
and
the
other
rubbed
out
with
hand
for
wall
made
before
with
long
stakes
piles
those
piles
grew
all
like
trees
and
were
this
time
grown
big
and
spread
very
much
that
there
was
not
the
least
appearance
any
one
view
any
habitation
behind
them
near
this
dwelling
mine
but
little
farther
within
the
land
and
upon
lower
ground
lay
two
pieces
corn
land
which
kept
duly
cultivated
and
sowed
and
which
duly
yielded
their
harvest
its
season
and
whenever
had
occasion
for
more
corn
had
more
land
adjoining
fit
that
besides
this
had
country
seat
and
had
now
tolerable
plantation
there
also
for
first
had
little
bower
called
which
kept
repair
that
say
kept
the
hedge
which
encircled
constantly
fitted
its
usual
height
the
ladder
standing
always
the
inside
kept
the
trees
which
first
were
more
than
stakes
but
were
now
grown
very
firm
and
tall
always
cut
that
they
might
spread
and
grow
thick
and
wild
and
make
the
more
agreeable
shade
which
they
did
effectually
mind
the
middle
this
had
tent
always
standing
being
piece
sail
spread
over
poles
set
for
that
purpose
and
which
never
wanted
any
repair
renewing
and
under
this
had
made
squab
couch
with
the
skins
the
creatures
had
killed
and
with
other
soft
things
and
blanket
laid
them
such
belonged
our
sea
bedding
which
had
saved
and
great
watch
coat
cover
and
here
whenever
had
occasion
absent
from
chief
seat
took
country
habitation
adjoining
this
had
enclosures
for
cattle
that
say
goats
and
had
taken
inconceivable
deal
pains
fence
and
enclose
this
ground
was
anxious
see
kept
entire
lest
the
goats
should
break
through
that
never
left
off
till
with
infinite
labour
had
stuck
the
outside
the
hedge
full
small
stakes
and
near
one
another
that
was
rather
pale
than
hedge
and
there
was
scarce
room
put
hand
through
between
them
which
afterwards
when
those
stakes
grew
they
all
did
the
next
rainy
season
made
the
enclosure
strong
like
wall
indeed
stronger
than
any
wall
this
will
testify
for
that
was
not
idle
and
that
spared
pains
bring
pass
whatever
appeared
necessary
for
comfortable
support
for

thus

and
cheese
for
long
lived
the
place
were
forty
years
and
that
keeping
them
reach
depended
entirely
upon
perfecting
enclosures
such
degree
that
might
sure
keeping
them
together
which
this
method
indeed
effectually
secured
that
when
these
little
stakes
began
grow
had
planted
them
very
thick
that
was
forced
pull
some
them
again
this
place
also
had
grapes
growing
which
principally
depended
for
winter
store
raisins
and
which
never
failed
preserve
very
carefully

and
most
agreeable

and
indeed
they
were
not

agreeable
but
medicinal
wholesome
nourishing
and
refreshing
the
last
degree
this
was
also
about
half
way
between
other
habitation
and
the
place
where
had
laid
boat
generally
stayed
and
lay
here
way
thither
for
used
frequently
visit
boat
and
kept
all
things
about
belonging
her
very
good
order
sometimes
went
out
her
divert
myself
but
more
hazardous
voyages
would
scarcely
ever
above
stone
cast
two
from
the
shore
was
apprehensive
being
hurried
out
knowledge
again
the
currents
winds
any
other
accident
but
now
come
new
scene
life
happened
one
day
about
noon
going
towards
boat
was
exceedingly
surprised
with
the
print
man
naked
foot
the
shore
which
was
very
plain
seen
the
sand
stood
like
one
thunderstruck
had
seen
apparition
listened
looked
round
but
could
hear
nothing
nor
see
anything
went
rising
ground
look
farther
went
the
shore
and
down
the
shore
but
was
all
one
could
see
other
impression
but
that
one
went
again
see
there
were
any
more
and
observe
might
not
fancy
but
there
was
room
for
that
for
there
was
exactly
the
print
foot
toes
heel
and
every
part
foot
how
came
thither
knew
not
nor
could
the
least
imagine
but
after
innumerable
fluttering
thoughts
like
man
perfectly
confused
and
out
myself
came
home
fortification
not
feeling
say
the
ground
went
but
terrified
the
last
degree
looking
behind
every
two
three
steps
mistaking
every
bush
and
tree
and
fancying
every
stump
distance
man
nor
possible
describe
how
many
various
shapes
affrighted
imagination
represented
things
how
many
wild
ideas
were
found
every
moment
fancy
and
what
strange
unaccountable
whimsies
came
into
thoughts
the
way
when
came
castle
for
think
called
ever
after
this
fled
into
like
one
pursued
whether
went
over
the
ladder
first
contrived
went
the
hole
the
rock
which
had
called
door
cannot
remember
nor
could
remember
the
next
morning
for
never
frightened
hare
fled
cover
fox
earth
with
more
terror
mind
than
this
retreat
slept
none
that
night
the
farther
was
from
the
occasion
fright
the
greater
apprehensions
were
which
something
contrary
the
nature
such
things
and
especially
the
usual
practice
all
creatures
fear
but
was
embarrassed
with
own
frightful
ideas
the
thing
that
formed
nothing
but
dismal
imaginations
myself
even
though
was
now
great
way
off
sometimes
fancied
must
the
devil
and
reason
joined
with
this
supposition
for
how
should
any
other
thing
human
shape
come
into
the
place
where
was
the
vessel
that
brought
them
what
marks
were
there
any
other
footstep
and
how
was
possible
man
should
come
there
but
then
think
that
satan
should
take
human
shape
upon
him
such
place
where
there
could
manner
occasion
for
but
leave
the
print
his
foot
behind
him
and
that
even
for
purpose
too
for
could
not
sure
should
see
this
was
amusement
the
other
way
considered
that
the
devil
might
have
found
out
abundance
other
ways
have
terrified
than
this
the
single
print
foot
that
lived
quite
the
other
side
the
island
would
never
have
been
simple
leave
mark
place
where
was
ten
thousand
one
whether
should
ever
see
not
and
the
sand
too
which
the
first
surge
the
sea
upon
high
wind
would
have
defaced
entirely
all
this
seemed
inconsistent
with
the
thing
itself
and
with
all
the
notions
usually
entertain
the
subtlety
the
devil
abundance
such
things
these
assisted
argue
out
all
apprehensions
its
being
the
devil
and
presently
concluded
then
that
must
some
more
dangerous
creature
viz
that
must
some
the
savages
the
mainland
opposite
who
had
wandered
out
sea
their
canoes
and
either
driven
the
currents
contrary
winds
had
made
the
island
and
had
been
shore
but
were
gone
away
again
sea
being
loath
perhaps
have
stayed
this
desolate
island
would
have
been
have
had
them
while
these
reflections
were
rolling
mind
was
very
thankful
thoughts
that
was
happy
not
thereabouts
that
time
that
they
did
not
see
boat
which
they
would
have
concluded
that
some
inhabitants
had
been
the
place
and
perhaps
have
searched
farther
for
then
terrible
thoughts
racked
imagination
about
their
having
found
out
boat
and
that
there
were
people
here
and
that
should
certainly
have
them
come
again
greater
numbers
and
devour
that
should
happen
that
they
should
not
find
yet
they
would
find
enclosure
destroy
all
corn
and
carry
away
all
flock
tame
goats
and
should
perish
last
for
mere
want
thus
fear
banished
all
religious
hope
all
that
former
confidence
god
which
was
founded
upon
such
wonderful
experience
had
had
his
goodness
that
had
fed
miracle
hitherto
could
not
preserve
his
power
the
provision
which
had
made
for
his
goodness
reproached
myself
with
laziness
that
would
not
sow
any
more
corn
one
year
than
would
just
serve
till
the
next
season
accident
could
intervene
prevent
enjoying
the
crop
that
was
upon
the
ground
and
this
thought
just
reproof
that
resolved
for
the
future
have
two
three
years
corn
beforehand
that
whatever
might
come
might
not
perish
for
want
bread
how
strange
chequer
work
providence
the
life
man
and
what
secret
different
springs
are
the
affections
hurried
about
different
circumstances
present
day
love
what
morrow
hate
day
seek
what
morrow
shun
day
desire
what
morrow
fear
nay
even
tremble
the
apprehensions
this
was
exemplified
this
time
the
most
lively
manner
imaginable
for
whose
only
affliction
was
that
seemed
banished
from
human
society
that
was
alone
circumscribed
the
boundless
ocean
cut
off
from
mankind
and
condemned
what
call
silent
life
that
was
one
whom
heaven
thought
not
worthy
numbered
among
the
living
appear
among
the
rest
his
creatures
that
have
seen
one
own
species
would
have
seemed
raising
from
death
life
and
the
greatest
blessing
that
heaven
itself
next
the
supreme
blessing
salvation
could
bestow
say
that
should
now
tremble
the
very
apprehensions
seeing
man
and
was
ready
sink
into
the
ground
but
the
shadow
silent
appearance
man
having
set
his
foot
the
island
such
the
uneven
state
human
life
and
afforded
great
many
curious
speculations
afterwards
when
had
little
recovered
first
surprise
considered
that
this
was
the
station
life
the
infinitely
wise
and
good
providence
god
had
determined
for
that
could
not
foresee
what
the
ends
divine
wisdom
might
all
this
was
not
dispute
his
sovereignty
who
was
his
creature
had
undoubted
right
creation
govern
and
dispose
absolutely
thought
fit
and
who
was
creature
that
had
offended
him
had
likewise
judicial
right
condemn
what
punishment
thought
fit
and
that
was
part
submit
bear
his
indignation
because
had
sinned
against
him
then
reflected
that
god
who
was
not
only
righteous
but
omnipotent
had
thought
fit
thus
punish
and
afflict
was
able
deliver
that
did
not
think
fit
was
unquestioned
duty
resign
myself
absolutely
and
entirely
his
will
and
the
other
hand
was
duty
also
hope
him
pray
him
and
quietly
attend
the
dictates
and
directions
his
daily
providence
these
thoughts
took
many
hours
days
nay
may
say
weeks
and
months
and
one
particular
effect
cogitations
this
occasion
cannot
omit
one
morning
early
lying
bed
and
filled
with
thoughts
about
danger
from
the
appearances
savages
found
discomposed
very
much
upon
which
these
words
the
scripture
came
into
thoughts
call
upon
the
day
trouble
and
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
glorify
upon
this
rising
cheerfully
out
bed
heart
was
not
only
comforted
but
was
guided
and
encouraged
pray
earnestly
god
for
deliverance
when
had
done
praying
took
bible
and
opening
read
the
first
words
that
presented
were
wait
the
lord
and
good
cheer
and
shall
strengthen
thy
heart
wait
say
the
lord
impossible
express
the
comfort
this
gave
answer
thankfully
laid
down
the
book
and
was
more
sad
least
that
occasion
the
middle
these
cogitations
apprehensions
and
reflections
came
into
thoughts
one
day
that
all
this
might
mere
chimera
own
and
that
this
foot
might
the
print
own
foot
when
came
shore
from
boat
this
cheered
little
too
and
began
persuade
myself
was
all
delusion
that
was
nothing
else
but
own
foot
and
why
might
not
come
that
way
from
the
boat
well
was
going
that
way
the
boat
again
considered
also
that
could
means
tell
for
certain
where
had
trod
and
where
had
not
and
that
last
this
was
only
the
print
own
foot
had
played
the
part
those
fools
who
try
make
stories
spectres
and
apparitions
and
then
are
frightened
them
more
than
anybody
now
began
take
courage
and
peep
abroad
again
for
had
not
stirred
out
castle
for
three
days
and
nights
that
began
starve
for
provisions
for
had
little
nothing
within
doors
but
some
barley
cakes
and
water
then
knew
that
goats
wanted
milked
too
which
usually
was
evening
diversion
and
the
poor
creatures
were
great
pain
and
inconvenience
for
want
and
indeed
almost
spoiled
some
them
and
almost
dried
their
milk
encouraging
myself
therefore
with
the
belief
that
this
was
nothing
but
the
print
one
own
feet
and
that
might
truly
said
start
own
shadow
began
abroad
again
and
went
country
house
milk
flock
but
see
with
what
fear
went
forward
how
often
looked
behind
how
was
ready
every
now
and
then
lay
down
basket
and
run
for
life
would
have
made
any
one
have
thought
was
haunted
with
evil
conscience
that
had
been
lately
most
terribly
frightened
and
indeed
had
however
went
down
thus
two
three
days
and
having
seen
nothing
began
little
bolder
and
think
there
was
really
nothing
but
own
imagination
but
could
not
persuade
myself
fully
this
till
should
down
the
shore
again
and
see
this
print
foot
and
measure
own
and
see
there
was
any
similitude
fitness
that
might
assured
was
own
foot
but
when
came
the
place
first
appeared
evidently
that
when
laid
boat
could
not
possibly
shore
anywhere
thereabouts
secondly
when
came
measure
the
mark
with
own
foot
found
foot
not
large
great
deal
both
these
things
filled
head
with
new
imaginations
and
gave
the
vapours
again
the
highest
degree
that
shook
with
cold
like
one
ague
and
went
home
again
filled
with
the
belief
that
some
man
men
had
been
shore
there
short
that
the
island
was
inhabited
and
might
surprised
before
was
aware
and
what
course
take
for
security
knew
not
what
ridiculous
resolutions
men
take
when
possessed
with
fear
deprives
them
the
use
those
means
which
reason
offers
for
their
relief
the
first
thing
proposed
myself
was
throw
down
enclosures
and
turn
all
tame
cattle
wild
into
the
woods
lest
the
enemy
should
find
them
and
then
frequent
the
island
prospect
the
same
the
like
booty
then
the
simple
thing
digging
two
corn
fields
lest
they
should
find
such
grain
there
and
still
prompted
frequent
the
island
then
demolish
bower
and
tent
that
they
might
not
see
any
vestiges
habitation
and
prompted
look
farther
order
find
out
the
persons
inhabiting
these
were
the
subject
the
first
night
cogitations
after
was
come
home
again
while
the
apprehensions
which
had
overrun
mind
were
fresh
upon
and
head
was
full
vapours
thus
fear
danger
ten
thousand
times
more
terrifying
than
danger
itself
when
apparent
the
eyes
and
find
the
burden
anxiety
greater
much
than
the
evil
which
are
anxious
about
and
what
was
worse
than
all
this
had
not
that
relief
this
trouble
that
from
the
resignation
used
practise
hoped
have
looked
thought
like
saul
who
complained
not
only
that
the
philistines
were
upon
him
but
that
god
had
forsaken
him
for
did
not
now
take
due
ways
compose
mind
crying
god
distress
and
resting
upon
his
providence
had
done
before
for
defence
and
deliverance
which
had
done
had
least
been
more
cheerfully
supported
under
this
new
surprise
and
perhaps
carried
through
with
more
resolution
this
confusion
thoughts
kept
awake
all
night
but
the
morning
fell
asleep
and
having
the
amusement
mind
been
were
tired
and
spirits
exhausted
slept
very
soundly
and
waked
much
better
composed
than
had
ever
been
before
and
now
began
think
sedately
and
upon
debate
with
myself
concluded
that
this
island
which
was
exceedingly
pleasant
fruitful
and
farther
from
the
mainland
than
had
seen
was
not
entirely
abandoned
might
imagine
that
although
there
were
stated
inhabitants
who
lived
the
spot
yet
that
there
might
sometimes
come
boats
off
from
the
shore
who
either
with
design
perhaps
never
but
when
they
were
driven
cross
winds
might
come
this
place
that
had
lived
there
fifteen
years
now
and
had
not
met
with
the
least
shadow
figure
any
people
yet
and
that
any
time
they
should
driven
here
was
probable
they
went
away
again
soon
ever
they
could
seeing
they
had
never
thought
fit
fix
here
upon
any
occasion
that
the
most
could
suggest
any
danger
from
was
from
any
casual
accidental
landing
straggling
people
from
the
main
who
was
likely
they
were
driven
hither
were
here
against
their
wills
they
made
stay
here
but
went
off
again
with
all
possible
speed
seldom
staying
one
night
shore
lest
they
should
not
have
the
help
the
tides
and
daylight
back
again
and
that
therefore
had
nothing
but
consider
some
safe
retreat
case
should
see
any
savages
land
upon
the
spot
now
began
sorely
repent
that
had
dug
cave
large
bring
door
through
again
which
door
said
came
out
beyond
where
fortification
joined
the
rock
upon
maturely
considering
this
therefore
resolved
draw
second
fortification
the
manner
semicircle
distance
from
wall
just
where
had
planted
double
row
trees
about
twelve
years
before
which
made
mention
these
trees
having
been
planted
thick
before
they
wanted
but
few
piles
driven
between
them
that
they
might
thicker
and
stronger
and
wall
would
soon
finished
that
had
now
double
wall
and
outer
wall
was
thickened
with
pieces
timber
old
cables
and
everything
could
think
make
strong
having
seven
little
holes
about
big
might
put
arm
out
the
inside
this
thickened
wall
about
ten
feet
thick
with
continually
bringing
earth
out
cave
and
laying
the
foot
the
wall
and
walking
upon
and
through
the
seven
holes
contrived
plant
the
muskets
which
took
notice
that
had
got
seven
shore
out
the
ship
these
planted
like
cannon
and
fitted
them
into
frames
that
held
them
like
carriage
that
could
fire
all
the
seven
guns
two
minutes
time
this
wall
was
many
weary
month
finishing
and
yet
never
thought
myself
safe
till
was
done
when
this
was
done
stuck
all
the
ground
without
wall
for
great
length
every
way
full
with
stakes
sticks
the
osier
like
wood
which
found
apt
grow
they
could
well
stand
insomuch
that
believe
might
set
near
twenty
thousand
them
leaving
pretty
large
space
between
them
and
wall
that
might
have
room
see
enemy
and
they
might
have
shelter
from
the
young
trees
they
attempted
approach
outer
wall
thus
two
years
time
had
thick
grove
and
five
six
years
time
had
wood
before
dwelling
growing
monstrously
thick
and
strong
that
was
indeed
perfectly
impassable
and
men
what
kind
soever
could
ever
imagine
that
there
was
anything
beyond
much
less
habitation
for
the
way
which
proposed
myself
and
out
for
left
avenue
was
setting
two
ladders
one
part
the
rock
which
was
low
and
then
broke
and
left
room
place
another
ladder
upon
that
when
the
two
ladders
were
taken
down
man
living
could
come
down
without
doing
himself
mischief
and
they
had
come
down
they
were
still
the
outside
outer
wall
thus
took
all
the
measures
human
prudence
could
suggest
for
own
preservation
and
will
seen
length
that
they
were
not
altogether
without
just
reason
though
foresaw
nothing
that
time
more
than
mere
fear
suggested
chapter

cave
retreat
while
this
was
doing
was
not
altogether
careless
other
affairs
for
had
great
concern
upon
for
little
herd
goats
they
were
not
only
ready
supply
every
occasion
and
began
sufficient
for
without
the
expense
powder
and
shot
but
also
without
the
fatigue
hunting
after
the
wild
ones
and
was
loath
lose
the
advantage
them
and
have
them
all
nurse
over
again
for
this
purpose
after
long
consideration
could
think
but
two
ways
preserve
them
one
was
find
another
convenient
place
dig
cave
underground
and
drive
them
into
every
night
and
the
other
was
enclose
two
three
little
bits
land
remote
from
one
another
and
much
concealed
could
where
might
keep
about
half
dozen
young
goats
each
place
that
any
disaster
happened
the
flock
general
might
able
raise
them
again
with
little
trouble
and
time
and
this
though
would
require
good
deal
time
and
labour
thought
was
the
most
rational
design
accordingly
spent
some
time
find
out
the
most
retired
parts
the
island
and
pitched
upon
one
which
was
private
indeed
heart
could
wish
was
little
damp
piece
ground
the
middle
the
hollow
and
thick
woods
where
observed
almost
lost
myself
once
before
endeavouring
come
back
that
way
from
the
eastern
part
the
island
here
found
clear
piece
land
near
three
acres
surrounded
with
woods
that
was
almost
enclosure
nature
least
did
not
want
near
much
labour
make
the
other
piece
ground
had
worked
hard
immediately
went
work
with
this
piece
ground
and
less
than
month
time
had
fenced
round
that
flock
herd
call
which
you
please
which
were
not
wild
now
first
they
might
supposed
were
well
enough
secured
without
any
further
delay
removed
ten
young
she
goats
and
two
goats
this
piece
and
when
they
were
there
continued
perfect
the
fence
till
had
made
secure
the
other
which
however
did
more
leisure
and
took
more
time
great
deal
all
this
labour
was
the
expense
purely
from
apprehensions
account
the
print
man
foot
for
yet
had
never
seen
any
human
creature
come
near
the
island
and
had
now
lived
two
years
under
this
uneasiness
which
indeed
made
life
much
less
comfortable
than
was
before
may
well
imagined
any
who
know
what
live
the
constant
snare
the
fear
man
and
this
must
observe
with
grief
too
that
the
discomposure
mind
had
great
impression
also
upon
the
religious
part
thoughts
for
the
dread
and
terror
falling
into
the
hands
savages
and
cannibals
lay
upon
spirits
that
seldom
found
myself
due
temper
for
application
maker
least
not
with
the
sedate
calmness
and
resignation
soul
which
was
wont
rather
prayed
god
under
great
affliction
and
pressure
mind
surrounded
with
danger
and
expectation
every
night
being
murdered
and
devoured
before
morning
and
must
testify
from
experience
that
temper
peace
thankfulness
love
and
affection
much
the
more
proper
frame
for
prayer
than
that
terror
and
discomposure
and
that
under
the
dread
mischief
impending
man
more
fit
for
comforting
performance
the
duty
praying
god
than
for
repentance
sick
bed
for
these
discomposures
affect
the
mind
the
others
the
body
and
the
discomposure
the
mind
must
necessarily
great
disability
that
the
body
and
much
greater
praying
god
being
properly
act
the
mind
not
the
body
but
after
had
thus
secured
one
part
little
living
stock
went
about
the
whole
island
searching
for
another
private
place
make
such
another
deposit
when
wandering
more
the
west
point
the
island
than
had
ever
done
yet
and
looking
out
sea
thought
saw
boat
upon
the
sea
great
distance
had
found
perspective
glass
two
one
the
seamen
chests
which
saved
out
our
ship
but
had
not
about
and
this
was
remote
that
could
not
tell
what
make
though
looked
till
eyes
were
not
able
hold
look
any
longer
whether
was
boat
not
not
know
but
descended
from
the
hill
could
see
more
gave
over
only
resolved
more
out
without
perspective
glass
pocket
when
was
come
down
the
hill
the
end
the
island
where
indeed
had
never
been
before
was
presently
convinced
that
the
seeing
the
print
man
foot
was
not
such
strange
thing
the
island
imagined
and
but
that
was
special
providence
that
was
cast
upon
the
side
the
island
where
the
savages
never
came
should
easily
have
known
that
nothing
was
more
frequent
than
for
the
canoes
from
the
main
when
they
happened
little
too
far
out
sea
shoot
over
that
side
the
island
for
harbour
likewise
they
often
met
and
fought
their
canoes
the
victors
having
taken
any
prisoners
would
bring
them
over
this
shore
where
according
their
dreadful
customs
being
all
cannibals
they
would
kill
and
eat
them
which
hereafter
when
was
come
down
the
hill
the
shore
said
above
being
the
point
the
island
was
perfectly
confounded
and
amazed
nor
possible
for
express
the
horror
mind
seeing
the
shore
spread
with
skulls
hands
feet
and
other
bones
human
bodies
and
particularly
observed
place
where
there
had
been
fire
made
and
circle
dug
the
earth
like
cockpit
where
supposed
the
savage
wretches
had
sat
down
their
human
feastings
upon
the
bodies
their
fellow
creatures
was
astonished
with
the
sight
these
things
that
entertained
notions
any
danger
myself
from
for
long
while
all
apprehensions
were
buried
the
thoughts
such
pitch
inhuman
hellish
brutality
and
the
horror
the
degeneracy
human
nature
which
though
had
heard
often
yet
never
had
near
view
before
short
turned
away
face
from
the
horrid
spectacle
stomach
grew
sick
and
was
just
the
point
fainting
when
nature
discharged
the
disorder
from
stomach
and
having
vomited
with
uncommon
violence
was
little
relieved
but
could
not
bear
stay
the
place
moment
got
the
hill
again
with
all
the
speed
could
and
walked
towards
own
habitation
when
came
little
out
that
part
the
island
stood
still
awhile
amazed
and
then
recovering
myself
looked
with
the
utmost
affection
soul
and
with
flood
tears
eyes
gave
god
thanks
that
had
cast
first
lot
part
the
world
where
was
distinguished
from
such
dreadful
creatures
these
and
that
though
had
esteemed
present
condition
very
miserable
had
yet
given
many
comforts
that
had
still
more
give
thanks
for
than
complain
and
this
above
all
that
had
even
this
miserable
condition
been
comforted
with
the
knowledge
himself
and
the
hope
his
blessing
which
was
felicity
more
than
sufficiently
equivalent
all
the
misery
which
had
suffered
could
suffer
this
frame
thankfulness
went
home
castle
and
began
much
easier
now
the
safety
circumstances
than
ever
was
before
for
observed
that
these
wretches
never
came
this
island
search
what
they
could
get
perhaps
not
seeking
not
wanting
not
expecting
anything
here
and
having
often
doubt
been
the
covered
woody
part
without
finding
anything
their
purpose
knew
had
been
here
now
almost
eighteen
years
and
never
saw
the
least
footsteps
human
creature
there
before
and
might
eighteen
years
more
entirely
concealed
was
now
did
not
discover
myself
them
which
had
manner
occasion
being
only
business
keep
myself
entirely
concealed
where
was
unless
found
better
sort
creatures
than
cannibals
make
myself
known
yet
entertained
such
abhorrence
the
savage
wretches
that
have
been
speaking
and
the
wretched
inhuman
custom
their
devouring
and
eating
one
another
that
continued
pensive
and
sad
and
kept
close
within
own
circle
for
almost
two
years
after
this
when
say
own
circle
mean
three
plantations
viz
castle
country
seat
which
called
bower
and
enclosure
the
woods
nor
did
look
after
this
for
any
other
use
than
enclosure
for
goats
for
the
aversion
which
nature
gave
these
hellish
wretches
was
such
that
was
fearful
seeing
them
seeing
the
devil
himself
did
not
much
look
after
boat
all
this
time
but
began
rather
think
making
another
for
could
not
think
ever
making
any
more
attempts
bring
the
other
boat
round
the
island
lest
should
meet
with
some
these
creatures
sea
which
case
had
happened
have
fallen
into
their
hands
knew
what
would
have
been
lot
time
however
and
the
satisfaction
had
that
was
danger
being
discovered
these
people
began
wear
off
uneasiness
about
them
and
began
live
just
the
same
composed
manner
before
only
with
this
difference
that
used
more
caution
and
kept
eyes
more
about
than
did
before
lest
should
happen
seen
any
them
and
particularly
was
more
cautious
firing
gun
lest
any
them
being
the
island
should
happen
hear
was
therefore
very
good
providence
that
had
furnished
myself
with
tame
breed
goats
and
that
had
need
hunt
any
more
about
the
woods
shoot
them
and
did
catch
any
them
after
this
was
traps
and
snares
had
done
before
that
for
two
years
after
this
believe
never
fired
gun
once
off
though
never
went
out
without
and
what
was
more
had
saved
three
pistols
out
the
ship
always
carried
them
out
with
least
two
them
sticking
them
goat
skin
belt
also
furbished
one
the
great
cutlasses
that
had
out
the
ship
and
made
belt
hang
also
that
was
now
most
formidable
fellow
look
when
went
abroad
you
add
the
former
description
myself
the
particular
two
pistols
and
broadsword
hanging
side
belt
but
without
scabbard
things
going
thus
have
said
for
some
time
seemed
excepting
these
cautions
reduced
former
calm
sedate
way
living
all
these
things
tended
show
more
and
more
how
far
condition
was
from
being
miserable
compared
some
others
nay
many
other
particulars
life
which
might
have
pleased
god
have
made

put
upon
reflecting
how
little

there
would
among
mankind

would
rather
compare
their
condition
with

that
were
worse
order
thankful
than
always
comparing
them
with
those
which
are
better
assist
their
murmurings
and
complainings
present
condition
there
were
not
really
many
things
which
wanted
indeed
thought
that
the
frights
had
been
about
these
savage
wretches
and
the
concern
had
been
for
own
preservation
had
taken
off
the
edge
invention
for
own
conveniences
and
had
dropped
good
design
which
had
once
bent
thoughts
upon
and
that
was
try
could
not
make
some
barley
into
malt
and
then
try
brew
myself
some
beer
this
was
really
whimsical
thought
and
reproved
myself
often
for
the
simplicity
for
presently
saw
there
would
the
want
several
things
necessary
the
making
beer
that
would
impossible
for
supply
first
casks
preserve
which
was
thing
that
have
observed
already
could
never
compass
though
spent
not
only
many
days
but
weeks
nay
months
attempting
but
purpose
the
next
place
had
hops
make
keep
yeast
make
work
copper
kettle
make
boil

yet
with
all
these
things

verily
believe
had
not
the
frights
and
terrors

about
the
savages
intervened
had
undertaken
and
perhaps
brought
pass
too
for
seldom
gave
anything
over
without
accomplishing
when
once
had
head
began
but
invention
now
ran
quite
another
way
for
night
and
day
could
think
nothing
but
how
might
destroy
some
the
monsters
their
cruel
bloody
entertainment
and
possible
save
the
victim
they
should
bring
hither
destroy
would
take
larger
volume
than
this
whole
work
intended
set
down
all
the
contrivances
hatched
rather
brooded
upon
thoughts
for
the
destroying
these
creatures
least
frightening
them
prevent
their
coming
hither
any
more
but
all
this
was
abortive
nothing
could
possible
take
effect
unless
was
there
myself
and
what
could
one
man
among
them
when
perhaps
there
might
twenty
thirty
them
together
with
their
darts
their
bows
and
arrows
with
which
they
could
shoot
true
mark
could
with
gun
sometimes
thought
digging
hole
under
the
place
where
they
made
their
fire
and
putting
five
six
pounds
gunpowder
which
when
they
kindled
their
fire
would
consequently
take
fire
and
blow
all
that
was
near
but
the
first
place
should
unwilling
waste
much
powder
upon
them
store
being
now
within
the
quantity
one
barrel
neither
could
sure
its
going
off
any
certain
time
when
might
surprise
them
and
best
that
would
little
more
than
just
blow
the
fire
about
their
ears
and
fright
them
but
not
sufficient
make
them
forsake
the
place
laid
aside
and
then
proposed
that
would
place
myself
ambush
some
convenient
place
with
three
guns
all
double
loaded
and
the
middle
their
bloody
ceremony
let
fly
them
when
should
sure
kill
wound
perhaps
two
three
every
shot
and
then
falling
upon
them
with
three
pistols
and
sword
made
doubt
but
that
there
were
twenty
should
kill
them
all
this
fancy
pleased
thoughts
for
some
weeks
and
was
full
that
often
dreamed
and
sometimes
that
was
just
going
let
fly
them
sleep
went
far
with
imagination
that
employed
myself
several
days
find
out
proper
places
put
myself
ambuscade
said
watch
for
them
and
went
frequently
the
place
itself
which
was
now
grown
more
familiar
but
while
mind
was
thus
filled
with
thoughts
revenge
and
bloody
putting
twenty
thirty
them
the
sword
may
call
the
horror
had
the
place
and
the
signals
the
barbarous
wretches
devouring
one
another
abetted
malice
well
length
found
place
the
side
the
hill
where
was
satisfied
might
securely
wait
till
saw
any
their
boats
coming
and
might
then
even
before
they
would
ready
come
shore
convey
myself
unseen
into
some
thickets
trees
one
which
there
was
hollow
large
enough
conceal
entirely
and
there
might
sit
and
observe
all
their
bloody
doings
and
take
full
aim
their
heads
when
they
were
close
together
that
would
next
impossible
that
should
miss
shot
that
could
fail
wounding
three
four
them
the
first
shot
this
place
then
resolved
fulfil
design
and
accordingly
prepared
two
muskets
and
ordinary
fowling
piece
the
two
muskets
loaded
with
brace
slugs
each
and
four
five
smaller
bullets
about
the
size
pistol
bullets
and
the
fowling
piece
loaded
with
near
handful
swan
shot
the
largest
size
also
loaded
pistols
with
about
four
bullets
each
and
this
posture
well
provided
with
ammunition
for
second
and
third
charge
prepared
myself
for
expedition
after
had
thus
laid
the
scheme
design
and
imagination
put
practice
continually
made
tour
every
morning
the
top
the
hill
which
was
from
castle
called
about
three
miles
more
see
could
observe
any
boats
upon
the
sea
coming
near
the
island
standing
over
towards
but
began
tire
this
hard
duty
after
had
for
two
three
months
constantly
kept
watch
but
came
always
back
without
any
discovery
there
having
not
all
that
time
been
the
least
appearance
not
only
near
the
shore
but
the
whole
ocean
far
eye
glass
could
reach
every
way
long
kept
daily
tour
the
hill
look
out
long
also
kept
the
vigour
design
and
spirits
seemed
all
the
while
suitable
frame
for
outrageous
execution
the
killing
twenty
thirty
naked
savages
for
offence
which
had
not
all
entered
into
any
discussion
thoughts
any
farther
than
passions
were
first
fired
the
horror
conceived
the
unnatural
custom
the
people
that
country
who
seems
had
been
suffered
providence
his
wise
disposition
the
world
have
other
guide
than
that
their
own
abominable
and
vitiated
passions
and
consequently
were
left
and
perhaps
had
been
for
some
ages
act
such
horrid
things
and
receive
such
dreadful
customs
nothing
but
nature
entirely
abandoned
heaven
and
actuated
some
hellish
degeneracy
could
have
run
them
into
but
now
when
have
said
began
weary
the
fruitless
excursion
which
had
made
long
and
far
every
morning
vain
opinion
the
action
itself
began
alter
and
began
with
cooler
and
calmer
thoughts
consider
what
was
going
engage
what
authority
call
had
pretend
judge
and
executioner
upon
these
men
criminals
whom
heaven
had
thought
fit
for
many
ages
suffer
unpunished
and
were
the
executioners
his
judgments
one
upon
another
how
far
these
people
were
offenders
against
and
what
right
had
engage
the
quarrel
that
blood
which
they
shed
promiscuously
upon
one
another
debated
this
very
often
with
myself
thus
how
know
what
god
himself
judges
this
particular
case
certain
these
people
not
commit
this
crime
not
against
their
own
consciences
reproving
their
light
reproaching
them
they
not
know
offence
and
then
commit
defiance
divine
justice
almost
all
the
sins
commit
they
think
more
crime
kill
captive
taken
war
than
kill
eat
human
flesh
than
eat
mutton
when
considered
this
little
followed
necessarily
that
was
certainly
the
wrong
that
these
people
were
not
murderers
the
sense
that
had
before
condemned
them
thoughts
any
more
than
those
christians
were
murderers
who
often
put
death
the
prisoners
taken
battle
more
frequently
upon
many
occasions
put
whole
troops
men
the
sword
without
giving
quarter
though
they
threw
down
their
arms
and
submitted
the
next
place
occurred
that
although
the
usage
they
gave
one
another
was
thus
brutish
and
inhuman
yet
was
really
nothing
these
people
had
done
injury
that
they
attempted
saw
necessary
for
immediate
preservation
fall
upon
them
something
might
said
for
but
that
was
yet
out
their
power
and
they
really
had
knowledge
and
consequently
design
upon
and
therefore
could
not
just
for
fall
upon
them
that
this
would
justify
the
conduct
the
spaniards
all
their
barbarities
practised
america
where
they
destroyed
millions
these
people
who
however
they
were
idolators
and
barbarians
and
had
several
bloody
and
barbarous
rites
their
customs
such
sacrificing
human
bodies
their
idols
were
yet
the
spaniards
very
innocent
people
and
that
the
rooting
them
out
the
country
spoken
with
the
utmost
abhorrence
and
detestation
even
the
spaniards
themselves
this
time
and
all
other
christian
nations
europe
mere
butchery
bloody
and
unnatural
piece
cruelty
unjustifiable
either
god
man
and
for
which
the
very
name
spaniard
reckoned
frightful
and
terrible
all
people
humanity
christian
compassion
the
kingdom
spain
were
particularly
eminent
for
the
produce
race
men
who
were
without
principles
tenderness
the
common
bowels
pity
the
miserable
which
reckoned
mark
generous
temper
the
mind
these
considerations
really
put
pause
and
kind
full
stop
and
began
little
and
little
off
design
and
conclude
had
taken
wrong
measures
resolution
attack
the
savages
and
that
was
not
business
meddle
with
them
unless
they
first
attacked
and
this
was
business
possible
prevent
but
that
were
discovered
and
attacked
them
knew
duty
the
other
hand
argued
with
myself
that
this
really
was
the
way
not
deliver
myself
but
entirely
ruin
and
destroy
myself
for
unless
was
sure
kill
every
one
that
not
only
should
shore
that
time
but
that
should
ever
come
shore
afterwards
but
one
them
escaped
tell
their
country
people
what
had
happened
they
would
come
over
again
thousands
revenge
the
death
their
fellows
and
should
only
bring
upon
myself
certain
destruction
which
present
had
manner
occasion
for
upon
the
whole
concluded
that
ought
neither
principle
nor
policy
one
way
other
concern
myself
this
affair
that
business
was
all
possible
means
conceal
myself
from
them
and
not
leave
the
least
sign
for
them
guess
that
there
were
any
living
creatures
upon
the
island
mean
human
shape
religion
joined
with
this
prudential
resolution
and
was
convinced
now
many
ways
that
was
perfectly
out
duty
when
was
laying
all
bloody
schemes
for
the
destruction
innocent
creatures
mean
innocent
the
crimes
they
were
guilty
towards
one
another
had
nothing
with
them
they
were
national
and
ought
leave
them
the
justice
god
who
the
governor
nations
and
knows
how
national
punishments
make
just
retribution
for
national
offences
and
bring
public
judgments
upon
those
who
offend
public
manner
such
ways
best
please
him
this
appeared
clear
now
that
nothing
was
greater
satisfaction
than
that
had
not
been
suffered
thing
which
now
saw
much
reason
believe
would
have
been
less
sin
than
that
wilful
murder
had
committed
and
gave
most
humble
thanks
knees
god
that
had
thus
delivered
from
blood
guiltiness
beseeching
him
grant
the
protection
his
providence
that
might
not
fall
into
the
hands
the
barbarians
that
might
not
lay
hands
upon
them
unless
had
more
clear
call
from
heaven
defence
own
life
this
disposition
continued
for
near
year
after
this
and
far
was
from
desiring
occasion
for
falling
upon
these
wretches
that
all
that
time
never
once
went
the
hill
see
whether
there
were
any
them
sight
know
whether
any
them
had
been
shore
there
not
that
might
not
tempted
renew
any
contrivances
against
them
provoked
any
advantage
that
might
present
itself
fall
upon
them
only
this
did
went
and
removed
boat
which
had
the
other
side
the
island
and
carried
down
the
east
end
the
whole
island
where
ran
into
little
cove
which
found
under
some
high
rocks
and
where
knew
reason
the
currents
the
savages
durst
not
least
would
not
come
with
their
boats
upon
any
account
whatever
with
boat
carried
away
everything
that
had
left
there
belonging
her
though
not
necessary
for
the
bare
going
thither
viz
mast
and
sail
which
had
made
for
her
and
thing
like
anchor
but
which
indeed
could
not
called
either
anchor
grapnel
however
was
the
best
could
make
its
kind
all
these
removed
that
there
might
not
the
least
shadow
for
discovery
appearance
any
boat
any
human
habitation
upon
the
island
besides
this
kept
myself
said
more
retired
than
ever
and
seldom
went
from
cell
except
upon
constant
employment
milk
she
goats
and
manage
little
flock
the
wood
which
was
quite
the
other
part
the
island
was
out
danger
for
certain
that
these
savage
people
who
sometimes
haunted
this
island
never
came
with
any
thoughts
finding
anything
here
and
consequently
never
wandered
off
from
the
coast
and
doubt
not
but
they
might
have
been
several
times
shore
after
apprehensions
them
had
made
cautious
well
before
indeed
looked
back
with
some
horror
upon
the
thoughts
what
condition
would
have
been
had
chopped
upon
them
and
been
discovered
before
that
when
naked
and
unarmed
except
with
one
gun
and
that
loaded
often
only
with
small
shot
walked
everywhere
peeping
and
peering
about
the
island
see
what
could
get
what
surprise
should
have
been
when
discovered
the
print
man
foot
had
instead
that
seen
fifteen
twenty
savages
and
found
them
pursuing
and
the
swiftness
their
running
possibility
escaping
them
the
thoughts
this
sometimes
sank
very
soul
within
and
distressed
mind
much
that
could
not
soon
recover
think
what
should
have
done
and
how
should
not
only
have
been
unable
resist
them
but
even
should
not
have
had
presence
mind
enough
what
might
have
done
much
less
what
now
after
much
consideration
and
preparation
might
able
indeed
after
serious
thinking
these
things
would
melancholy
and
sometimes
would
last
great
while
but
resolved
all
last
into
thankfulness
that
providence
which
had
delivered
from
many
unseen
dangers
and
had
kept
from
those
mischiefs
which
could
have
way
been
the
agent
delivering
myself
from
because
had
not
the
least
notion
any
such
thing
depending
the
least
supposition
its
being
possible
this
renewed
contemplation
which
often
had
come
into
thoughts
former
times
when
first
began
see
the
merciful
dispositions
heaven
the
dangers
run
through
this
life
how
wonderfully
are
delivered
when
know
nothing
how
when
are
quandary
call
doubt
hesitation
whether
this
way
that
way
secret
hint
shall
direct
this
way
when
intended
that
way
nay
when
sense
our
own
inclination
and
perhaps
business
has
called
the
other
way
yet
strange
impression
upon
the
mind
from
know
not
what
springs
and
know
not
what
power
shall
overrule
this
way
and
shall
afterwards
appear
that
had
gone
that
way
which
should
have
gone
and
even
our
imagination
ought
have
gone
should
have
been
ruined
and
lost
upon
these
and
many
like
reflections
afterwards
made
certain
rule
with
that
whenever
found
those
secret
hints
pressings
mind
doing
not
doing
anything
that
presented
going
this
way
that
way
never
failed
obey
the
secret
dictate
though
knew
other
reason
for
than
such
pressure
such
hint
hung
upon
mind
could
give
many
examples
the
success
this
conduct
the
course
life
but
more
especially
the
latter
part
inhabiting
this
unhappy
island
besides
many
occasions
which
very
likely
might
have
taken
notice
had
seen
with
the
same
eyes
then
that
see
with
now
but
never
too
late
wise
and
cannot
but
advise
all
considering
men
whose
lives
are
attended
with
such
extraordinary
incidents
mine
even
though
not
extraordinary
not
slight
such
secret
intimations
providence
let
them
come
from
what
invisible
intelligence
they
will
that
shall
not
discuss
and
perhaps
cannot
account
for
but
certainly
they
are
proof
the
converse
spirits
and
secret
communication
between
those
embodied
and
those
unembodied
and
such
proof
can
never
withstood
which
shall
have
occasion
give
some
remarkable
instances
the
remainder
solitary
residence
this
dismal
place
believe
the
reader
this
will
not
think
strange
confess
that
these
anxieties
these
constant
dangers
lived
and
the
concern
that
was
now
upon
put
end
all
invention
and
all
the
contrivances
that
had
laid
for
future
accommodations
and
conveniences
had
the
care
safety
more
now
upon
hands
than
that
food
cared
not
drive
nail
chop
stick
wood
now
for
fear
the
noise
might
make
should
heard
much
less
would
fire
gun
for
the
same
reason
and
above
all
was
intolerably
uneasy
making
any
fire
lest
the
smoke
which
visible
great
distance
the
day
should
betray
for
this
reason
removed
that
part
business
which
required
fire
such
burning
pots
and
pipes
into
new
apartment
the
woods
where
after
had
been
some
time
found
unspeakable
consolation
mere
natural
cave
the
earth
which
went
vast
way
and
where
daresay
savage
had
been
the
mouth
would
hardy
venture
nor
indeed
would
any
man
else
but
one
who
like
wanted
nothing
much
safe
retreat
the
mouth
this
hollow
was
the
bottom
great
rock
where
mere
accident
would
say
did
not
see
abundant
reason
ascribe
all
such
things
now
providence
was
cutting
down
some
thick
branches
trees
make
charcoal
and
before
must
observe
the
reason
making
this
charcoal
which
was
this
was
afraid
making
smoke
about
habitation
said
before
and
yet
could
not
live
there
without
baking
bread
cooking
meat
contrived
burn
some
wood
here
had
seen
done
england
under
turf
till
became
chark
dry
coal
and
then
putting
the
fire
out
preserved
the
coal
carry
home
and
perform
the
other
services
for
which
fire
was
wanting
without
danger
smoke
but
this
the
bye
while
was
cutting
down
some
wood
here
perceived
that
behind
very
thick
branch
low
brushwood
underwood
there
was
kind
hollow
place
was
curious
look
and
getting
with
difficulty
into
the
mouth
found
was
pretty
large
that
say
sufficient
for
stand
upright
and
perhaps
another
with
but
must
confess
you
that
made
more
haste
out
than
did
when
looking
farther
into
the
place
and
which
was
perfectly
dark
saw
two
broad
shining
eyes
some
creature
whether
devil
man
knew
not
which
twinkled
like
two
stars
the
dim
light
from
the
cave
mouth
shining
directly
and
making
the
reflection
however
after
some
pause
recovered
myself
and
began
call
myself
thousand
fools
and
think
that
that
was
afraid
see
the
devil
was
not
fit
live
twenty
years
island
all
alone
and
that
might
well
think
there
was
nothing
this
cave
that
was
more
frightful
than
myself
upon
this
plucking
courage
took
firebrand
and
rushed
again
with
the
stick
flaming
hand
had
not
gone
three
steps
before
was
almost
frightened
before
for
heard
very
loud
sigh
like
that
man
some
pain
and
was
followed
broken
noise
words
half
expressed
and
then
deep
sigh
again
stepped
back
and
was
indeed
struck
with
such
surprise
that
put
into
cold
sweat
and
had
had
hat
head
will
not
answer
for
that
hair
might
not
have
lifted
off
but
still
plucking
spirits
well
could
and
encouraging
myself
little
with
considering
that
the
power
and
presence
god
was
everywhere
and
was
able
protect
stepped
forward
again
and
the
light
the
firebrand
holding
little
over
head
saw
lying
the
ground
monstrous
frightful
old
goat
just
making
his
will
say
and
gasping
for
life
and
dying
indeed
mere
old
age
stirred
him
little
see
could
get
him
out
and
essayed
get
but
was
not
able
raise
himself
and
thought
with
myself
might
even
lie
there
for
had
frightened
would
certainly
fright
any
the
savages
any
them
should
hardy
come
there
while
had
any
life
him
was
now
recovered
from
surprise
and
began
look
round
when
found
the
cave
was
but
very
small
that
say
might
about
twelve
feet
over
but
manner
shape
neither
round
nor
square
hands
having
ever
been
employed
making
but
those
mere
nature
observed
also
that
there
was
place
the
farther
side
that
went
further
but
was
low
that
required
creep
upon
hands
and
knees
into
and
whither
went
knew
not
having
candle
gave
over
for
that
time
but
resolved
again
the
next
day
provided
with
candles
and
tinder
box
which
had
made
the
lock
one
the
muskets
with
some
wildfire
the
pan
accordingly
the
next

but
was
hard
set
for
candle
wick
using
sometimes
rags
rope
yarn
and
sometimes
the
dried
rind
weed
like
nettles
and
going
into
this
low
place
was
obliged
creep
upon
all
fours
have
said
almost
ten
yards
which
the
way
thought
was
venture
bold
enough
considering
that
knew
not
how
far
might
nor
what
was
beyond
when
had
got
through
the
strait
found
the
roof
rose
higher
believe
near
twenty
feet
but
never
was
such
glorious
sight
seen
the
island
daresay
was
look
round
the
sides
and
roof
this
vault
cave
the
wall
reflected
hundred
thousand
lights
from
two
candles
what
was
the

whether
diamonds
any
other
precious

gold
which
rather
supposed
knew
not
the
place
was
was
most
delightful
cavity
grotto
though
perfectly
dark
the
floor
was
dry
and
level
and
had
sort
small
loose
gravel
upon
that
there
was
nauseous
venomous
creature
seen
neither
was
there
any
damp
wet
the
sides
roof
the
only
difficulty
was
the
entrance
which
however
was
place
security
and
such
retreat
wanted
thought
was
convenience
that
was
really
rejoiced
the
discovery
and
resolved
without
any
delay
bring
some
those
things
which
was
most
anxious
about
this
place
particularly
resolved
bring
hither
magazine
powder
and
all
spare
arms
viz
two
fowling
pieces
for
had
three
all
and
three
muskets
for
them
had
eight
all
kept

only
five
which
stood
ready
mounted
like
pieces
cannon
outmost
fence
and
were
ready
also
take
out
upon
any
expedition
upon
this
occasion
removing
ammunition
happened
open
the
barrel
powder
which
took
out
the
sea
and
which
had
been
wet
and
found
that
the
water
had
penetrated
about
three
four
inches
into
the
powder
every
side
which
caking
and
growing
hard
had
preserved
the
inside
like

that
had
near
sixty
pounds
very
good
powder
the

this
was
very
agreeable
discovery
that
time
carried
all
away
thither
never
keeping
above
two
three

with
castle
for
fear
surprise
any
kind
also
carried
thither
all
the

left

fancied
myself
now
like
one
the
ancient
giants
who
were
said
live
caves
and
holes
the
rocks
where
none
could
come
them
for
persuaded
myself
while
was
here
that
five
hundred
savages
were
hunt
they
could
never
find
out
they
did
they
would
not
venture
attack
here
the
old
goat
whom
found
expiring
died
the
mouth
the
cave
the
next
day
after
made
this
discovery
and
found
much
easier
dig
great
hole
there
and
throw
him
and
cover
him
with
earth
than
drag
him
out
interred

there
even
the

till
had
laid
down
and
died
like
the
old

the

had
also
arrived
some
little
diversions
and
amusements
which
made
the
time
pass
great
deal
more
pleasantly
with
than
did
before
first
had
taught
poll
noted
before

and
did
familiarly
and
talked
articulately
and
plain
that
was
very
pleasant
and
lived
with
less
than
six

long
might
have

not

was
pleasant
and
loving
companion
for
less
than
sixteen
years
time
and
then
died
mere
old
age
for
cats
they
multiplied
have
observed
that
degree
that
was
obliged
shoot
several
them
first
keep
them
from
devouring
and
all
had
but
length
when
the
two
old
ones
brought
with
were
gone
and
after
some
time
continually
driving
them
from
and
letting
them
have
provision
with
they
all
ran
wild
into
the
woods
except
two
three
favourites
which
kept
tame
and
whose
young
when
they
had
any
always
drowned
and
these
were
part
family
besides
these
always
kept
two
three
household
kids
about
whom
taught
feed
out
hand
and
had
two
more
parrots
which
talked
pretty
well
and
would
all
call
robin
crusoe
but
none
like
first
nor
indeed
did
take
the
pains
with
any
them
that
had
done
with
him
had
also
several
tame
sea
fowls
whose
name
knew
not
that
caught
upon
the
shore
and
cut
their
wings
and
the
little
stakes
which
had
planted
before
castle
wall
being
now
grown
good
thick
grove
these
fowls
all
lived
among
these
low
trees
and
bred
there
which
was
very
agreeable
that
said
above
began
very
well
contented
with
the
life
led
could
have
been
secured
from
the
dread
the
savages
but
was
otherwise
directed
and
may
not
amiss
for
all
people
who
shall
meet
with
story
make
this
just
observation
from
how
frequently
the
course
our
lives
the
evil
which
itself
seek
most
shun
and
which
when
are
fallen
into
the
most
dreadful
oftentimes
the
very
means
door
our
deliverance
which
alone
can
raised
again
from
the
affliction
are
fallen
into
could
give
many
examples
this
the
course
unaccountable
life
but
nothing
was
more
particularly
remarkable
than
the
circumstances
last
years
solitary
residence
this
island
was
now
the
month
december
said
above
twenty
third
year
and
this
being
the
southern
solstice
for
winter
cannot
call
was
the
particular
time
harvest
and
required
pretty
much
abroad
the
fields
when
going
out
early
the
morning
even
before
was
thorough
daylight
was
surprised
with
seeing
light
some
fire
upon
the
shore
distance
from
about
two
miles
toward
that
part
the
island
where
had
observed
some
savages
had
been
before
and
not
the
other
side
but
great
affliction
was
side
the
island
was
indeed
terribly
surprised
the
sight
and
stopped
short
within
grove
not
daring
out
lest
might
surprised
and
yet
had
more
peace
within
from
the
apprehensions
had
that
these
savages
rambling
over
the
island
should
find
corn
standing
cut
any
works
improvements
they
would
immediately
conclude
that
there
were
people
the
place
and
would
then
never
rest
till
they
had
found
out
this
extremity
went
back
directly
castle
pulled
the
ladder
after
and
made
all
things
without
look
wild
and
natural
could
then
prepared
myself
within
putting
myself
posture
defence
loaded
all
cannon
called
them
that
say
muskets
which
were
mounted
upon
new
fortification
and
all
pistols
and
resolved
defend
myself
the
last
gasp
not
forgetting
seriously
commend
myself
the
divine
protection
and
earnestly
pray
god
deliver
out
the
hands
the
barbarians
continued
this
posture
about
two
hours
and
began
impatient
for
intelligence
abroad
for
had
spies
send
out
after
sitting
while
longer
and
musing
what
should
this
case
was
not
able
bear
sitting
ignorance
longer
setting
ladder
the
side
the
hill
where
there
was
flat
place
observed
before
and
then
pulling
the
ladder
after
set
again
and
mounted
the
top
the
hill
and
pulling
out
perspective
glass
which
had
taken
purpose
laid
down
flat
belly
the
ground
and
began
look
for
the
place
presently
found
there
were
less
than
nine
naked
savages
sitting
round
small
fire
they
had
made
not
warm
them
for
they
had
need
that
the
weather
being
extremely
hot
but
supposed
dress
some
their
barbarous
diet
human
flesh
which
they
had
brought
with
them
whether
alive
dead
could
not
tell
they
had
two
canoes
with
them
which
they
had
hauled
upon
the
shore
and
was
then
ebb
tide
they
seemed
wait
for
the
return
the
flood
away
again
not
easy
imagine
what
confusion
this
sight
put
into
especially
seeing
them
come
side
the
island
and
near
but
when
considered
their
coming
must
always
with
the
current
the
ebb
began
afterwards
more
sedate
mind
being
satisfied
that
might
abroad
with
safety
all
the
time
the
flood
tide
they
were
not
shore
before
and
having
made
this
observation
went
abroad
about
harvest
work
with
the
more
composure
expected
proved
for
soon
the
tide
made
the
westward
saw
them
all
take
boat
and
row
paddle
call
away
should
have
observed
that
for
hour
more
before
they
went
off
they
were
dancing
and
could
easily
discern
their
postures
and
gestures
glass
could
not
perceive
nicest
observation
but
that
they
were
stark
naked
and
had
not
the
least
covering
upon
them
but
whether
they
were
men
women
could
not
distinguish
soon
saw
them
shipped
and
gone
took
two
guns
upon
shoulders
and
two
pistols
girdle
and
great
sword
side
without
scabbard
and
with
all
the
speed
was
able
make
went
away
the
hill
where
had
discovered
the
first
appearance
all
and
soon
get
thither
which
was
not
less
than
two
hours
for
could
not
quickly
being
loaded
with
arms
was
perceived
there
had
been
three
canoes
more
the
savages
that
place
and
looking
out
farther
saw
they
were
all
sea
together
making
over
for
the
main
this
was
dreadful
sight
especially
going
down
the
shore
could
see
the
marks
horror
which
the
dismal
work
they
had
been
about
had
left
behind
viz
the
blood
the
bones
and
part
the
flesh
human
bodies
eaten
and
devoured
those
wretches
with
merriment
and
sport
was
filled
with
indignation
the
sight
that
now
began
premeditate
the
destruction
the
next
that
saw
there
let
them
whom
how
many
soever
seemed
evident
that
the
visits
which
they
made
thus
this
island
were
not
very
frequent
for
was
above
fifteen
months
before
any
more
them
came
shore
there
again
that
say
neither
saw
them
nor
any
footsteps
signals
them
all
that
time
for
the
rainy
seasons
then
they
are
sure
not
come
abroad
least
not
far
yet
all
this
while
lived
uncomfortably
reason
the
constant
apprehensions
their
coming
upon
surprise
from
whence
observe
that
the
expectation
evil
more
bitter
than
the
suffering
especially
there
room
shake
off
that
expectation
those
apprehensions
during
all
this
time
was
murdering
humour
and
spent
most
hours
which
should
have
been
better
employed
contriving
how
circumvent
and
fall
upon
them
the
very
next
time
should
see
them
especially
they
should
divided
they
were
the
last
time
into
two
parties
nor
did
consider
all
that
killed
one
party
suppose
ten
dozen
was
still
the
next
day
week
month
kill
another
and
another
even
infinitum
till
should
length
less
murderer
than
they
were
being
man
eaters
and
perhaps
much
more
spent
days
now
great
perplexity
and
anxiety
mind
expecting
that
should
one
day
other
fall
into
the
hands
these
merciless
creatures
and
did
any
time
venture
abroad
was
not
without
looking
around
with
the
greatest
care
and
caution
imaginable
and
now
found
great
comfort
how
happy
was
that
had
provided
tame
flock
herd
goats
for
durst
not
upon
any
account
fire
gun
especially
near
that
side
the
island
where
they
usually
came
lest
should
alarm
the
savages
and
they
had
fled
from
now
was
sure
have
them
come
again
with
perhaps
two
three
hundred
canoes
with
them
few
days
and
then
knew
what
expect
however
wore
out
year
and
three
months
more
before
ever
saw
any
more
the
savages
and
then
found
them
again
shall
soon
observe
true
they
might
have
been
there
once
twice
but
either
they
made
stay
least
did
not
see
them
but
the
month
may
near
could
calculate
and
four
and
twentieth
year
had
very
strange
encounter
with
them
which
its
place
the
perturbation
mind
during
this
fifteen
sixteen
months
interval
was
very
great
slept
unquietly
dreamed
always
frightful
dreams
and
often
started
out
sleep
the
night
the
day
great
troubles
overwhelmed
mind
and
the
night
dreamed
often
killing
the
savages
and
the
reasons
why
might
justify
doing
but
waive
all
this
for
while
was
the
middle
may
the
sixteenth
day
think
well
poor
wooden
calendar
would
reckon
for
marked
all
upon
the
post
still
say
was
the
sixteenth
may
that
blew
very
great
storm
wind
all
day
with
great
deal
lightning
and
thunder
and
very
foul
night
was
after
knew
not
what
was
the
particular
occasion
but
was
reading
the
bible
and
taken
with
very
serious
thoughts
about
present
condition
was
surprised
with
the
noise
gun
thought
fired
sea
this
was
sure
surprise
quite
different
nature
from
any
had
met
with
before
for
the
notions
this
put
into
thoughts
were
quite
another
kind
started
the
greatest
haste
imaginable
and
trice
clapped
ladder
the
middle
place
the
rock
and
pulled
after
and
mounting
the
second
time
got
the
top
the
hill
the
very
moment
that
flash
fire
bid
listen
for
second
gun
which
accordingly
about
half
minute
heard
and
the
sound
knew
that
was
from
that
part
the
sea
where
was
driven
down
the
current
boat
immediately
considered
that
this
must
some
ship
distress
and
that
they
had
some
comrade
some
other
ship
company
and
fired
these
for
signals
distress
and
obtain
help
had
the
presence
mind
that
minute
think
that
though
could
not
help
them
might
that
they
might
help
brought
together
all
the
dry
wood
could
get
hand
and
making
good
handsome
pile
set
fire
upon
the
hill
the
wood
was
dry
and
blazed
freely
and
though
the
wind
blew
very
hard
yet
burned
fairly
out
that
was
certain
there
was
any
such
thing
ship
they
must
needs
see
and
doubt
they
did
for
soon
ever
fire
blazed
heard
another
gun
and
after
that
several
others
all
from
the
same
quarter
plied
fire
all
night
long
till
daybreak
and
when
was
broad
day
and
the
air
cleared
saw
something
great
distance
sea
full
east
the
island
whether
sail
hull
could
not
distinguish
not
with
glass
the
distance
was
great
and
the
weather
still
something
hazy
also
least
was
out
sea
looked
frequently
all
that
day
and
soon
perceived
that
did
not
move
presently
concluded
that
was
ship
anchor
and
being
eager
you
may
sure
satisfied
took
gun
hand
and
ran
towards
the
south
side
the
island
the
rocks
where
had
formerly
been
carried
away
the
current
and
getting
there
the
weather
this
time
being
perfectly
clear
could
plainly
see
great
sorrow
the
wreck
ship
cast
away
the
night
upon
those
concealed
rocks
which
found
when
was
out
boat
and
which
rocks
they
checked
the
violence
the
stream
and
made
kind
counter
stream
eddy
were
the
occasion
recovering
from
the
most
desperate
hopeless
condition
that
ever
had
been
all
life
thus
what
one
man
safety
another
man
destruction
for
seems
these
men
whoever
they
were
being
out
their
knowledge
and
the
rocks
being
wholly
under
water
had
been
driven
upon
them
the
night
the
wind
blowing
hard
ene
had
they
seen
the
island
must
necessarily
suppose
they
did
not
they
must
thought
have
endeavoured
have
saved
themselves
shore
the
help
their
boat
but
their
firing
off
guns
for
help
especially
when
they
saw
imagined
fire
filled
with
many
thoughts
first
imagined
that
upon
seeing
light
they
might
have
put
themselves
into
their
boat
and
endeavoured
make
the
shore
but
that
the
sea
running
very
high
they
might
have
been
cast
away
other
times
imagined
that
they
might
have
lost
their
boat
before
might
the
case
many
ways
particularly
the
breaking
the
sea
upon
their
ship
which
many
times
obliged
men
stave
take
pieces
their
boat
and
sometimes
throw
overboard
with
their
own
hands
other
times
imagined
they
had
some
other
ship
ships
company
who
upon
the
signals
distress
they
made
had
taken
them
and
carried
them
off
other
times
fancied
they
were
all
gone
off
sea
their
boat
and
being
hurried
away
the
current
that
had
been
formerly
were
carried
out
into
the
great
ocean
where
there
was
nothing
but
misery
and
perishing
and
that
perhaps
they
might
this
time
think
starving
and
being
condition
eat
one
another
all
these
were
but
conjectures
best
the
condition
was
could
more
than
look
upon
the
misery
the
poor
men
and
pity
them
which
had
still
this
good
effect
upon
side
that
gave
more
and
more
cause
give
thanks
god
who
had
happily
and
comfortably
provided
for
desolate
condition
and
that
two
ships
companies
who
were
now
cast
away
upon
this
part
the
world
not
one
life
should
spared
but
mine
learned
here
again
observe
that
very
rare
that
the
providence
god
casts
into
any
condition
low
any
misery
great
but
may
see
something
other
thankful
for
and
may
see
others
worse
circumstances
than
our
own
such
certainly
was
the
case
these
men
whom
could
not
much

only
their
being

another

this

possibility
indeed
for

not

any
such
thing
cannot
explain
any

energy
words
what
strange
longing
felt
soul
upon
this
sight
breaking
out
sometimes
thus
that
there

nay
but

one

the

there
are
some
secret
springs
the

when

insupportable

that
but
one

believe
repeated
the
words
that
had
been

one
thousand
times

were

that

strong
that
for
some

could
not
part
them
again
let
the
naturalists
explain
these
things
and
the
reason
and
manner
them
all
can
describe
the
fact
which
was
even
surprising
when
found
though
knew
not
from
whence
proceeded
was
doubtless
the
effect
ardent
wishes
and
strong
ideas
formed
mind
realising
the
comfort
which
the
conversation
one
fellow
christians
would
have
been
but
was
not
either
their
fate
mine
both
forbade
for
till
the
last
year
being
this
island
never
knew
whether
any
were
saved
out
that
ship
and
had
only
the
affliction
some
days
after
see
the
corpse
drowned
boy
come
shore
the
end
the
island
which
was
next
the
shipwreck
had
clothes
but
seaman
waistcoat
pair
open
kneed
linen
drawers
and
blue
linen
shirt
but
nothing
direct
much
guess
what
nation
was
had
nothing
his
pockets
but
two
pieces
eight
and
tobacco
pipe
the
last
was
ten
times
more
value
than
the
first
was
now
calm
and
had
great
mind
venture
out
boat
this
wreck
not
doubting
but
might
find
something
board
that
might
useful
but
that
did
not
altogether
press
much
the
possibility
that
there
might
yet
some
living
creature
board
whose
life
might
not
only
save
but
might
saving
that
life
comfort
own
the
last
degree
and
this
thought
clung
heart
that
could
not
quiet
night
day
but
must
venture
out
boat
board
this
wreck
and
committing
the
rest
god
providence
thought
the
impression
was
strong
upon
mind
that
could
not
resisted
that
must
come
from
some
invisible
direction
and
that
should
wanting
myself
did
not
under
the
power
this
impression
hastened
back
castle
prepared
everything
for
voyage
took
quantity
bread
great
pot
fresh
water
compass
steer
bottle
rum
for
had
still
great
deal
that
left
and
basket
raisins
and
thus
loading
myself
with
everything
necessary
went
down
boat
got
the
water
out
her
got
her
afloat
loaded
all
cargo
her
and
then
went
home
again
for
more
second
cargo
was
great
bag
rice
the
umbrella
set
over
head
for
shade
another
large
pot
water
and
about
two
dozen
small
loaves
barley
cakes
more
than
before
with
bottle
goat
milk
and
cheese
all
which
with
great
labour
and
sweat
carried
boat
and
praying
god
direct
voyage
put
out
and
rowing
paddling
the
canoe
along
the
shore
came
last
the
utmost
point
the
island
the
north
east
side
and
now
was
launch
out
into
the
ocean
and
either
venture
not
venture
looked
the
rapid
currents
which
ran
constantly
both
sides
the
island
distance
and
which
were
very
terrible
from
the
remembrance
the
hazard
had
been
before
and
heart
began
fail
for
foresaw
that
was
driven
into
either
those
currents
should
carried
great
way
out
sea
and
perhaps
out
reach
sight
the
island
again
and
that
then
boat
was
but
small
any
little
gale
wind
should
rise
should
inevitably
lost
these
thoughts
oppressed
mind
that
began
give
over
enterprise
and
having
hauled
boat
into
little
creek
the
shore
stepped
out
and
sat
down
upon
rising
bit
ground
very
pensive
and
anxious
between
fear
and
desire
about
voyage
when
was
musing
could
perceive
that
the
tide
was
turned
and
the
flood
come
upon
which
going
was
impracticable
for
many
hours
upon
this
presently
occurred
that
should
the
highest
piece
ground
could
find
and
observe
could
how
the
sets
the
tide
currents
lay
when
the
flood
came
that
might
judge
whether
was
driven
one
way
out
might
not
expect
driven
another
way
home
with
the
same
rapidity
the
currents
this
thought
was
sooner
head
than
cast
eye
upon
little
hill
which
sufficiently
overlooked
the
sea
both
ways
and
from
whence
had
clear
view
the
currents
sets
the
tide
and
which
way
was
guide
myself
return
here
found
that
the
current
ebb
set
out
close
the
south
point
the
island
the
current
the
flood
set
close
the
shore
the
north
side
and
that
had
nothing
but
keep
the
north
side
the
island
return
and
should
well
enough
encouraged
this
observation
resolved
the
next
morning
set
out
with
the
first
the
tide
and
reposing
myself
for
the
night
canoe
under
the
watch
coat
mentioned
launched
out
first
made
little
out
sea
full
north
till
began
feel
the
benefit
the
current
which
set
eastward
and
which
carried
great
rate
and
yet
did
not
hurry
the
current
the
south
side
had
done
before
take
from
all
government
the
boat
but
having
strong
steerage
with
paddle
went
great
rate
directly
for
the
wreck
and
less
than
two
hours
came
was
dismal
sight
look
the
ship
which
its
building
was
spanish
stuck
fast
jammed
between
two
rocks
all
the
stern
and
quarter
her
were
beaten
pieces
the
sea
and
her
forecastle
which
stuck
the
rocks
had
run
with
great
violence
her
mainmast
and
foremast
were
brought
the
board
that
say
broken
short
off
but
her
bowsprit
was
sound
and
the
head
and
bow
appeared
firm
when
came
close
her
dog
appeared
upon
her
who
seeing
coming
yelped
and
cried
and
soon
called
him
jumped
into
the
sea
come
took
him
into
the
boat
but
found
him
almost
dead
with
hunger
and
thirst
gave
him
cake
bread
and
devoured
like
ravenous
wolf
that
had
been
starving
fortnight
the
snow
then
gave
the
poor
creature
some
fresh
water
with
which
would
have
let
him
would
have
burst
himself
after
this
went
board
but
the
first
sight
met
with
was
two
men
drowned
the
cook
room
forecastle
the
ship
with
their
arms
fast
about
one
another
concluded
indeed
probable
that
when
the
ship
struck
being
storm
the
sea
broke
high
and
continually
over
her
that
the
men
were
not
able
bear
and
were
strangled
with
the
constant
rushing
the
water
much
they
had
been
under
water
besides
the
dog
there
was
nothing
left
the
ship
that
had
life
nor
any
goods
that
could
see
but
what
were
spoiled
the
water
there
were
some
casks
liquor
whether
wine
brandy
knew
not
which
lay
lower
the
hold
and
which
the
water
being
ebbed
out
could
see
but
they
were
too
big
meddle
with
saw
several
chests
which
believe
belonged
some
the
seamen
and
got
two
them
into
the
boat
without
examining
what
was
them
had
the
stern
the
ship
been
fixed
and
the
forepart
broken
off
persuaded
might
have
made
good
voyage
for
what
found
those
two
chests
had
room
suppose
the
ship
had
great
deal
wealth
board
and
may
guess
from
the
course
she
steered
she
must
have
been
bound
from
buenos
ayres
the
rio
plata
the
south
part
america
beyond
the
brazils
the
havannah
the
gulf
mexico
and
perhaps
spain
she
had
doubt
great
treasure
her
but
use
that
time
anybody
and
what
became
the
crew
then
knew
not
found
besides
these
chests
little
cask
full
liquor
about
twenty
gallons
which
got
into
boat
with
much
difficulty
there
were
several
muskets
the
cabin
and
great
powder
horn
with
about
four
pounds
powder
for
the
muskets
had
occasion
for
them
left
them
but
took
the
powder
horn
took
fire
shovel
and
tongs
which
wanted
extremely
also
two
little
brass
kettles
copper
pot
make
chocolate
and
gridiron
and
with
this
cargo
and
the
dog
came
away
the
tide
beginning
make
home
again
and
the
same
evening
about
hour
within
night
reached
the
island
again
weary
and
fatigued
the
last
degree
reposed
that
night
the
boat
and
the
morning
resolved
harbour
what
had
got
new
cave
and
not
carry
home
castle
after
refreshing
myself
got
all
cargo
shore
and
began
examine
the
particulars
the
cask
liquor
found
kind
rum
but
not
such
had
the
brazils
and
word
not
all
good
but
when
came
open
the
chests
found
several
things
great
use
for
example
found
one
fine
case
bottles
extraordinary
kind
and
filled
with
cordial
waters
fine
and
very
good
the
bottles
held
about
three
pints
each
and
were
tipped
with
silver
found
two
pots
very
good
succades
sweetmeats
fastened
also
the
top
that
the
salt
water
had
not
hurt
them
and
two
more
the
same
which
the
water
had
spoiled
found
some
very
good
shirts
which
were
very
welcome
and
about
dozen
and
half
white
linen
handkerchiefs
and
coloured
neckcloths
the
former
were
also
very
welcome
being
exceedingly
refreshing
wipe
face
hot
day
besides
this
when
came
the
till
the
chest
found
there
three
great
bags
pieces
eight
which
held
about
eleven
hundred
pieces
all
and
one
them
wrapped
paper
six
doubloons
gold
and
some
small
bars
wedges
gold
suppose
they
might
all
weigh
near
pound
the
other
chest
were
some
clothes
but
little
value
but
the
circumstances
must
have
belonged
the
gunner
mate
though
there
was
powder
except
two
pounds
fine
glazed
powder
three
flasks
kept
suppose
for
charging
their
fowling
pieces
occasion
upon
the
whole
got
very
little
this
voyage
that
was
any
use
for
the
money
had
manner
occasion
for
was
the
dirt
under
feet
and
would
have
given
all
for
three
four
pair
english
shoes
and
stockings
which
were
things
greatly
wanted
but
had
had
none
feet
for
many
years
had
indeed
got
two
pair
shoes
now
which
took
off
the
feet
two
drowned
men
whom
saw
the
wreck
and
found
two
pair
more
one
the
chests
which
were
very
welcome
but
they
were
not
like
our
english
shoes
either
for
ease
service
being
rather
what
call
pumps
than
shoes
found
this
seaman
chest
about
fifty
pieces
eight
rials
but
gold
supposed
this
belonged
poorer

than
the
other
which
seemed
belong

this

before

that
the

reflections
upon

since

this

was
comparing
the

habitation
here
with
the
life
anxiety
fear
and
care
which
had
lived
ever

not
that
did
not
believe
the
savages
had
frequented
the
island
even
all
the
while
and
might
have
been
several
hundreds
them
times
shore
there
but
had
never
known
and
was
incapable
any
apprehensions
about
satisfaction
was
perfect
though
danger
was
the
same
and
was
happy
not
knowing
danger
had
never
really
been
exposed
this
furnished
thoughts
with
many
very
profitable
reflections
and
particularly
this
one
how
infinitely
good
that
providence
which
has
provided
its
government
mankind
such
narrow
bounds
his
sight
and
knowledge
things
and
though
walks
the
midst
many
thousand
dangers
the
sight
which
discovered
him
would
distract
his
mind
and
sink
his
spirits
kept
serene
and
calm
having
the
events
things
hid
from
his
eyes
and
knowing
nothing
the
dangers
which
surround
him
after
these
thoughts
had
for
some
time
entertained
came
reflect
seriously
upon
the
real
danger
had
been
for
many
years
this
very
island
and
how
had
walked
about
the
greatest
security
and
with
all
possible
tranquillity
even
when
perhaps
nothing
but
the
brow
hill
great
tree
the
casual
approach
night
had
been
between
and
the
worst
kind
destruction
viz
that
falling
into
the
hands
cannibals
and
savages
who
would
have
seized
with
the
same
view
would
goat
turtle
and
have
thought
more
crime
kill
and
devour
than
did
pigeon
curlew
would
unjustly
slander
myself
should
say
was
not
sincerely
thankful
great
preserver
whose
singular
protection
acknowledged
with
great
humanity
all
these
unknown
deliverances
were
due
and
without
which
must
inevitably
have
fallen
into
their
merciless
hands
when
these
thoughts
were
over
head
was
for
some
time
taken
considering
the
nature
these
wretched
creatures
mean
the
savages
and
how
came
pass
the
world
that
the
wise
governor
all
things
should
give
any
his
creatures
such
inhumanity
nay
something
much
below
even
brutality
itself
devour
its
own
kind
but
this
ended
some
that
time
fruitless
speculations
occurred
inquire
what
part
the
world
these
wretches
lived
how
far
off
the
coast
was
from
whence
they
came
what
they
ventured
over
far
from
home
for
what
kind
boats
they
had
and
why
might
not
order
myself
and
business
that
might
able
over
thither
they
were
come
never
much
troubled
myself
consider
what
should
with
myself
when
went
thither
what
would
become
fell
into
the
hands
these
savages
how
should
escape
them
they
attacked
nor
much
how
was
possible
for
reach
the
coast
and
not
attacked
some
other
them
without
any
possibility
delivering
myself
and
should
not
fall
into
their
hands
what
should
for
provision
whither
should
bend
course
none
these
thoughts
say
much
came
way
but
mind
was
wholly
bent
upon
the
notion
passing
over
boat
the
mainland
looked
upon
present
condition
the
most
miserable
that
could
possibly
that
was
not
able
throw
myself
into
anything
but
death
that
could
called
worse
and
reached
the
shore
the
main
might
perhaps
meet
with
relief
might
coast
along
did
the
african
shore
till
came
some
inhabited
country
and
where
might
find
some
relief
and
after
all
perhaps
might
fall
with
some
christian
ship
that
might
take
and
the
worst
came
the
worst
could
but
die
which
would
put
end
all
these
miseries
once
pray
note
all
this
was
the
fruit
disturbed
mind
impatient
temper
made
desperate
were
the
long
continuance
troubles
and
the
disappointments
had
met
the
wreck
had
been
board
and
where
had
been
near
obtaining
what
earnestly
longed
for
somebody
speak
and
learn
some
knowledge
from
them
the
place
where
was
and
the
probable
means
deliverance
was
agitated
wholly
these
thoughts
all
calm
mind
resignation
providence
and
waiting
the
issue
the
dispositions
heaven
seemed
suspended
and
had
were
power
turn
thoughts
anything
but
the
project
voyage
the
main
which
came
upon
with
such
force
and
such
impetuosity
desire
that
was
not
resisted
when
this
had
agitated
thoughts
for
two
hours
more
with
such
violence
that
set
very
blood
into
ferment
and
pulse
beat
had
been
fever
merely
with
the
extraordinary
fervour
mind
about
nature
had
been
fatigued
and
exhausted
with
the
very
thoughts
threw
into
sound
sleep
one
would
have
thought
should
have
dreamed
but
did
not
nor
anything
relating
but
dreamed
that
was
going
out
the
morning
usual
from
castle
saw
upon
the
shore
two
canoes
and
eleven
savages
coming
land
and
that
they
brought
with
them
another
savage
whom
they
were
going
kill
order
eat
him
when
sudden
the
savage
that
they
were
going
kill
jumped
away
and
ran
for
his
life
and
thought
sleep
that
came
running
into
little
thick
grove
before
fortification
hide
himself
and
that
seeing
him
alone
and
not
perceiving
that
the
others
sought
him
that
way
showed
myself
him
and
smiling
upon
him
encouraged
him
that
kneeled
down
seeming
pray
assist
him
upon
which
showed
him
ladder
made
him
and
carried
him
into
cave
and
became
servant
and
that
soon
had
got
this
man
said
myself
now
may
certainly
venture
the
mainland
for
this
fellow
will
serve
pilot
and
will
tell
what
and
whither
for
provisions
and
whither
not
for
fear
being
devoured
what
places
venture
into
and
what
shun
waked
with
this
thought
and
was
under
such
inexpressible
impressions
joy
the
prospect
escape
dream
that
the
disappointments
which
felt
upon
coming
myself
and
finding
that
was
more
than
dream
were
equally
extravagant
the
other
way
and
threw
into
very
great
dejection
spirits
upon
this
however
made
this
conclusion
that
only
way
about
attempt
escape
was
endeavour
get
savage
into
possession
and
possible
should
one
their
prisoners
whom
they
had
condemned
eaten
and
should
bring
hither
kill
but
these
thoughts
still
were
attended
with
this
difficulty
that
was
impossible
effect
this
without
attacking
whole
caravan
them
and
killing
them
all
and
this
was
not
only
very
desperate
attempt
and
might
miscarry
but
the
other
hand
had
greatly
scrupled
the
lawfulness
myself
and
heart
trembled
the
thoughts
shedding
much
blood
though
was
for
deliverance
need
not
repeat
the
arguments
which
occurred
against
this
they
being
the
same
mentioned
before
but
though
had
other
reasons
offer
now
viz
that
those
men
were
enemies
life
and
would
devour
they
could
that
was
self
preservation
the
highest
degree
deliver
myself
from
this
death
life
and
was
acting
own
defence
much
they
were
actually
assaulting
and
the
like
say
though
these
things
argued
for
yet
the
thoughts
shedding
human
blood
for
deliverance
were
very
terrible
and
such
could
means
reconcile
myself
for
great
while
however
last
after
many
secret
disputes
with
myself
and
after
great
perplexities
about
for
all
these
arguments
one
way
and
another
struggled
head
long
time
the
eager
prevailing
desire
deliverance
length
mastered
all
the
rest
and
resolved
possible
get
one
these
savages
into
hands
cost
what
would
next
thing
was
contrive
how
and
this
indeed
was
very
difficult
resolve
but
could
pitch
upon
probable
means
for
resolved
put
myself
upon
the
watch
see
them
when
they
came
shore
and
leave
the
rest
the
event
taking
such
measures
the
opportunity
should
present
let
what
would
with
these
resolutions
thoughts
set
myself
upon
the
scout
often
possible
and
indeed
often
that
was
heartily
tired
for
was
above
year
and
half
that
waited
and
for
great
part
that
time
went
out
the
west
end
and
the
south
west
corner
the
island
almost
every
day
look
for
canoes
but
none
appeared
this
was
very
discouraging
and
began
trouble
much
though
cannot
say
that
did
this
case
had
done
some
time
before
wear
off
the
edge
desire
the
thing
but
the
longer
seemed
delayed
the
more
eager
was
for
word
was
not
first
careful
shun
the
sight
these
savages
and
avoid
being
seen
them
was
now
eager
upon
them
besides
fancied
myself
able
manage
one
nay
two
three
savages
had
them
make
them
entirely
slaves
whatever
should
direct
them
and
prevent
their
being
able
any
time
any
hurt
was
great
while
that
pleased
myself
with
this
affair
but
nothing
still
presented
itself
all
fancies
and
schemes
came
nothing
for
savages
came
near
for
great
while
about
year
and
half
after
entertained
these
notions
and
long
musing
had
were
resolved
them
all
into
nothing
for
want
occasion
put
them
into
execution
was
surprised
one
morning
seeing
less
than
five
canoes
all
shore
together
side
the
island
and
the
people
who
belonged
them
all
landed
and
out
sight
the
number
them
broke
all
measures
for
seeing
many
and
knowing
that
they
always
came
four
six
sometimes
more
boat
could
not
tell
what
think
how
take
measures
attack
twenty
thirty
men
single
handed
lay
still
castle
perplexed
and
discomforted
however
put
myself
into
the
same
position
for
attack
that
had
formerly
provided
and
was
just
ready
for
action
anything
had
presented
having
waited
good
while
listening
hear
they
made
any
noise
length
being
very
impatient
set
guns
the
foot
ladder
and
clambered
the
top
the
hill
two
stages
usual
standing
however
that
head
did
not
appear
above
the
hill
that
they
could
not
perceive
any
means
here
observed
the
help
perspective
glass
that
they
were
less
than
thirty
number
that
they
had
fire
kindled
and
that
they
had
meat
dressed
how
they
had
cooked
knew
not
what
was
but
they
were
all
dancing
know
not
how
many
barbarous
gestures
and
figures
their
own
way
round
the
fire
while
was
thus
looking
them
perceived
perspective
two
miserable
wretches
dragged
from
the
boats
where
seems
they
were
laid
and
were
now
brought
out
for
the
slaughter
perceived
one
them
immediately
fall
being
knocked
down
suppose
with
club
wooden
sword
for
that
was
their
way
and
two
three
others
were
work
immediately
cutting
him
open
for
their
cookery
while
the
other
victim
was
left
standing
himself
till
they
should
ready
for
him
that
very
moment
this
poor
wretch
seeing
himself
little
liberty
and
unbound
nature
inspired
him
with
hopes
life
and
started
away
from
them
and
ran
with
incredible
swiftness
along
the
sands
directly
towards
mean
towards
that
part
the
coast
where
habitation
was
was
dreadfully
frightened
must
acknowledge
when
perceived
him
run
way
and
especially
when
thought
saw
him
pursued
the
whole
body
and
now
expected
that
part
dream
was
coming
pass
and
that
would
certainly
take
shelter
grove
but
could
not
depend
any
means
upon
dream
that
the
other
savages
would
not
pursue
him
thither
and
find
him
there
however
kept
station
and
spirits
began
recover
when
found
that
there
was
not
above
three
men
that
followed
him
and
still
more
was
encouraged
when
found
that
outstripped
them
exceedingly
running
and
gained
ground
them
that
could
but
hold
out
for
half
hour
saw
easily
would
fairly
get
away
from
them
all
there
was
between
them
and
castle
the
creek
which
mentioned
often
the
first
part
story
where
landed
cargoes
out
the
ship
and
this
saw
plainly
must
necessarily
swim
over
the
poor
wretch
would
taken
there
but
when
the
savage
escaping
came
thither
made
nothing
though
the
tide
was
then
but
plunging
swam
through
about
thirty
strokes
thereabouts
landed
and
ran
with
exceeding
strength
and
swiftness
when
the
three
persons
came
the
creek
found
that
two
them
could
swim
but
the
third
could
not
and
that
standing
the
other
side
looked
the
others
but
went
farther
and
soon
after
went
softly
back
again
which
happened
was
very
well
for
him
the
end
observed
that
the
two
who
swam
were
yet
more
than
twice
strong
swimming
over
the
creek
the
fellow
was
that
fled
from
them
came
very
warmly
upon
thoughts
and
indeed
irresistibly
that
now
was
the
time
get
servant
and
perhaps
companion
assistant
and
that
was
plainly
called
providence
save
this
poor
creature
life
immediately
ran
down
the
ladders
with
all
possible
expedition
fetched
two
guns
for
they
were
both
the
foot
the
ladders
observed
before
and
getting
again
with
the
same
haste
the
top
the
hill
crossed
towards
the
sea
and
having
very
short
cut
and
all
down
hill
placed
myself
the
way
between
the
pursuers
and
the
pursued
hallowing
aloud
him
that
fled
who
looking
back
was
first
perhaps
much
frightened
them
but
beckoned
with
hand
him
come
back
and
the
meantime
slowly
advanced
towards
the
two
that
followed
then
rushing
once
upon
the
foremost
knocked
him
down
with
the
stock
piece
was
loath
fire
because
would
not
have
the
rest
hear
though
that
distance
would
not
have
been
easily
heard
and
being
out
sight
the
smoke
too
they
would
not
have
known
what
make
having
knocked
this
fellow
down
the
other
who
pursued
him
stopped
had
been
frightened
and
advanced
towards
him
but
came
nearer
perceived
presently
had
bow
and
arrow
and
was
fitting
shoot
was
then
obliged
shoot
him
first
which
did
and
killed
him
the
first
shot
the
poor
savage
who
fled
but
had
stopped
though
saw
both
his
enemies
fallen
and
killed
thought
yet
was
frightened
with
the
fire
and
noise
piece
that
stood
stock
still
and
neither
came
forward
nor
went
backward
though
seemed
rather
inclined
still
fly
than
come
hallooed
again
him
and
made
signs
come
forward
which
easily
understood
and
came
little
way
then
stopped
again
and
then
little
farther
and
stopped
again
and
could
then
perceive
that
stood
trembling
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
had
just
been
killed
his
two
enemies
were
beckoned
him
again
come
and
gave
him
all
the
signs
encouragement
that
could
think
and
came
nearer
and
nearer
kneeling
down
every
ten
twelve
steps
token
acknowledgment
for
saving
his
life
smiled
him
and
looked
pleasantly
and
beckoned
him
come
still
nearer
length
came
close
and
then
kneeled
down
again
kissed
the
ground
and
laid
his
head
upon
the
ground
and
taking
the
foot
set
foot
upon
his
head
this
seems
was
token
swearing
slave
for
ever
took
him
and
made
much
him
and
encouraged
him
all
could
but
there
was
more
work
yet
for
perceived
the
savage
whom
had
knocked
down
was
not
killed
but
stunned
with
the
blow
and
began
come
himself
pointed
him
and
showed
him
the
savage
that
was
not
dead
upon
this
spoke
some
words
and
though
could
not
understand
them
yet
thought
they
were
pleasant
hear
for
they
were
the
first
sound
man
voice
that
had
heard
own
excepted
for
above
twenty
five
years
but
there
was
time
for
such
reflections
now
the
savage
who
was
knocked
down
recovered
himself
far
sit
upon
the
ground
and
perceived
that
savage
began
afraid
but
when
saw
that
presented
other
piece
the
man
would
shoot
him
upon
this
savage
for
call
him
now
made
motion
lend
him
sword
which
hung
naked
belt
side
which
did
sooner
had
but
runs
his
enemy
and
one
blow
cut
off
his
head
cleverly
executioner
germany
could
have
done
sooner
better
which
thought
very
strange
for
one
who
had
reason
believe
never
saw
sword
his
life
before
except
their
own
wooden
swords
however
seems
learned
afterwards
they
make
their
wooden
swords
sharp
heavy
and
the
wood
hard
that
they
will
even
cut
off
heads
with
them
and
arms
and
that
one
blow
too
when
had
done
this
comes
laughing
sign
triumph
and
brought
the
sword
again
and
with
abundance
gestures
which
did
not
understand
laid
down
with
the
head
the
savage
that
had
killed
just
before
but
that
which
astonished
him
most
was
know
how
killed
the
other
indian
far
off
pointing
him
made
signs
let
him
him
and
bade
him
well
could
when
came
him
stood
like
one
amazed
looking
him
turning
him
first
one
side
then
the
other
looked
the
wound
the
bullet
had
made
which
seems
was
just
his
breast
where
had
made
hole
and
great
quantity
blood
had
followed
but
had
bled
inwardly
for
was
quite
dead
took
his
bow
and
arrows
and
came
back
turned
away
and
beckoned
him
follow
making
signs
him
that
more
might
come
after
them
upon
this
made
signs
that
should
bury
them
with
sand
that
they
might
not
seen
the
rest
they
followed
and
made
signs
him
again
fell
work
and
instant
had
scraped
hole
the
sand
with
his
hands
big
enough
bury
the
first
and
then
dragged
him
into
and
covered
him
and
did
the
other
also
believe
had
him
buried
them
both
quarter
hour
then
calling
away
carried
him
not
castle
but
quite
away
cave
the
farther
part
the
island
did
not
let
dream
come
pass
that
part
that
came
into
grove
for
shelter
here
gave
him
bread
and
bunch
raisins
eat
and
draught
water
which
found
was
indeed
great
distress
for
from
his
running
and
having
refreshed
him
made
signs
for
him
and
lie
down
sleep
showing
him
place
where
had
laid
some
rice
straw
and
blanket
upon
which
used
sleep
upon
myself
sometimes
the
poor
creature
lay
down
and
went
sleep
was
comely
handsome
fellow
perfectly
well
made
with
straight
strong
limbs
not
too
large
tall
and
well
shaped
and
reckon
about
twenty
six
years
age
had
very
good
countenance
not
fierce
and
surly
aspect
but
seemed
have
something
very
manly
his
face
and
yet
had
all
the
sweetness
and
softness
european
his
countenance
too
especially
when
smiled
his
hair
was
long
and
black
not
curled
like
wool
his
forehead
very
high
and
large
and
great
vivacity
and
sparkling
sharpness
his
eyes
the
colour
his
skin
was
not
quite
black
but
very
tawny
and
yet
not
ugly
yellow
nauseous
tawny
the
brazilians
and
virginians
and
other
natives
america
are
but
bright
kind
dun
olive
colour
that
had
something
very
agreeable
though
not
very
easy
describe
his
face
was

when

upon
the
ground
with
all
the
possible
signs
humble
thankful
disposition
making
great
many
antic
gestures
show

lays
his
head
flat
upon
the
ground
close
foot
and
sets
other
foot
upon
his
head

done
before
and
after
this
made
all
the
signs
subjection
servitude
and
submission
imaginable

know
how
would
serve
long
lived

him
many
things
and
let
him
know
was
very
well
pleased
with
him
little
time
began
speak
him
and
teach
him
speak
and
first
let
him
know
his
name
should
friday
which
was
the
day
saved
his
life
called
him
for
the
memory
the
time
likewise
taught

and
then
let
him
know
that
was

and
know
the
meaning

some
milk

and
let
him

before
him
and
sop
bread
and
gave
him
cake

the
like
which
quickly
complied
with
and
made
signs
that
was
very
good
for
him
kept
there
with
him
all
that
night
but
soon
was
day
beckoned
him
come
with
and
let
him
know
would
give
him
some
clothes
which
seemed
very
glad
for
was
stark
naked
went
the
place
where
had
buried
the
two
men
pointed
exactly
the
place
and
showed
the
marks
that
had
made
find
them
again
making
signs
that
should
dig
them
again
and
eat
them
this
appeared
very
angry
expressed
abhorrence
made
would
vomit
the
thoughts
and
beckoned
with
hand
him
come
away
which
did
immediately
with
great
submission
then
led
him
the
top
the
hill
see
his
enemies
were
gone
and
pulling
out
glass
looked
and
saw
plainly
the
place
where
they
had
been
but
appearance
them
their
canoes
that
was
plain
they
were
gone
and
had
left
their
two
comrades
behind
them
without
any
search
after
them
but
was
not
content
with
this
discovery
but
having
now
more
courage
and
consequently
more
curiosity
took
man
friday
with
giving
him
the
sword
his
hand
with
the
bow
and
arrows
his
back
which
found
could
use
very
dexterously
making
him
carry
one
gun
for
and
two
for
myself
and
away
marched
the
place
where
these
creatures
had
been
for
had
mind
now
get
some
further
intelligence
them
when
came
the
place
very
blood
ran
chill
veins
and
heart
sunk
within
the
horror
the
spectacle
indeed
was
dreadful
sight
least
was
though
friday
made
nothing
the
place
was
covered
with
human
bones
the
ground
dyed
with
their
blood
and
great
pieces
flesh
left
here
and
there
half
eaten
mangled
and
scorched
and
short
all
the
tokens
the
triumphant
feast
they
had
been
making
there
after
victory
over
their
enemies
saw
three
skulls
five
hands
and
the
bones
three
four
legs
and
feet
and
abundance
other
parts
the
bodies
and
friday
his
signs
made
understand
that
they
brought
over
four
prisoners
feast
upon
that
three
them
were
eaten
and
that
pointing
himself
was
the
fourth
that
there
had
been
great
battle
between
them
and
their
next
king
whose
subjects
seems
had
been
one
and
that
they
had
taken
great
number
prisoners
all
which
were
carried
several
places
those
who
had
taken
them
the
fight
order
feast
upon
them
was
done
here
these
wretches
upon
those
they
brought
hither
caused
friday
gather
all
the
skulls
bones
flesh
and
whatever
remained
and
lay
them
together
heap
and
make
great
fire
upon
and
burn
them
all
ashes
found
friday
had
still
hankering
stomach
after
some
the
flesh
and
was
still
cannibal
his
nature
but
showed
much
abhorrence
the
very
thoughts
and
the
least
appearance
that
durst
not
discover
for
had
some
means
let
him
know
that
would
kill
him
offered
when
had
done
this
came
back
our
castle
and
there
fell
work
for
man
friday
and
first
all
gave
him
pair
linen
drawers
which
had
out
the
poor
gunner
chest
mentioned
which
found
the
wreck
and
which
with
little
alteration
fitted
him
very
well
and
then
made
him
jerkin
goat
skin
well
skill
would
allow
for
was
now
grown
tolerably
good
tailor
and
gave
him
cap
which
made
hare
skin
very
convenient
and
fashionable
enough
and
thus
was
clothed
for
the
present
tolerably
well
and
was
mighty
well
pleased
see
himself
almost
well
clothed
his
master
true
went
awkwardly
these
clothes
first
wearing
the
drawers
was
very
awkward
him
and
the
sleeves
the
waistcoat
galled
his
shoulders
and
the
inside
his
arms
but
little
easing
them
where
complained
they
hurt
him
and
using
himself
them
took
them
length
very
well
the
next
day
after
came
home
hutch
with
him
began
consider
where
should
lodge
him
and
that
might
well
for
him
and
yet
perfectly
easy
myself
made
little
tent
for
him
the
vacant
place
between
two
fortifications
the
inside
the
last
and
the
outside
the
first
there
was
door
entrance
there
into
cave
made
formal
framed
door
case
and
door
boards
and
set
the
passage
little
within
the
entrance
and
causing
the
door
open
the
inside
barred
the
night
taking
ladders
too
that
friday
could
way
come
the
inside
innermost
wall
without
making
much
noise
getting
over
that
must
needs
awaken
for
first
wall
had
now
complete
roof
over
long
poles
covering
all
tent
and
leaning
the
side
the
hill
which
was
again
laid
across
with
smaller
sticks
instead
laths
and
then
thatched
over
great
thickness
with
the
rice
straw
which
was
strong
like
reeds
and
the
hole
place
which
was
left
out
the
ladder
had
placed
kind
trap
door
which
had
been
attempted
the
outside
would
not
have
opened
all
but
would
have
fallen
down
and
made
great
noise
weapons
took
them
all
into
side
every
night
but
needed
none
all
this
precaution
for
never
man
had
more
faithful
loving
sincere
servant
than
friday
was
without
passions
sullenness
designs
perfectly
obliged
and
engaged
his
very
affections
were
tied
like
those
child
father
and
daresay
would
have
sacrificed
his
life
save
mine
upon
any
occasion
whatsoever
the
many
testimonies
gave
this
put
out
doubt
and
soon
convinced
that
needed
use
precautions
for
safety
his
account
this
frequently
gave
occasion
observe
and
that
with
wonder
that
however
had
pleased
god
his
providence
and
the
government
the
works
his
hands
take
from
great
part
the
world
his
creatures
the
best
uses
which
their
faculties
and
the
powers
their
souls
are
adapted
yet
that
has
bestowed
upon
them
the
same
powers
the
same
reason
the
same
affections
the
same
sentiments
kindness
and
obligation
the
same
passions
and
resentments
wrongs
the
same
sense
gratitude
sincerity
fidelity
and
all
the
capacities
doing
good
and
receiving
good
that
has
given
and
that
when
pleases
offer
them
occasions
exerting
these
they
are
ready
nay
more
ready
apply
them
the
right
uses
for
which
they
were
bestowed
than
are
this
made
very
melancholy
sometimes
reflecting
the
several
occasions
presented
how
mean
use
make
all
these
even
though
have
these
powers
enlightened
the
great
lamp
instruction
the
spirit
god
and
the
knowledge
his
word
added
our
understanding
and
why
has
pleased
god
hide
the
like
saving
knowledge
from
many
millions
souls
who
might
judge
this
poor
savage
would
make
much
better
use
than
did
from
hence
sometimes
was
led
too
far
invade
the
sovereignty
providence
and
were
arraign
the
justice
arbitrary
disposition
things
that
should
hide
that
sight
from
some
and
reveal
others
and
yet
expect
like
duty
from
both
but
shut
and
checked
thoughts
with
this
conclusion
first
that
did
not
know
what
light
and
law
these
should
condemned
but
that
god
was
necessarily
and
the
nature
his
being
infinitely
holy
and
just
could
not
but
these
creatures
were
all
sentenced
absence
from
himself
was
account
sinning
against
that
light
which
the
scripture
says
was
law
themselves
and
such
rules
their
consciences
would
acknowledge
just
though
the
foundation
was
not
discovered
and
secondly
that
still
all
are
the
clay
the
hand
the
potter
vessel
could
say
him
why
hast
thou
formed
thus
but
return
new
companion
was
greatly
delighted
with
him
and
made
business
teach
him
everything
that
was
proper
make
him
useful
handy
and
helpful
but
especially
make
him
speak
and
understand
when
spoke
and
was
the
aptest
scholar
that
ever
was
and
particularly
was
merry
constantly
diligent
and
pleased
when
could
but
understand
make
understand
him
that
was
very
pleasant
for
talk
him
now
life
began
easy
that
began
say
myself
that
could
but
have
been
safe
from
more
savages
cared
not
was
never
remove
from
the
place
where
lived
chapter
friday
education
after
had
been
two
three
days
returned
castle
thought
that
order
bring
friday
off
from
his
horrid
way
feeding
and
from
the
relish
cannibal
stomach
ought
let
him
taste
other
flesh
took
him
out
with
one
morning
the
woods
went
indeed
intending
kill
kid
out
own
flock
and
bring
home
and
dress
but
was
going
saw
she
goat
lying
down
the
shade
and
two
young
kids
sitting
her
catched
hold
friday
hold
said
stand
still
and
made
signs
him
not
stir
immediately
presented
piece
shot
and
killed
one
the
kids
the
poor
creature
who
had
distance
indeed
seen
kill
the
savage
his
enemy
but
did
not
know
nor
could
imagine
how
was
done
was
sensibly
surprised
trembled
and
shook
and
looked
amazed
that
thought
would
have
sunk
down
did
not
see
the
kid
shot
perceive
had
killed
but
ripped
his
waistcoat
feel
whether
was
not
wounded
and
found
presently
thought
was
resolved
kill
him
for
came
and
kneeled
down
and
embracing
knees
said
great
many
things
did
not
understand
but
could
easily
see
the
meaning
was
pray
not
kill
him
soon
found
way
convince
him
that
would
him
harm
and
taking
him
the
hand
laughed
him
and
pointing
the
kid
which
had
killed
beckoned
him
run
and
fetch
which
did
and
while
was
wondering
and
looking
see
how
the
creature
was
killed
loaded
gun
again
and
saw
great
fowl
like
hawk
sitting
upon
tree
within
shot
let
friday
understand
little
what
would
called
him
again
pointed
the
fowl
which
was
indeed
parrot
though
thought
had
been
hawk
say
pointing
the
parrot
and
gun
and
the
ground
under
the
parrot
let
him
see
would
make
fall
made
him
understand
that
would
shoot
and
kill
that
bird
accordingly
fired
and
bade
him
look
and
immediately
saw
the
parrot
fall
stood
like
one
frightened
again
notwithstanding
all
had
said
him
and
found
was
the
more
amazed
because
did
not
see
put
anything
into
the
gun
but
thought
that
there
must
some
wonderful
fund
death
and
destruction
that
thing
able
kill
man
beast
bird
anything
near
far
off
and
the
astonishment
this
created
him
was
such
could
not
wear
off
for
long
time
and
believe
would
have
let
him
would
have
worshipped
and
gun
for
the
gun
itself
would
not
much
touch
for
several
days
after
but
would
speak
and
talk
had
answered
him
when
was
himself
which
afterwards
learned
him
was
desire
not
kill
him
well
after
his
astonishment
was
little
over
this
pointed
him
run
and
fetch
the
bird
had
shot
which
did
but
stayed
some
time
for
the
parrot
not
being
quite
dead
had
fluttered
away
good
distance
from
the
place
where
she
fell
however
found
her
took
her
and
brought
her
and
had
perceived
his
ignorance
about
the
gun
before
took
this
advantage
charge
the
gun
again
and
not
let
him
see
that
might
ready
for
any
other
mark
that
might
present
but
nothing
more
offered
that
time
brought
home
the
kid
and
the
same
evening
took
the
skin
off
and
cut
out
well
could
and
having
pot
fit
for
that
purpose
boiled
stewed
some
the
flesh
and
made
some
very
good
broth
after
had
begun
eat
some
gave
some
man
who
seemed
very
glad
and
liked
very
well
but
that
which
was
strangest
him
was
see
eat
salt
with
made
sign
that
the
salt
was
not
good
eat
and
putting
little
into
his
own
mouth
seemed
nauseate
and
would
spit
and
sputter
washing
his
mouth
with
fresh
water
after
the
other
hand
took
some
meat
into
mouth
without
salt
and
pretended
spit
and
sputter
for
want
salt
much
had
done
the
salt
but
would
not
would
never
care
for
salt
with
meat
his
broth
least
not
for
great
while
and
then
but
very
little
having
thus
fed
him
with
boiled
meat
and
broth
was
resolved
feast
him
the
next
day
roasting
piece
the
kid
this
did
hanging
before
the
fire
string
had
seen
many
people
england
setting
two
poles
one
each
side
the
fire
and
one
across
the
top
and
tying
the
string
the
cross
stick
letting
the
meat
turn
continually
this
friday
admired
very
much
but
when
came
taste
the
flesh
took
many
ways
tell
how
well
liked
that
could
not
but
understand
him
and
last
told
well
could
would
never
eat
man
flesh
any
more
which
was
very
glad
hear
the
next
day
set
him
work
beating
some
corn
out
and
sifting
the
manner
used
observed
before
and
soon
understood
how
well
especially
after
had
seen
what
the
meaning
was
and
that
was
make
bread
for
after
that
let
him
see
make
bread
and
bake
too
and
little
time
friday
was
able
all
the
work
for
well
could
myself
began
now
consider
that
having
two
mouths
feed
instead
one
must
provide
more
ground
for
harvest
and
plant
larger
quantity
corn
than
used
marked
out
larger
piece
land
and
began
the
fence
the
same
manner
before
which
friday
worked
not
only
very
willingly
and
very
hard
but
did
very
cheerfully
and
told
him
what
was
for
that
was
for
corn
make
more
bread
because
was
now
with
and
that
might
have
enough
for
him
and
myself
too
appeared
very
sensible
that
part
and
let
know
that
thought
had
much
more
labour
upon
his
account
than
had
for
myself
and
that
would
work
the
harder
for
would
tell
him
what
this
was
the
pleasantest
year
all
the
life
led
this
place
friday
began
talk
pretty
well
and
understand
the
names
almost
everything
had
occasion
call
for
and
every
place
had
send
him
and
talked
great
deal
that
short
began
now
have
some
use
for
tongue
again
which
indeed
had
very
little
occasion
for
before
besides
the
pleasure
talking
him
had
singular
satisfaction
the
fellow
himself
his
simple
unfeigned
honesty
appeared
more
and
more
every
day
and
began
really
love
the
creature
and
his
side
believe
loved
more
than
was
possible
for
him
ever
love
anything
before
had
mind
once
try
had
any
inclination
for
his
own
country
again
and
having
taught
him
english
well
that
could
answer
almost
any
question
asked
him
whether
the
nation
that
belonged
never
conquered
battle
which
smiled
and
said
yes
yes
always
fight
the
better
that
meant
always
get
the
better
fight
and
began
the
following
discourse

being
the
same
formerly
mentioned
presently
knew
the
place
and
told
was
there
once
when
they
ate
twenty
men
two
women
and
one
child
could
not
tell
twenty
english
but
numbered
them
laying
many
stones
row
and
pointing
tell
them
over
have
told
this
passage
because
introduces
what
follows
that
after
this
discourse
had
with
him
asked
him
how
far
was
from
our
island
the
shore
and
whether
the
canoes
were
not
often
lost
told
there
was
danger
canoes
ever
lost
but
that
after
little
way
out
sea
there
was
current
and
wind
always
one
way
the
morning
the
other
the
afternoon
this
understood
more
than
the
sets
the
tide
going
out
coming
but
afterwards
understood
was
occasioned
the
great
draft
and
reflux
the
mighty
river
orinoco
the
mouth
gulf
which
river
found
afterwards
our
island
lay
and
that
this
land
which
perceived
and
was
the
great
island
trinidad
the
north
point
the
mouth
the
river
asked
friday
thousand
questions
about
the
country
the
inhabitants
the
sea
the
coast
and
what
nations
were
near
told
all
knew
with
the
greatest
openness
imaginable
asked
him
the
names
the
several
nations
his
sort
people
but
could
get
other
name
than
caribs
from
whence
easily
understood
that
these
were
the
caribbees
which
our
maps
place
the
part
america
which
reaches
from
the
mouth
the
river
orinoco
guiana
and
onwards
martha
told
that
great
way
beyond
the
moon
that
was
beyond
the
setting
the
moon
which
must
west
from
their
country
there
dwelt
white
bearded
men
like
and
pointed
great
whiskers
which
mentioned
before
and
that
they
had
killed
much
mans
that
was
his
word
all
which
understood
meant
the
spaniards
whose
cruelties
america
had
been
spread
over
the
whole
country
and
were
remembered
all
the
nations
from
father
son
inquired
could
tell
how
might
from
this
island
and
get
among
those
white
men
told
yes
yes
you
may
two
canoe
could
not
understand
what
meant
make
him
describe
what
meant
two
canoe
till
last
with
great
difficulty
found
meant
must
large
boat
big
two
canoes
this
part
friday
discourse
began
relish
very
well
and
from
this
time
entertained
some
hopes
that
one
time
other
might
find
opportunity
make
escape
from
this
place
and
that
this
poor
savage
might
means
help
during
the
long
time
that
friday
had
now
been
with
and
that
began
speak
and
understand
was
not
wanting
lay
foundation
religious
knowledge
his
mind
particularly
asked
him
one
time
who
made
him
the
creature
did
not
understand
all
but
thought
had
asked
who
was
his
father
but
took
another
handle
and
asked
him
who
made
the
sea
the
ground
walked
and
the
hills
and
woods
told
was
one
benamuckee
that
lived
beyond
all
could
describe
nothing
this
great
person
but
that
was
very
old
much
older
said
than
the
sea
land
than
the
moon
the
stars
asked
him
then
this
old
person
had
made
all
things
why
did
not
all
things
worship
him
looked
very
grave
and
with
perfect
look
innocence
said
all
things
say
him
asked
him
the
people
who
die
his
country
went
away
anywhere
said
yes
they
all
went
benamuckee
then
asked
him
whether
those
they
eat
went
thither
too
said
yes
from
these
things
began
instruct
him
the
knowledge
the
true
god
told
him
that
the
great
maker
all
things
lived
there
pointing
towards
heaven
that
governed
the
world
the
same
power
and
providence
which
made
that
was
omnipotent
and
could
everything
for
give
everything
take
everything
from
and
thus
degrees
opened
his
eyes
listened
with
great
attention
and
received
with
pleasure
the
notion
jesus
christ
being
sent
redeem
and
the
manner
making
our
prayers
god
and
his
being
able
hear
even
heaven
told
one
day
that
our
god
could
hear
beyond
the
sun
must
needs
greater
god
than
their
benamuckee
who
lived
but
little
way
off
and
yet
could
not
hear
till
they
went
the
great
mountains
where
dwelt
speak
them
asked
him
ever
went
thither
speak
him
said
they
never
went
that
were
young
men
none
went
thither
but
the
old
men
whom
called
their
oowokakee
that
made
him
explain
their
religious
clergy
and
that
they
went
say
called
saying
prayers
and
then
came
back
and
told
them
what
benamuckee
said
this
observed
that
there
priestcraft
even
among
the
most
blinded
ignorant
pagans
the
world
and
the
policy
making
secret
religion
order
preserve
the
veneration
the
people
the
clergy
not
only
found
the
roman
but
perhaps
among
all
religions
the
world
even
among
the
most
brutish
and
barbarous
savages
endeavoured
clear
this
fraud
man
friday
and
told
him
that
the
pretence
their
old
men
going
the
mountains
say
their
god
benamuckee
was
cheat
and
their
bringing
word
from
thence
what
said
was
much
more
that
they
met
with
any
answer
spake
with
any
one
there
must
with
evil
spirit
and
then
entered
into
long
discourse
with
him
about
the
devil
the
origin
him
his
rebellion
against
god
his
enmity
man
the
reason
his
setting
himself
the
dark
parts
the
world
worshipped
instead
god
and
god
and
the
many
stratagems
made
use
delude
mankind
their
ruin
how
had
secret
access
our
passions
and
our
affections
and
adapt
his
snares
our
inclinations
cause
even
our
own
tempters
and
run
upon
our
destruction
our
own
choice
found
was
not
easy
imprint
right
notions
his
mind
about
the
devil
was
about
the
being
god
nature
assisted
all
arguments
evidence
him
even
the
necessity
great
first
cause
overruling
governing
power
secret
directing
providence
and
the
equity
and
justice
paying
homage
him
that
made
and
the
like
but
there
appeared
nothing
this
kind
the
notion
evil
spirit
his
origin
his
being
his
nature
and
above
all
his
inclination
evil
and
draw
too
and
the
poor
creature
puzzled
once
such
manner
question
merely
natural
and
innocent
that
scarce
knew
what
say
him
had
been
talking
great
deal
him
the
power
god
his
omnipotence
his
aversion
sin
his
being
consuming
fire
the
workers
iniquity
how
had
made
all
could
destroy
and
all
the
world
moment
and
listened
with
great
seriousness
all
the
while
after
this
had
been
telling
him
how
the
devil
was
god
enemy
the
hearts
men
and
used
all
his
malice
and
skill
defeat
the
good
designs
providence
and
ruin
the
kingdom
christ
the
world
and
the
like
well
says
friday
but
you
say
god
strong
great
not
much
strong
much
might
the
devil
yes
yes
says
friday
god
stronger
than
the
devil
god
above
the
devil
and
therefore
pray
god
tread
him
down
under
our
feet
and
enable
resist
his
temptations
and
quench
his
fiery
darts
but
says
again
god
much
stronger
much
might
the
wicked
devil
why
god
kill
the
devil
make
him
more
wicked
was
strangely
surprised
this
question
and
after
all
though
was
now
old
man
yet
was
but
young
doctor
and
ill
qualified
for
casuist
solver
difficulties
and
first
could
not
tell
what
say
pretended
not
hear
him
and
asked
him
what
said
but
was
too
earnest
for
answer
forget
his
question
that
repeated
the
very
same
broken
words
above
this
time
had
recovered
myself
little
and
said
god
will
last
punish
him
severely
reserved
for
the
judgment
and
cast
into
the
bottomless
pit
dwell
with
everlasting
fire
this
did
not
satisfy
friday
but
returns
upon
repeating
words
reserve
last
understand
but
why
not
kill
the
devil
now
not
kill
great
ago
you
may
well
ask
said
why
god
does
not
kill
you
when
wicked
things
here
that
offend
him
are
preserved
repent
and
pardoned
mused
some
time
this
well
well
says
mighty
affectionately
that
well
you
devil
all
wicked
all
preserve
repent
god
pardon
all
here
was
run
down
again
him
the
last
degree
and
was
testimony
how
the
mere
notions
nature
though
they
will
guide
reasonable
creatures
the
knowledge
god
and
worship
homage
due
the
supreme
being
god
the
consequence
our
nature
yet
nothing
but
divine
revelation
can
form
the
knowledge
jesus
christ
and
redemption
purchased
for
mediator
the
new
covenant
and
intercessor
the
footstool
god
throne
say
nothing
but
revelation
from
heaven
can
form
these
the
soul
and
that
therefore
the
gospel
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
mean
the
word
god
and
the
spirit
god
promised
for
the
guide
and
sanctifier
his
people
are
the
absolutely
necessary
instructors
the
souls
men
the
saving
knowledge
god
and
the
means
salvation
therefore
diverted
the
present
discourse
between
and
man
rising
hastily
upon
some
sudden
occasion
going
out
then
sending
him
for
something
good
way
off
seriously
prayed
god
that
would
enable
instruct
savingly
this
poor
savage
assisting
his
spirit
the
heart
the
poor
ignorant
creature
receive
the
light
the
knowledge
god
christ
reconciling
him
himself
and
would
guide
speak
him
from
the
word
god
that
his
conscience
might
convinced
his
eyes
opened
and
his
soul
saved
when
came
again
entered
into
long
discourse
with
him
upon
the
subject
the
redemption
man
the
saviour
the
world
and
the
doctrine
the
gospel
preached
from
heaven
viz
repentance
towards
god
and
faith
our
blessed
lord
jesus
then
explained
him
well
could
why
our
blessed
redeemer
took
not
him
the
nature
angels
but
the
seed
abraham
and
how
for
that
reason
the
fallen
angels
had
share
the
redemption
that
came
only
the
lost
sheep
the
house
israel
and
the
like
had
god
knows
more
sincerity
than
knowledge
all
the
methods
took
for
this
poor
creature
instruction
and
must
acknowledge
what
believe
all
that
act
upon
the
same
principle
will
find
that
laying
things
open
him
really
informed
and
instructed
myself
many
things
that
either
did
not
know
had
not
fully
considered
before
but
which
occurred
naturally
mind
upon
searching
into
them
for
the
information
this
poor
savage
and
had
more
affection
inquiry
after
things
upon
this
occasion
than
ever
felt
before
that
whether
this
poor
wild
wretch
was
better
for
had
great
reason
thankful
that
ever
came
grief
sat
lighter
upon
habitation
grew
comfortable
beyond
measure
and
when
reflected
that
this
solitary
life
which
have
been
confined
had
not
only
been
moved
look
heaven
myself
and
seek
the
hand
that
had
brought
here
but
was
now
made
instrument
under
providence
save
the
life
and
for
aught
knew
the
soul
poor
savage
and
bring
him
the
true
knowledge
religion
and
the
christian
doctrine
that
might
know
christ
jesus
whom
life
eternal
say
when
reflected
upon
all
these
things
secret
joy
ran
through
every
part
soul
and
frequently
rejoiced
that
ever
was
brought
this
place
which
had
often
thought
the
most
dreadful
all
afflictions
that
could
possibly
have
befallen
continued
this
thankful
frame
all
the
remainder
time
and
the
conversation
which
employed
the
hours
between
friday
and
was
such
made
the
three
years
which
lived
there
together
perfectly
and
completely
happy
any
such
thing
complete
happiness
can
formed
sublunary
state
this
savage
was
now
good
christian
much
better
than
though
have
reason
hope
and
bless
god
for
that
were
equally
penitent
and
comforted
restored
penitents
had
here
the
word
god
read
and
farther
off
from
his
spirit
instruct
than
had
been
england
always
applied
myself
reading
the
scripture
let
him
know
well
could
the
meaning
what
read
and
again
his
serious
inquiries
and
questionings
made
said
before
much
better
scholar
the
scripture
knowledge
than
should
ever
have
been
own
mere
private
reading
another
thing
cannot
refrain
from
observing
here
also
from
experience
this
retired
part
life
viz
how
infinite
and
inexpressible
blessing
that
the
knowledge
god
and
the
doctrine
salvation
christ
jesus
plainly
laid
down
the
word
god
easy
received
and
understood
that
the
bare
reading
the
scripture
made
capable
understanding
enough
duty
carry
directly
the
great
work
sincere
repentance
for
sins
and
laying
hold
saviour
for
life
and
salvation
stated
reformation
practice
and
obedience
all
god
commands
and
this
without
any
teacher
instructor
mean
human
the
same
plain
instruction
sufficiently
served
the
enlightening
this
savage
creature
and
bringing
him
such
christian
have
known
few
equal
him
life
all
the
disputes
wrangling
strife
and
contention
which
have
happened
the
world
about
religion
whether
niceties
doctrines
schemes
church
government
they
were
all
perfectly
useless
and
for
aught
can
yet
see
they
have
been
the
rest
the
world
had
the
sure
guide
heaven
viz
the
word
god
and
had
blessed
god
comfortable
views
the
spirit
god
teaching
and
instructing
his
word
leading
into
all
truth
and
making
both
willing
and
obedient
the
instruction
his
word
and
cannot
see
the
least
use
that
the
greatest
knowledge
the
disputed
points
religion
which
have
made
such
confusion
the
world
would
have
been
could
have
obtained
but
must
with
the
historical
part
things
and
take
every
part
its
order
after
friday
and
became
more
intimately
acquainted
and
that
could
understand
almost
all
said
him
and
speak
pretty
fluently
though
broken
english
acquainted
him
with
own
history
least
much
related
coming
this
place
how
had
lived
there
and
how
long
let
him
into
the
mystery
for
such
was
him
gunpowder
and
bullet
and
taught
him
how
shoot
gave
him
knife
which
was
wonderfully
delighted
with
and
made
him
belt
with
frog
hanging
such
england
wear
hangers
and
the
frog
instead
hanger
gave
him
hatchet
which
was
not
only
good
weapon
some
cases
but
much
more
useful
upon
other
occasions
described
him
the
country
europe
particularly
england
which
came
from
how
lived
how
worshipped
god
how
behaved
one
another
and
how
traded
ships
all
parts
the
world
gave
him
account
the
wreck
which
had
been
board
and
showed
him
near
could
the
place
where
she
lay
but
she
was
all
beaten
pieces
before
and
gone
showed
him
the
ruins
our
boat
which
lost
when
escaped
and
which
could
not
stir
with
whole
strength
then
but
was
now
fallen
almost
all
pieces
upon
seeing
this
boat
friday
stood
musing
great
while
and
said
nothing
asked
him
what
was
studied
upon
last
says
see
such
boat
like
come
place
nation
did
not
understand
him
good
while
but
last
when
had
examined
further
into
understood
him
that
boat
such
that
had
been
came
shore
upon
the
country
where
lived
that
explained
was
driven
thither
stress
weather
presently
imagined
that
some
european
ship
must
have
been
cast
away
upon
their
coast
and
the
boat
might
get
loose
and
drive
ashore
but
was
dull
that
never
once
thought
men
making
their
escape
from
wreck
thither
much
less
whence
they
might
come
only
inquired
after
description
the
boat
friday
described
the
boat
well
enough
but
brought
better
understand
him
when
added
with
some
warmth
save
the
white
mans
from
drown
then
presently
asked
there
were
any
white
mans
called
them
the
boat
yes
said
the
boat
full
white
mans
asked
him
how
many
told
upon
his
fingers
seventeen
asked
him
then
what
became
them
told
they
live
they
dwell
nation
this
put
new
thoughts
into
head
for
presently
imagined
that
these
might
the
men
belonging
the
ship
that
was
cast
away
the
sight
island
now
called
and
who
after
the
ship
was
struck
the
rock
and
they
saw
her
inevitably
lost
had
saved
themselves
their
boat
and
were
landed
upon
that
wild
shore
among
the
savages
upon
this
inquired
him
more
critically
what
was
become
them
assured
they
lived
still
there
that
they
had
been
there
about
four
years
that
the
savages
left
them
alone
and
gave
them
victuals
live
asked
him
how
came
pass
they
did
not
kill
them
and
eat
them
said
they
make
brother
with
them
that
understood
him
truce
and
then
added
they
eat
mans
but
when
make
the
war
fight
that
say
they
never
eat
any
men
but
such
come
fight
with
them
and
are
taken
battle
was
after
this
some
considerable
time
that
being
upon
the
top
the
hill
the
east
side
the
island
from
whence
have
said
had
clear
day
discovered
the
main
continent
america
friday
the
weather
being
very
serene
looks
very
earnestly
towards
the
mainland
and
kind
surprise
falls
jumping
and
dancing
and
calls
out
for
was
some
distance
from
him
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
joy
says
glad
there
see
country
there
nation
observed
extraordinary
sense
pleasure
appeared
his
face
and
his
eyes
sparkled
and
his
countenance
discovered
strange
eagerness
had
mind
his
own
country
again
this
observation
mine
put
great
many
thoughts
into
which
made
first
not
easy
about
new
man
friday
was
before
and
made
doubt
but
that
friday
could
get
back
his
own
nation
again
would
not
only
forget
all
his
religion
but
all
his
obligation
and
would
forward
enough
give
his
countrymen
account
and
come
back
perhaps
with
hundred
two
them
and
make
feast
upon
which
might
merry
used
with
those
his
enemies
when
they
were
taken
war
but
wronged
the
poor
honest
creature
very
much
for
which
was
very
sorry
afterwards
however
jealousy
increased
and
held
some
weeks
was
little
more
circumspect
and
not
familiar
and
kind
him
before
which
was
certainly
wrong
too
the
honest
grateful
creature
having
thought
about
but
what
consisted
with
the
best
principles
both
religious
christian
and
grateful
friend
appeared
afterwards
full
satisfaction
while
jealousy
him
lasted
you
may
sure
was
every
day
pumping
him
see
would
discover
any
the
new
thoughts
which
suspected
were
him
but
found
everything
said
was
honest
and
innocent
that
could
find
nothing
nourish
suspicion
and
spite
all
uneasiness
made
last
entirely
his
own
again
nor
did
the
least
perceive
that
was
uneasy
and
therefore
could
not
suspect
him
deceit
one
day
walking
the
same
hill
but
the
weather
being
hazy
sea
that
could
not
see
the
continent
called
him
and
said
friday

swift
again
could
when
was
said
him
well
now
friday

looked
very
dull
saying
which
seems
was
because
thought

boat
was
too
small
far
then
told
him

bigger
the
next
day
went
the
place
where
the
first
boat
lay
which
had
made
but
which
could
not
get
into
the
water
said
that
was
big
enough
but
then
had
taken
care
and
had
lain
two
three
and
twenty
years
there
the
sun
had
split
and
dried
that
was
rotten
friday

this
was
his
way

fixed
upon
design
going
over
with

the
continent
that
told
him
would
and
make
one
big
that
and
should

answered
not
one
word
but
looked
very
grave
and
sad
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
with
him
asked
again
why
you
angry
mad
with
friday
what

asked
him
what

before
looked
confused
again
that
word
and
running
one
the
hatchets
which
used
wear
takes
hastily
and
gives
what
must
with
this
says
him

said
again
returns
very
quick
what
you
send

away
for
take

friday

friday
away
this
spoke
earnestly
that
saw
tears
stand
his
eyes
word
plainly
discovered
the
utmost
affection
him
and
firm
resolution
him
that
told
him
then
and
often
after
that
would
never
send
him
away
from
was
willing
stay
with
upon
the
whole
found
all
his
discourse
settled
affection
and
that
nothing
could
part
him
from
found
all
the
foundation
his
desire
his
own
country
was
laid
his
ardent
affection
the
people
and
his
hopes
doing
them
good
thing
which
had
notion
myself
had
not
the
least
thought
intention
desire
undertaking
but
still
found
strong
inclination
attempting
escape
founded
the
supposition
gathered
from
the
discourse
that
there
were
seventeen
bearded
men
there
and
therefore
without
any
more
delay
went
work
with
friday
find
out
great
tree
proper
fell
and
make
large
periagua
canoe
undertake
the
voyage
there
were
trees
enough
the
island
have
built
little
fleet
not
periaguas
canoes
but
even
good
large
vessels
but
the
main
thing
looked
was
get
one
near
the
water
that
might
launch
when
was
made
avoid
the
mistake
committed
first
last
friday
pitched
upon
tree
for
found
knew
much
better
than
what
kind
wood
was
fittest
for
nor
can
tell
this
day
what
wood
call
the
tree
cut
down
except
that
was
very
like
the
tree
call
fustic
between
that
and
the
nicaragua
wood
for
was
much
the
same
colour
and
smell
friday
wished
burn
the
hollow
cavity
this
tree
out
make
for
boat
but
showed
him
how
cut
with
tools
which
after
had
showed
him
how
use
did
very
handily
and
about
month
hard
labour
finished
and
made
very
handsome
especially
when
with
our
axes
which
showed
him
how
handle
cut
and
hewed
the
outside
into
the
true
shape
boat
after
this
however
cost
near
fortnight
time
get
her
along
were
inch
inch
upon
great
rollers
into
the
water
but
when
she
was
she
would
have
carried
twenty
men
with
great
ease
when
she
was
the
water
though
she
was
big
amazed
see
with
what
dexterity
and
how
swift
man
friday
could
manage
her
turn
her
and
paddle
her
along
asked
him
would
and
might
venture
over
her
yes
said
venture
over
her
very
well
though
great
blow
wind
however
had
further
design
that
knew
nothing
and
that
was
make
mast
and
sail
and
fit
her
with
anchor
and
cable
mast
that
was
easy
enough
get
pitched
upon
straight
young
cedar
tree
which
found
near
the
place
and
which
there
were
great
plenty
the
island
and
set
friday
work
cut
down
and
gave
him
directions
how
shape
and
order
but
the
sail
that
was
particular
care
knew
had
old
sails
rather
pieces
old
sails
enough
but
had
had
them
now
six
and
twenty
years
and
had
not
been
very
careful
preserve
them
not
imagining
that
should
ever
have
this
kind
use
for
them
did
not
doubt
but
they
were
all
rotten
and
indeed
most
them
were
however
found
two
pieces
which
appeared
pretty
good
and
with
these
went
work
and
with
great
deal
pains
and
awkward
stitching
you
may
sure
for
want
needles
length
made
three
cornered
ugly
thing
like
what
call
england
shoulder
mutton
sail
with
boom
bottom
and
little
short
sprit
the
top
such
usually
our
ships
long
boats
sail
with
and
such
best
knew
how
manage
was
such
one
had
the
boat
which
made
escape
from
barbary
related
the
first
part
story
was
near
two
months
performing
this
last
work
viz
rigging
and
fitting
masts
and
sails
for
finished
them
very
complete
making
small
stay
and
sail
foresail
assist
should
turn
windward
and
what
was
more
than
all
fixed
rudder
the
stern
her
steer
with
was
but
bungling
shipwright
yet
knew
the
usefulness
and
even
necessity
such
thing
applied
myself
with
much
pains
that
last
brought
pass
though
considering
the
many
dull
contrivances
had
for
that
failed
think
cost
almost
much
labour
making
the
boat
after
all
this
was
done
had
man
friday
teach
what
belonged
the
navigation
boat
though
knew
very
well
how
paddle
canoe
knew
nothing
what
belonged
sail
and
rudder
and
was
the
most
amazed
when
saw
work
the
boat
and
again
the
sea
the
rudder
and
how
the
sail
jibed
and
filled
this
way
that
way
the
course
sailed
changed
say
when
saw
this
stood
like
one
astonished
and
amazed
however
with
little
use
made
all
these
things
familiar
him
and
became
expert
sailor
except
that
the
compass
could
make
him
understand
very
little
the
other
hand
there
was
very
little
cloudy
weather
and
seldom
never
any
fogs
those
parts
there
was
the
less
occasion
for
compass
seeing
the
stars
were
always
seen
night
and
the
shore
day
except
the
rainy
seasons
and
then
nobody
cared
stir
abroad
either
land
sea
was
now
entered
the
seven
and
twentieth
year
captivity
this
place
though
the
three
last
years
that
had
this
creature
with
ought
rather
left
out
the
account
habitation
being
quite
another
kind
than
all
the
rest
the
time
kept
the
anniversary
landing
here
with
the
same
thankfulness
god
for
his
mercies
first
and
had
such
cause
acknowledgment
first
had
much
more
now
having
such
additional
testimonies
the
care
providence
over
and
the
great
hopes
had
being
effectually
and
speedily
delivered
for
had
invincible
impression
upon
thoughts
that
deliverance
was
hand
and
that
should
not
another
year
this
place
went
however
with
husbandry
digging
planting
and
fencing
usual
gathered
and
cured
grapes
and
did
every
necessary
thing
before
the
rainy

was
the
meantime
upon
when
kept
more
within
doors
than
other
times
had
stowed
our
new
vessel

said
the
beginning

and
hauling

little
dock
just
big
enough
hold
her
and
just
deep
enough
give
her
water
enough
float
and
then
when
the
tide
was
out
made
strong
dam
across
the
end
keep
the
water
out
and
she
lay
dry
the
tide
from
the
sea
and
keep
the
rain
off
laid
great
many
boughs
trees
thick
that
she
was
well
thatched
house
and
thus
waited
for
the
months
november
and
december
which
designed
make
adventure
when
the
settled
season
began
come
the
thought
design
returned
with
the
fair
weather

preparing
daily
for
the
voyage
and
the
first
thing

the
sake

friday
had
not
been
long
gone
when
came
running
back
and
flew
over
outer
wall
fence
like
one
that
felt
not
the
ground
the
steps
set
his
foot
and
before
had
time
speak
him
cries
out
master

matter
friday
says
yonder
there
says
one
two

this
way
speaking
concluded
there
were
six
but
inquiry
found
there
were
but
three
well
friday
says
not
frightened
heartened
him
well
could
however
saw
the
poor
fellow
was
most
terribly
scared
for
nothing
ran
his
head
but
that
they
were
come
look
for
him
and
would
cut
him
pieces
and
eat
him
and
the
poor
fellow
trembled
that
scarcely
knew
what
with
him
comforted
him
well
could
and
told
him
was
much
danger
and
that
they
would
eat
well
him
but
says
friday
must
resolve
fight
them
can
you
fight
friday
shoot
says
but
there
come
many
great
number
matter
for
that
said
again
our
guns
will
fright
them
that
not
kill
asked
him
whether
resolved
defend
him
would
defend
and
stand
and
just
bid
him
said
die
when
you
bid
die
master
went
and
fetched
good
dram
rum
and
gave
him
for
had
been
good
husband
rum
that
had
great
deal
left
when
had
drunk
made
him
take
the
two
fowling
pieces
which
always
carried
and
loaded
them
with
large
swan
shot
big
small
pistol
bullets
then
took
four
muskets
and
loaded
them
with
two
slugs
and
five
small
bullets
each
and
two
pistols
loaded
with
brace
bullets
each
hung
great
sword
usual
naked
side
and
gave
friday
his
hatchet
when
had
thus
prepared
myself
took
perspective
glass
and
went
the
side
the
hill
see
what
could
discover
and
found
quickly
glass
that
there
were
one
and
twenty
savages
three
prisoners
and
three
canoes
and
that
their
whole
business
seemed
the
triumphant
banquet
upon
these
three
human
bodies
barbarous
feast
indeed
but
nothing
more
than
had
observed
was
usual
with
them
observed
also
that
they
had
landed
not
where
they
had
done
when
friday
made
his
escape
but
nearer
creek
where
the
shore
was
low
and
where
thick
wood
came
almost
close
down
the
sea
this
with
the
abhorrence
the
inhuman
errand
these
wretches
came
about
filled
with
such
indignation
that
came
down
again
friday
and
told
him
was
resolved
down
them
and
kill
them
all
and
asked
him
would
stand
had
now
got
over
his
fright
and
his
spirits
being
little
raised
with
the
dram
had
given
him
was
very
cheerful
and
told
before
would
die
when
bid
die
this
fit
fury
divided
the
arms
which
had
charged
before
between
gave
friday
one
pistol
stick
his
girdle
and
three
guns
upon
his
shoulder
and
took
one
pistol
and
the
other
three
guns
myself
and
this
posture
marched
out
took
small
bottle
rum
pocket
and
gave
friday
large
bag
with
more
powder
and
bullets
and
orders
charged
him
keep
close
behind
and
not
stir
shoot
anything
till
bid
him
and
the
meantime
not
speak
word
this
posture
fetched
compass
right
hand
near
mile
well
get
over
the
creek
get
into
the
wood
that
could
come
within
shot
them
before
should
discovered
which
had
seen
glass
was
easy
while
was
making
this
march
former
thoughts
returning
began
abate
resolution
not
mean
that
entertained
any
fear
their
number
for
they
were
naked
unarmed
wretches
certain
was
superior
them
nay
though
had
been
alone
but
occurred
thoughts
what
call
what
occasion
much
less
what
necessity
was
and
dip
hands
blood
attack
people
who
had
neither
done
intended
any
wrong
who
were
innocent
and
whose
barbarous
customs
were
their
own
disaster
being
them
token
indeed
god
having
left
them
with
the
other
nations
that
part
the
world
such
stupidity
and
such
inhuman
courses
but
did
not
call
take
upon
judge
their
actions
much
less
executioner
his
justice
that
whenever
thought
fit
would
take
the
cause
into
his
own
hands
and
national
vengeance
punish
them
people
for
national
crimes
but
that
the
meantime
was
none
business
that
was
true
friday
might
justify
because
was
declared
enemy
and
state
war
with
those
very
particular
people
and
was
lawful
for
him
attack
them
but
could
not
say
the
same
with
regard
myself
these
things
were
warmly
pressed
upon
thoughts
all
the
way
went
that
resolved
would
only
and
place
myself
near
them
that
might
observe
their
barbarous
feast
and
that
would
act
then
god
should
direct
but
that
unless
something
offered
that
was
more
call
than
yet
knew
would
not
meddle
with
them
with
this
resolution
entered
the
wood
and
with
all
possible
wariness
and
silence
friday
following
close
heels
marched
till
came
the
skirts
the
wood
the
side
which
was
next
them
only
that
one
corner
the
wood
lay
between
and
them
here
called
softly
friday
and
showing
him
great
tree
which
was
just
the
corner
the
wood
bade
him
the
tree
and
bring
word
could
see
there
plainly
what
they
were
doing
did
and
came
immediately
back
and
told
they
might
plainly
viewed
there
that
they
were
all
about
their
fire
eating
the
flesh
one
their
prisoners
and
that
another
lay
bound
upon
the
sand
little
from
them
whom
said
they
would
kill
next
and
this
fired
the
very
soul
within
told
was
not
one
their
nation
but
one
the
bearded
men
had
told
that
came
their
country
the
boat
was
filled
with
horror
the
very
naming
the
white
bearded
man
and
going
the
tree
saw
plainly
glass
white
man
who
lay
upon
the
beach
the
sea
with
his
hands
and
his
feet
tied
with
flags
things
like
rushes
and
that
was
european
and
had
clothes
there
was
another
tree
and
little
thicket
beyond
about
fifty
yards
nearer
them
than
the
place
where
was
which
going
little
way
about
saw
might
come
undiscovered
and
that
then
should
within
half
shot
them
withheld
passion
though
was
indeed
enraged
the
highest
degree
and
going
back
about
twenty
paces
got
behind
some
bushes
which
held
all
the
way
till
came
the
other
tree
and
then
came
little
rising
ground
which
gave
full
view
them
the
distance
about
eighty
yards
had
now
not
moment
lose
for
nineteen
the
dreadful
wretches
sat
upon
the
ground
all
close
huddled
together
and
had
just
sent
the
other
two
butcher
the
poor
christian
and
bring
him
perhaps
limb
limb
their
fire
and
they
were
stooping
down
untie
the
bands
his
feet
turned
friday
now
friday
said
bid
thee

said
would
then
friday
says
exactly

set
down
one
the
muskets
and
the
fowling
piece
upon
the
ground
and
friday
did
the
like
his
and
with
the
other
musket
took
aim
the
savages
bidding
him
the
like
then
asking
him
was
ready
said
yes
then
fire
them
said
and
the
same
moment
fired
also
friday
took
his
aim
much
better
than
that
the
side
that
shot
killed
two
them
and
wounded
three
more
and
side
killed
one
and
wounded
two
they
were
you
may
sure
dreadful
consternation
and
all
them
that
were
not
hurt
jumped
upon
their
feet
but
did
not
immediately
know
which
way
run
which
way
look
for
they
knew
not
from
whence
their
destruction
came
friday
kept
his
eyes
close
upon
that
had
bid
him
might
observe
what
did
soon
the
first
shot
was
made
threw
down
the
piece
and
took
the
fowling
piece
and
friday
did
the
like
saw
cock
and
present
did
the
same
again
are
you
ready
friday
said
yes
says
let
fly
then
says
the
name
god
and
with
that
fired
again
among
the
amazed
wretches
and
did
friday
and
our
pieces
were
now
loaded
with
what
call
swan
shot
small
pistol
bullets
found
only
two
drop
but
many
were
wounded
that
they
ran
about
yelling
and
screaming
like
mad
creatures
all
bloody
and
most
them
miserably
wounded
whereof
three
more
fell
quickly
after
though
not
quite
dead
now
friday

laying
down
the
discharged
pieces
and
taking
the
musket
which
was
yet
loaded
follow
which
did
with
great
deal
courage
upon
which
rushed
out
the
wood
and
showed
myself
and
friday
close
foot
soon
perceived
they
saw
shouted
loud
could
and
bade
friday
too
and
running
fast
could
which
the
way
was
not
very
fast
being
loaded
with
arms
was
made
directly
towards
the
poor
victim
who
was
said
lying
upon
the
beach
shore
between
the
place
where
they
sat
and
the
sea
the
two
butchers
who
were
just
going
work
with
him
had
left
him
the
surprise
our
first
fire
and
fled
terrible
fright
the
seaside
and
had
jumped
into
canoe
and
three
more
the
rest
made
the
same
way
turned
friday
and
bade
him
step
forwards
and
fire
them
understood
immediately
and
running
about
forty
yards
nearer
them
shot
them
and
thought
had
killed
them
all
for
saw
them
all
fall
heap
into
the
boat
though
saw
two
them
again
quickly
however
killed
two
them
and
wounded
the
third
that
lay
down
the
bottom
the
boat
had
been
dead
while
man
friday
fired
them
pulled
out
knife
and
cut
the
flags
that
bound
the
poor
victim
and
loosing
his
hands
and
feet
lifted
him
and
asked
him
the
portuguese
tongue
what
was
answered
latin
christianus
but
was
weak
and
faint
that
could
scarce
stand
speak
took
bottle
out
pocket
and
gave
him
making
signs
that
should
drink
which
did
and
gave
him
piece
bread
which
ate
then
asked
him
what
countryman
was
and
said
espagniole
and
being
little
recovered
let
know
all
the
signs
could
possibly
make
how
much
was
debt
for
his
deliverance
seignior
said
with
much
spanish
could
make
will
talk
afterwards
but
must
fight
now
you
have
any
strength
left
take
this
pistol
and
sword
and
lay
about
you
took
them
very
thankfully
and
sooner
had
the
arms
his
hands
but
they
had
put
new
vigour
into
him
flew
upon
his
murderers
like
fury
and
had
cut
two
them
pieces
instant
for
the
truth
the
whole
was
surprise
them
the
poor
creatures
were
much
frightened
with
the
noise
our
pieces
that
they
fell
down
for
mere
amazement
and
fear
and
had
more
power
attempt
their
own
escape
than
their
flesh
had
resist
our
shot
and
that
was
the
case
those
five
that
friday
shot
the
boat
for
three
them
fell
with
the
hurt
they
received
the
other
two
fell
with
the
fright
kept
piece
hand
still
without
firing
being
willing
keep
charge
ready
because
had
given
the
spaniard
pistol
and
sword
called
friday
and
bade
him
run
the
tree
from
whence
first
fired
and
fetch
the
arms
which
lay
there
that
had
been
discharged
which
did
with
great
swiftness
and
then
giving
him
musket
sat
down
myself
load
all
the
rest
again
and
bade
them
come
when
they
wanted
while
was
loading
these
pieces
there
happened
fierce
engagement
between
the
spaniard
and
one
the
savages
who
made
him
with
one
their
great
wooden
swords
the
weapon
that
was
have
killed
him
before
had
not
prevented
the
spaniard
who
was
bold
and
brave
could
imagined
though
weak
had
fought
the
indian
good
while
and
had
cut
two
great
wounds
his
head
but
the
savage
being
stout
lusty
fellow
closing
with
him
had
thrown
him
down
being
faint
and
was
wringing
sword
out
his
hand
when
the
spaniard
though
undermost
wisely
quitting
the
sword
drew
the
pistol
from
his
girdle
shot
the
savage
through
the
body
and
killed
him
upon
the
spot
before
who
was
running
help
him
could
come
near
him
friday
being
now
left
his
liberty
pursued
the
flying
wretches
with
weapon
his
hand
but
his
hatchet
and
with
that
despatched
those
three
who
said
before
were
wounded
first
and
fallen
and
all
the
rest
could
come
with
and
the
spaniard
coming
for
gun
gave
him
one
the
fowling
pieces
with
which
pursued
two
the
savages
and
wounded
them
both
but
was
not
able
run
they
both
got
from
him
into
the
wood
where
friday
pursued
them
and
killed
one
them
but
the
other
was
too
nimble
for
him
and
though
was
wounded
yet
had
plunged
himself
into
the
sea
and
swam
with
all
his
might
off
those
two
who
were
left
the
canoe
which
three
the
canoe
with
one
wounded
that
knew
not
whether
died
were
all
that
escaped
our
hands
one
and
twenty
the

all
those
that
were
the

worked
hard
get
out
gun
shot
and
though
friday
made
two
three
shots
them
did
not
find
that
hit
any
them
friday
would
fain
have
had
take
one
their
canoes
and
pursue
them
and
indeed
was
very
anxious
about
their
escape
lest
carrying
the
news
home
their
people
they
should
come
back
perhaps
with
two
three
hundred
the
canoes
and
devour
mere
multitude
consented
pursue
them
sea
and
running
one
their
canoes
jumped
and
bade
friday
follow
but
when
was
the
canoe
was
surprised
find
another
poor
creature
lie
there
bound
hand
and
foot
the
spaniard
was
for
the
slaughter
and
almost
dead
with
fear
not
knowing
what
was
the
matter
for
had
not
been
able
look
over
the
side
the
boat
was
tied
hard
neck
and
heels
and
had
been
tied
long
that
had
really
but
little
life
him
immediately
cut
the
twisted
flags
rushes
which
they
had
bound
him
with
and
would
have
helped
him
but
could
not
stand
speak
but
groaned
most
piteously
believing
seems
still
that
was
only
unbound
order
killed
when
friday
came
him
bade
him
speak
him
and
tell
him
his
deliverance
and
pulling
out
bottle
made
him
give
the
poor
wretch
dram
which
with
the
news
his
being
delivered
revived
him
and
sat
the
boat
but
when
friday
came
hear
him
speak
and
look
his
face
would
have
moved
any
one
tears
have
seen
how
friday
kissed
him
embraced
him
hugged
him
cried
laughed
hallooed
jumped
about
danced
sang
then
cried
again
wrung
his
hands
beat
his
own
face
and
head
and
then
sang
and
jumped
about
again
like
distracted
creature
was
good
while
before
could
make
him
speak
tell
what
was
the
matter
but
when
came
little
himself
told
that
was
his
father
not
easy
for
express
how
moved
see
what
ecstasy
and
filial
affection
had
worked
this
poor
savage
the
sight
his
father
and
his
being
delivered
from
death
nor
indeed
can
describe
half
the
extravagances
his
affection
after
this
for
went
into
the
boat
and
out
the
boat
great
many
times
when
went
him
would
sit
down
him
open
his
breast
and
hold
his
father
head
close
his
bosom
for
many
minutes
together
nourish
then
took
his
arms
and
ankles
which
were
numbed
and
stiff
with
the
binding
and
chafed
and
rubbed
them
with
his
hands
and
perceiving
what
the
case
was
gave
him
some
rum
out
bottle
rub
them
with
which
did
them
great
deal
good
this
affair
put
end
our
pursuit
the
canoe
with
the
other
savages
who
were
now
almost
out
sight
and
was
happy
for
that
did
not
for
blew
hard
within
two
hours
after
and
before
they
could
got
quarter
their
way
and
continued
blowing
hard
all
night
and
that
from
the
north
west
which
was
against
them
that
could
not
suppose
their
boat
could
live
that
they
ever
reached
their
own
coast
but
return
friday
was
busy
about
his
father
that
could
not
find
heart
take
him
off
for
some
time
but
after
thought
could
leave
him
little
called
him
and
came
jumping
and
laughing
and
pleased
the
highest
extreme
then
asked
him

given
his
father
any
bread
shook
his
head
and
said
none

self
then
gave
him

three
bunches
raisins

him
handful

for
his
father
had
sooner
given
his
father
these
raisins
but
saw
him
come
out
the
boat
and
run
away
had
been
bewitched
for
was
the
swiftest
fellow
his
feet
that
ever
saw
say
ran
such
rate
that
was
out
sight
were
instant
and
though
called
and
hallooed
out
too
after
him
was
all
one
away
went
and
quarter
hour
saw
him
come
back
again
though
not
fast
went
and
came
nearer
found
his
pace
slacker
because
had
something
his
hand
when
came
found
had
been
quite
home
for
earthen
jug
pot

his
father
some
fresh
water
and
that
had
got
two
more
cakes
loaves
bread
the
bread
gave
but
the
water
carried
his
father
however
was
very
thirsty
too
took
little
the
water
revived
his
father
more
than
all
the
rum
spirits
had
given
him
for
was
fainting
with
thirst
when
his
father
had
drunk
called
him
know
there
was
any
water
left
said
yes
and
bade
him
give
the
poor
spaniard
who
was
much
want
his
father
and
sent
one
the
cakes
that
friday
brought
the
spaniard
too
who
was
indeed
very
weak
and
was
reposing
himself
upon
green
place
under
the
shade
tree
and
whose
limbs
were
also
very
stiff
and
very
much
swelled
with
the
rude
bandage
had
been
tied
with
when
saw
that
upon
friday
coming
him
with
the
water
sat
and
drank
and
took
the
bread
and
began
eat
went
him
and
gave
him
handful
raisins
looked
face
with
all
the
tokens
gratitude
and
thankfulness
that
could
appear
any
countenance
but
was
weak
notwithstanding
had
exerted
himself
the
fight
that
could
not
stand
upon
his
feet
tried
two
three
times
but
was
really
not
able
his
ankles
were
swelled
and
painful
him
bade
him
sit
still
and
caused
friday
rub
his
ankles
and
bathe
them
with
rum
had
done
his
father
observed
the
poor
affectionate
creature
every
two
minutes
perhaps
less
all
the
while
was
here
turn
his
head
about
see
his
father
was
the
same
place
and
posture
left
him
sitting
and
last
found
was
not
seen
which
started
and
without
speaking
word
flew
with
that
swiftness
him
that
one
could
scarce
perceive
his
feet
touch
the
ground
went
but
when
came
only
found
had
laid
himself
down
ease
his
limbs
friday
came
back
presently
and
then
spoke
the
spaniard
let
friday
help
him
could
and
lead
him
the
boat
and
then
should
carry
him
our
dwelling
where
would
take
care
him
but
friday
lusty
strong
fellow
took
the
spaniard
upon
his
back
and
carried
him
away
the
boat
and
set
him
down
softly
upon
the
side
gunnel
the
canoe
with
his
feet
the
inside
and
then
lifting
him
quite
set
him
close
his
father
and
presently
stepping
out
again
launched
the
boat
off
and
paddled
along
the
shore
faster
than
could
walk
though
the
wind
blew
pretty
hard
too
brought
them
both
safe
into
our
creek
and
leaving
them
the
boat
ran
away
fetch
the
other
canoe
passed
spoke
him
and
asked
him
whither
went
told
fetch
more
boat
away
went
like
the
wind
for
sure
never
man
horse
ran
like
him
and
had
the
other
canoe
the
creek
almost
soon
got
land
wafted
over
and
then
went
help
our
new
guests
out
the
boat
which
did
but
they
were
neither
them
able
walk
that
poor
friday
knew
not
what
remedy
this
went
work
thought
and
calling
friday
bid
them
sit
down
the
bank
while
came
soon
made
kind
hand
barrow
lay
them
and
friday
and
carried
them
both
together
upon
between
but
when
got
them
the
outside
our
wall
fortification
were
worse
loss
than
before
for
was
impossible
get
them
over
and
was
resolved
not
break
down
set
work
again
and
friday
and
about
two
hours
time
made
very
handsome
tent
covered
with
old
sails
and
above
that
with
boughs
trees
being
the
space
without
our
outward
fence
and
between
that
and
the
grove
young
wood
which
had
planted
and
here
made
them
two
beds
such
things
had
viz
good
rice
straw
with
blankets
laid
upon
lie
and
another
cover
them
each
bed
island
was
now
peopled
and
thought
myself
very
rich
subjects
and
was
merry
reflection
which
frequently
made
how
like
king
looked
first
all
the
whole
country
was
own
property
that
had
undoubted
right
dominion
secondly
people
were
perfectly
subjected
was
absolutely
lord
and
lawgiver
they
all
owed
their
lives
and
were
ready
lay
down
their
lives
there
had
been
occasion
for
for
was
remarkable
too
had
but
three
subjects
and
they
were
three
different
religions
man
friday
was
protestant
his
father
was
pagan
and
cannibal
and
the
spaniard
was
papist
however
allowed
liberty
conscience
throughout
dominions
but
this
the
way
soon
had
secured
two
weak
rescued
prisoners
and
given
them
shelter
and
place
rest
them
upon
began
think
making
some
provision
for
them
and
the
first
thing
did
ordered
friday
take
yearling
goat
betwixt
kid
and
goat
out
particular
flock
killed
when
cut
off
the
hinder
quarter
and
chopping
into
small
pieces
set
friday
work
boiling
and
stewing
and
made
them
very
good
dish
assure
you
flesh
and
broth
and
cooked
without
doors
for
made
fire
within
inner
wall
carried
all
into
the
new
tent
and
having
set
table
there
for
them
sat
down
and
ate
own
dinner
also
with
them
and
well
could
cheered
them
and
encouraged
them
friday
was
interpreter
especially
his
father
and
indeed
the
spaniard
too
for
the
spaniard
spoke
the
language
the
savages
pretty
well
after
had
dined
rather
supped
ordered
friday
take
one
the
canoes
and
and
fetch
our
muskets
and
other
firearms
which
for
want
time
had
left
upon
the
place
battle
and
the
next
day
ordered
him
and
bury
the
dead
bodies
the
savages
which
lay
open
the
sun
and
would
presently
offensive
also
ordered
him
bury
the
horrid
remains
their
barbarous
feast
which
could
not
think
doing
myself
nay
could
not
bear
see
them
went
that
way
all
which
punctually
performed
and
effaced
the
very
appearance
the
savages
being
there
that
when
went
again
could
scarce
know
where
was
otherwise
than
the
corner
the
wood
pointing
the
place
then
began
enter
into
little
conversation
with
two
new
subjects
and
first
set
friday
inquire
his
father
what
thought
the
escape
the
savages
that
canoe
and
whether
might
expect
return
them
with
power
too
great
for
resist
his
first
opinion
was
that
the
savages
the
boat
never
could
live
out
the
storm
which
blew
that
night
they
went
off
but
must
necessity
drowned
driven
south
those
other
shores
where
they
were
sure
devoured
they
were
drowned
they
were
cast
away
but
what
they
would
they
came
safe
shore
said
knew
not
but
was
his
opinion
that
they
were
dreadfully
frightened
with
the
manner
their
being
attacked
the
noise
and
the
fire
that
believed
they
would
tell
the
people
they
were
all
killed
thunder
and
lightning
not
the
hand
man
and
that
the
two
which
appeared
viz
friday
and
were
two
heavenly
spirits
furies
come
down
destroy
them
and
not
men
with
weapons
this
said
knew
because
heard
them
all
cry
out
their
language
one
another
for
was
impossible
for
them
conceive
that
man
could
dart
fire
and
speak
thunder
and
kill
distance
without
lifting
the
hand
was
done
now
and
this
old
savage
was
the
right
for
understood
since
other
hands
the
savages
never
attempted
over
the
island
afterwards
they
were
terrified
with
the
accounts
given
those
four
men
for
seems
they
did
escape
the
sea
that
they
believed
whoever
went
that
enchanted
island
would
destroyed
with
fire
from
the
gods
this
however
knew
not
and
therefore
was
under
continual
apprehensions
for
good
while
and
kept
always
upon
guard
with
all
army
for
there
were
now
four
would
have
ventured
upon
hundred
them
fairly
the
open
field
any
time
chapter
xvii
visit
mutineers
little
time
however
more
canoes
appearing
the
fear
their
coming
wore
off
and
began
take
former
thoughts
voyage
the
main
into
consideration
being
likewise
assured
friday
father
that
might
depend
upon
good
usage
from
their
nation
his
account
would
but
thoughts
were
little
suspended
when
had
serious
discourse
with
the
spaniard
and
when
understood
that
there
were
sixteen
more
his
countrymen
and
portuguese
who
having
been
cast
away
and
made
their
escape
that
side
lived
there
peace
indeed
with
the
savages
but
were
very
sore
put
for
necessaries
and
indeed
for
life
asked
him
all
the
particulars
their
voyage
and
found
they
were
spanish
ship
bound
from
the
rio
plata
the
havanna
being
directed
leave
their
loading
there
which
was
chiefly
hides
and
silver
and
bring
back
what
european
goods
they
could
meet
with
there
that
they
had
five
portuguese
seamen
board
whom
they
took
out
another
wreck
that
five
their
own
men
were
drowned
when
first
the
ship
was
lost
and
that
these
escaped
through
infinite
dangers
and
hazards
and
arrived
almost
starved
the
cannibal
coast
where
they
expected
have
been
devoured
every
moment
told
they
had
some
arms
with
them
but
they
were
perfectly
useless
for
that
they
had
neither
powder
nor
ball
the
washing
the
sea
having
spoiled
all
their
powder
but
little
which
they
used
their
first
landing
provide
themselves
with
some
food
asked
him
what
thought
would
become
them
there
and
they
had
formed
any
design
making
their
escape
said
they
had
many
consultations
about
but
that
having
neither
vessel
nor
tools
build
one
nor
provisions
any
kind
their
councils
always
ended
tears
and
despair
asked
him
how
thought
they
would
receive
proposal
from
which
might
tend
towards
escape
and
whether
they
were
all
here
might
not
done
told
him
with
freedom
feared
mostly
their
treachery
and
ill
usage
put
life
their
hands
for
that
gratitude
was
inherent
virtue
the
nature
man
nor
did
men
always
square
their
dealings
the
obligations
they
had
received
much
they
did
the
advantages
they
expected
told
him
would
very
hard
that
should
made
the
instrument
their
deliverance
and
that
they
should
afterwards
make
their
prisoner
new
spain
where
englishman
was
certain
made
sacrifice
what
necessity
what
accident
soever
brought
him
thither
and
that
had
rather
delivered
the
savages
and
devoured
alive
than
fall
into
the
merciless
claws
the
priests
and
carried
into
the
inquisition
added
that
otherwise
was
persuaded
they
were
all
here
might
with
many
hands
build
barque
large
enough
carry
all
away
either
the
brazils
southward
the
islands
spanish
coast
northward
but
that
requital
they
should
when
had
put
weapons
into
their
hands
carry
force
among
their
own
people
might
ill
used
for
kindness
them
and
make
case
worse
than
was
before
answered
with
great
deal
candour
and
ingenuousness
that
their
condition
was
miserable
and
that
they
were
sensible
that
believed
they
would
abhor
the
thought
using
any
man
unkindly
that
should
contribute
their
deliverance
and
that
pleased
would
them
with
the
old
man
and
discourse
with
them
about
and
return
again
and
bring
their
answer
that
would
make
conditions
with
them
upon
their
solemn
oath
that
they
should
absolutely
under
direction
their
commander
and
captain
and
they
should
swear
upon
the
holy
sacraments
and
gospel
true
and
such
christian
country
should
agree
and
other
and
directed
wholly
and
absolutely
orders
till
they
were
landed
safely
such
country
intended
and
that
would
bring
contract
from
them
under
their
hands
for
that
purpose
then
told
would
first
swear
himself
that
would
never
stir
from
long
lived
till
gave
him
orders
and
that
would
take
side
the
last
drop
his
blood
there
should
happen
the
least
breach
faith
among
his
countrymen
told
they
were
all
them
very
civil
honest
men
and
they
were
under
the
greatest
distress
imaginable
having
neither
weapons
nor
clothes
nor
any
food
but
the
mercy
and
discretion
the
savages
out
all
hopes
ever
returning
their
own
country
and
that
was
sure
would
undertake
their
relief
they
would
live
and
die
upon
these
assurances
resolved
venture
relieve
them
possible
and
send
the
old
savage
and
this
spaniard
over
them
treat
but
when
had
got
all
things
readiness
the
spaniard
himself
started
objection
which
had
much
prudence
one
hand
and
much
sincerity
the
other
hand
that
could
not
but
very
well
satisfied
and
his
advice
put
off
the
deliverance
his
comrades
for
least
half
year
the
case
was
thus
had
been
with
now
about
month
during
which
time
had
let
him
see
what
manner
had
provided
with
the
assistance
providence
for
support
and
saw
evidently
what
stock
corn
and
rice
had
laid
which
though
was
more
than
sufficient
for
myself
yet
was
not
sufficient
without
good
husbandry
for
family
now
was
increased
four
but
much
less
would
sufficient
his
countrymen
who
were
said
sixteen
still
alive
should
come
over
and
least
all
would
sufficient
victual
our
vessel
should
build
one
for
voyage
any
the
christian
colonies
america
told
thought
would
more
advisable
let
him
and
the
other
two
dig
and
cultivate
some
more
land
much
could
spare
seed
sow
and
that
should
wait
another
harvest
that
might
have
supply
corn
for
his
countrymen
when
they
should
come
for
want
might
temptation
them
disagree
not
think
themselves
delivered
otherwise
than
out
one
difficulty
into
another
you
know
says
the
children
israel
though
they
rejoiced
first
for
their
being
delivered
out
egypt
yet
rebelled
even
against
god
himself
that
delivered
them
when
they
came
want
bread
the
wilderness
his
caution
was
seasonable
and
his
advice
good
that
could
not
but
very
well
pleased
with
his
proposal
well
was
satisfied
with
his
fidelity
fell
digging
all
four
well
the
wooden
tools
were
furnished
with
permitted
and
about
month
time
the
end
which
was
seed
time
had
got
much
land
cured
and
trimmed
sowed
two
and
twenty
bushels
barley
and
sixteen
jars
rice
which
was
short
all
the
seed
had
spare
indeed
left
ourselves
barely
sufficient
for
our
own
food
for
the
six
months
that
had
expect
our
crop
that
say
reckoning
from
the
time
set
our
seed
aside
for
sowing
for
not
supposed
six
months
the
ground
that
country
having
now
society
enough
and
our
numbers
being
sufficient
put
out
fear
the
savages
they
had
come
unless
their
number
had
been
very
great
went
freely
all
over
the
island
whenever
found
occasion
and
had
our
escape
deliverance
upon
our
thoughts
was
impossible
least
for
have
the
means
out
mine
for
this
purpose
marked
out
several
trees
which
thought
fit
for
our
work
and
set
friday
and
his
father
cut
them
down
and
then
caused
the
spaniard
whom
imparted
thoughts
that
affair
oversee
and
direct
their
work
showed
them
with
what
indefatigable
pains
had
hewed
large
tree
into
single
planks
and
caused
them
the
like
till
they
made
about
dozen
large
planks
good
oak
near
two
feet
broad
thirty
five
feet
long
and
from
two
inches
four
inches
thick
what
prodigious
labour
took
any
one
may
imagine
the
same
time
contrived
increase
little
flock
tame
goats
much
could
and
for
this
purpose
made
friday
and
the
spaniard
out
one
day
and
myself
with
friday
the
next
day
for
took
our
turns
and
this
means
got
about
twenty
young
kids
breed
with
the
rest
for
whenever
shot
the
dam
saved
the
kids
and
added
them
our
flock
but
above
all
the
season
for
curing
the
grapes
coming
caused
such
prodigious
quantity
hung
the
sun
that
believe
had
been
alicant
where
the
raisins
the
sun
are
cured
could
have
filled
sixty
eighty
barrels
and
these
with
our
bread
formed
great
part
our
food
very
good
living
too
assure
you
for
they
are
exceedingly
nourishing
was
now
harvest
and
our
crop
good
order
was
not
the
most
plentiful
increase
had
seen
the
island
but
however
was
enough
answer
our
end
for
from
twenty
two
bushels
barley
brought
and
thrashed
out
above
two
hundred
and
twenty
bushels
and
the
like
proportion
the
rice
which
was
store
enough
for
our
food
the
next
harvest
though
all
the
sixteen
spaniards
had
been
shore
with
had
been
ready
for
voyage
would
very
plentifully
have
victualled
our
ship
have
carried
any
part
the
world
that
say
any
part
america
when
had
thus
housed
and
secured
our
magazine
corn
fell
work
make
more
wicker
ware
viz
great
baskets
which
kept
and
the
spaniard
was
very
handy
and
dexterous
this
part
and
often
blamed
that
did
not
make
some
things
for
defence
this
kind
work
but
saw
need
and
now
having
full
supply
food
for
all
the
guests
expected
gave
the
spaniard
leave
over
the
main
see
what
could
with
those
had
left
behind
him
there
gave
him
strict
charge
not
bring
any
man
who
would
not
first
swear
the
presence
himself
and
the
old
savage
that
would
way
injure
fight
with
attack
the
person
should
find
the
island
who
was
kind
send
for
them
order
their
deliverance
but
that
they
would
stand
him
and
defend
him
against
all
such
attempts
and
wherever
they
went
would
entirely
under
and
subjected
his
command
and
that
this
should
put
writing
and
signed
their
hands
how
they
were
have
done
this
when
knew
they
had
neither
pen
nor
ink
was
question
which
never
asked
under
these
instructions
the
spaniard
and
the
old
savage
the
father
friday
went
away
one
the
canoes
which
they
might
said
have
come
rather
were
brought
when
they
came
prisoners
devoured
the
savages
gave
each
them
musket
with
firelock
and
about
eight
charges
powder
and
ball
charging
them
very
good
husbands
both
and
not
use
either
them
but
upon
urgent
occasions
this
was
cheerful
work
being
the
first
measures
used
view
deliverance
for
now
twenty
seven
years
and
some
days
gave
them
provisions
bread
and
dried
grapes
sufficient
for
themselves
for
many
days
and
sufficient
for
all
the
spaniards
for
about
eight
days
time
and
wishing
them
good
voyage
saw
them
agreeing
with
them
about
signal
they
should
hang
out
their
return
which
should
know
them
again
when
they
came
back
distance
before
they
came
shore
they
went
away
with
fair
gale
the
day
that
the
moon
was
full
account
the
month
october
but
for
exact
reckoning
days
after
had
once
lost
could
never
recover
again
nor
had
kept
even
the
number
years
punctually
sure
was
right
though
proved
when
afterwards
examined
account
found
had
kept
true
reckoning
years
was
less
than
eight
days
had
waited
for
them
when
strange
and
unforeseen
accident
intervened
which
the
like
has
not
perhaps
been
heard
history
was
fast
asleep
hutch
one
morning
when
man
friday
came
running
and
called
aloud
master
master
they
are
come
they
are
come
jumped
and
regardless
danger
went
soon
could
get
clothes
through
little
grove
which
the
way
was
this
time
grown
very
thick
wood
say
regardless
danger
went
without
arms
which
was
not
custom
but
was
surprised
when
turning
eyes
the
sea
presently
saw
boat
about
league
and
half
distance
standing
for
the
shore
with
shoulder
mutton
sail
they
call
and
the
wind
blowing
pretty
fair
bring
them
also
observed
presently
that
they
did
not
come
from
that
side
which
the
shore
lay
but
from
the
southernmost
end
the
island
upon
this
called
friday
and
bade
him
lie
close
for
these
were
not
the
people
looked
for
and
that
might
not
know
yet
whether
they
were
friends
enemies
the
next
place
went
fetch
perspective
glass
see
what
could
make
them
and
having
taken
the
ladder
out
climbed
the
top
the
hill
used
when
was
apprehensive
anything
and
take
view
the
plainer
without
being
discovered
had
scarce
set
foot
upon
the
hill
when
eye
plainly
discovered
ship
lying
anchor
about
two
leagues
and
half
distance
from
sse
but
not
above
league
and
half
from
the
shore
observation
appeared
plainly
english
ship
and
the
boat
appeared
english
long
boat
cannot
express
the
confusion
was
though
the
joy
seeing
ship
and
one
that
had
reason
believe
was
manned
own
countrymen
and
consequently
friends
was
such
cannot
describe
but
yet
had
some
secret
doubts
hung
about
cannot
tell
from
whence
they
came
bidding
keep
upon
guard
the
first
place
occurred
consider
what
business
english
ship
could
have
that
part
the
world
since
was
not
the
way
from
any
part
the
world
where
the
english
had
any
traffic
and
knew
there
had
been
storms
drive
them
there
distress
and
that
they
were
really
english
was
most
probable
that
they
were
here
upon
good
design
and
that
had
better
continue
was
than
fall
into
the
hands
thieves
and
murderers
let
man
despise
the
secret
hints
and
notices
danger
which
sometimes
are
given
him
when
may
think
there
possibility
its
being
real
that
such
hints
and
notices
are
given
believe
few
that
have
made
any
observation
things
can
deny
that
they
are
certain
discoveries
invisible
world
and
converse
spirits
cannot
doubt
and
the
tendency
them
seems
warn
danger
why
should
not
suppose
they
are
from
some
friendly
agent
whether
supreme
inferior
and
subordinate
not
the
question
and
that
they
are
given
for
our
good
the
present
question
abundantly
confirms
the
justice
this
reasoning
for
had
not
been
made
cautious
this
secret
admonition
come
from
whence
will
had
been
done
inevitably
and
far
worse
condition
than
before
you
will
see
presently
had
not
kept
myself
long
this
posture
till
saw
the
boat
draw
near
the
shore
they
looked
for
creek
thrust
for
the
convenience
landing
however
they
did
not
come
quite
far
enough
they
did
not
see
the
little
inlet
where
formerly
landed
rafts
but
ran
their
boat
shore
upon
the
beach
about
half
mile
from
which
was
very
happy
for
for
otherwise
they
would
have
landed
just
door
may
say
and
would
soon
have
beaten
out
castle
and
perhaps
have
plundered
all
had
when
they
were
shore
was
fully
satisfied
they
were
englishmen
least
most
them
one
two
thought
were
dutch
but
did
not
prove
there
were
all
eleven
men
whereof
three
them
found
were
unarmed
and
thought
bound
and
when
the
first
four
five
them
were
jumped
shore
they
took
those
three
out
the
boat
prisoners
one
the
three
could
perceive
using
the
most
passionate
gestures
entreaty
affliction
and
despair
even
kind
extravagance
the
other
two
could
perceive
lifted
their
hands
sometimes
and
appeared
concerned
indeed
but
not
such
degree
the
first
was
perfectly
confounded
the
sight
and
knew
not
what
the
meaning
should
friday
called
out
english
well
could
master
you
see
english
mans
eat
prisoner
well
savage
mans
why
friday
says
you
think
they
are
going
eat
them
then
yes
says
friday
they
will
eat
them
says
friday
afraid
they
will
murder
them
indeed
but
you
may
sure
they
will
not
eat
them
all
this
while
had
thought
what
the
matter
really
was
but
stood
trembling
with
the
horror
the
sight
expecting
every
moment
when
the
three
prisoners
should
killed
nay
once
saw
one
the
villains
lift
his
arm
with
great
cutlass
the
seamen
call
sword
strike
one
the
poor
men
and
expected
see
him
fall
every
moment
which
all
the
blood
body
seemed
run
chill
veins
wished
heartily
now
for
the
spaniard
and
the
savage
that
had
gone
with
him
that
had
any
way
have
come
undiscovered
within
shot
them
that
might
have
secured
the
three
men
for
saw
firearms
they
had
among
them
but
fell
out
mind
another
way
after
had
observed
the
outrageous
usage
the
three
men
the
insolent
seamen
observed
the
fellows
run
scattering
about
the
island
they
wanted
see
the
country
observed
that
the
three
other
men
had
liberty
also
where
they
pleased
but
they
sat
down
all
three
upon
the
ground
very
pensive
and
looked
like
men
despair
this
put
mind
the
first
time
when
came
shore
and
began
look
about
how
gave
myself
over
for
lost
how
wildly
looked
round
what
dreadful
apprehensions
had
and
how
lodged
the
tree
all
night
for
fear
being
devoured
wild
beasts
knew
nothing
that
night
the
supply
was
receive
the
providential
driving
the
ship
nearer
the
land
the
storms
and
tide
which
have
since
been
long
nourished
and
supported
these
three
poor
desolate
men
knew
nothing
how
certain
deliverance
and
supply
they
were
how
near
was
them
and
how
effectually
and
really
they
were
condition
safety
the
same
time
that
they
thought
themselves
lost
and
their
case
desperate
little
see
before
the
world
and
much
reason
have
depend
cheerfully
upon
the
great
maker
the
world
that
does
not
leave
his
creatures
absolutely
destitute
but
that
the
worst
circumstances
they
have
always
something
thankful
for
and
sometimes
are
nearer
deliverance
than
they
imagine
nay
are
even
brought
their
deliverance
the
means
which
they
seem
brought
their
destruction
was
just
high
water
when
these
people
came
shore
and
while
they
rambled
about
see
what
kind
place
they
were
they
had
carelessly
stayed
till
the
tide
was
spent
and
the
water
was
ebbed
considerably
away
leaving
their
boat
aground
they
had
left
two
men
the
boat
who
found
afterwards
having
drunk
little
too
much
brandy
fell
asleep
however
one
them
waking
little
sooner
than
the
other
and
finding
the
boat
too
fast
aground
for
him
stir
hallooed
out
for
the
rest
who
were
straggling
about
upon
which
they
all
soon
came
the
boat
but
was
past
all
their
strength
launch
her
the
boat
being
very
heavy
and
the
shore
that
side
being
soft
oozy
sand
almost
like
quicksand
this
condition
like
true
seamen
who
are
perhaps
the
least
all
mankind
given
forethought
they
gave
over
and
away
they
strolled
about
the
country
again
and
heard
one
them
say
aloud
another
calling
them
off
from
the
boat
why
let
her
alone
jack
can
you
she
float
next
tide
which
was
fully
confirmed
the
main
inquiry
what
countrymen
they
were
all
this
while
kept
myself
very
close
not
once
daring
stir
out
castle
any
farther
than
place
observation
near
the
top
the
hill
and
very
glad
was
think
how
well
was
fortified
knew
was
less
than
ten
hours
before
the
boat
could
float
again
and
that
time
would
dark
and
might
more
liberty
see
their
motions
and
hear
their
discourse
they
had
any
the
meantime
fitted
myself
for
battle
before
though
with
more
caution
knowing
had
with
another
kind
enemy
than
had
first
ordered
friday
also
whom
had
made
excellent
marksman
with
his
gun
load
himself
with
arms
took
myself
two
fowling
pieces
and
gave
him

was
design
said
above
not
have
made
any
attempt
till
was
dark
but
about
two
clock
being
the
heat
the
day
found
that
they
were
all
gone
straggling
into
the
woods
and
thought
laid
down
sleep
the
three
poor
distressed
men
too
anxious
for
their
condition
get
any
sleep
had
however
sat
down
under
the
shelter
great
tree
about
quarter
mile
from
and
thought
out

the
rest
upon
this
resolved
discover
myself
them
and
learn
something
their
condition
immediately
marched
above
man

distance
behind
formidable
for
his
arms
but
not
making
quite
staring
spectre
like

near
them
undiscovered
could
and
then
before
any
them
saw
called
aloud
them
spanish
what
are
gentlemen
they
started
the
noise
but
were
ten
times
more
confounded
when
they
saw
and
the
uncouth
figure
that
made
they
made
answer
all
but
thought
perceived
them
just
going
fly
from

them
english

surprised

may
have
friend

his
sword

you
the
poor
man

down

face
and
trembling

against
they

and
last
have
set

this
desolate
place
with
these
two
men
with
one
mate

other
passenger
where
expected

believing
the
place
uninhabited
and
know
not

they
any
firearms
said
answered
they
had
only
two
pieces
one
which
they
left
the
boat
well
then
said
leave
the
rest
see
they
are
all
asleep
easy
thing
kill
them
all
but
shall
rather
take
them
prisoners
told
there
were
two
desperate
villains
among
them
that
was
scarce
safe
show
any
mercy
but
they
were
secured
believed
all
the
rest
would
return
their
duty
asked
him
which
they
were
told
could
not
that
distance
distinguish
them
but
would
obey
orders
anything
would
direct
well
says
let
retreat
out
their
view
hearing
lest
they
awake
and
will
resolve
further
they
willingly
went
back
with
till
the
woods
covered
from
them
look
you
sir
said
venture
upon
your
deliverance
are
you
willing
make
two
conditions
with
anticipated
proposals
telling
that
both
and
the
ship
recovered
should
wholly
directed
and
commanded
everything
and
the
ship
was
not
recovered
would
live
and
die
with
what
part
the
world
soever
would
send
him
and
the
two
other
men
said
the
same
well
says
conditions
are
but
two
first
that
while
you
stay
this
island
with
you
will
not
pretend
any
authority
here
and
put
arms
your
hands
you
will
upon
all
occasions
give
them
and
prejudice
mine
upon
this
island
and
the
meantime
governed
orders
secondly
that
the
ship
may
recovered
you
will
carry
and
man
england
passage
free
gave
all
the
assurances
that
the
invention
faith
man
could
devise
that
would
comply
with
these
most
reasonable
demands
and
besides
would
owe
his
life
and
acknowledge
upon
all
occasions
long
lived
well
then
said
here
are
three
muskets
for
you
with
powder
and
ball
tell
next
what
you
think
proper
done
showed
all
the
testimonies
his
gratitude
that
was
able
but
offered
wholly
guided
told
him
thought
was
very
hard
venturing
anything
but
the
best
method
could
think
was
fire
them
once
they
lay
and
any
were
not
killed
the
first
volley
and
offered
submit
might
save
them
and
put
wholly
upon
god
providence
direct
the
shot
said
very
modestly
that
was
loath
kill
them
could
help
but
that
those
two
were
incorrigible
villains
and
had
been
the
authors
all
the
mutiny
the
ship
and
they
escaped
should
undone
still
for
they
would
board
and
bring
the
whole
ship
company
and
destroy
all
well
then
says
necessity
legitimates
advice
for
the
only
way
save
our
lives
however
seeing
him
still
cautious
shedding
blood
told
him
they
should
themselves
and
manage
they
found
convenient
the
middle
this
discourse
heard
some
them
awake
and
soon
after
saw
two
them
their
feet
asked
him
either
them
were
the
heads
the
mutiny
said
well
then
said
you
may
let
them
escape
and
providence
seems
have
awakened
them
purpose
save
themselves
now
says
the
rest
escape
you
your
fault
animated
with
this
took
the
musket
had
given
him
his
hand
and
pistol
his
belt
and
his
two
comrades
with
him
with
each
piece
his
hand
the
two
men
who
were
with
him
going
first
made
some
noise
which
one
the
seamen
who
was
awake
turned
about
and
seeing
them
coming
cried
out
the
rest
but
was
too
late
then
for
the
moment
cried
out
they
fired
mean
the
two
men
the
captain
wisely
reserving
his
own
piece
they
had
well
aimed
their
shot
the
men
they
knew
that
one
them
was
killed
the
spot
and
the
other
very
much
wounded
but
not
being
dead
started
his
feet
and
called
eagerly
for
help
the
other
but
the
captain
stepping
him
told
him
was
too
late
cry
for
help
should
call
upon
god
forgive
his
villainy
and
with
that
word
knocked
him
down
with
the
stock
his
musket
that
never
spoke
more
there
were
three
more
the
company
and
one
them
was
slightly
wounded
this
time
was
come
and
when
they
saw
their
danger
and
that
was
vain
resist
they
begged
for
mercy
the
captain
told
them
would
spare
their
lives
they
would
give
him
assurance
their
abhorrence
the
treachery
they
had
been
guilty
and
would
swear
faithful
him
recovering
the
ship
and
afterwards
carrying
her
back
jamaica
from
whence
they
came
they
gave
him
all
the
protestations
their
sincerity
that
could
desired
and
was
willing
believe
them
and
spare
their
lives
which
was
not
against
only
that
obliged
him
keep
them
bound
hand
and
foot
while
they
were
the
island
while
this
was
doing
sent
friday
with
the
captain
mate
the
boat
with
orders
secure
her
and
bring
away
the
oars
and
sails
which
they
did
and
and
three
straggling
men
that
were
happily
for
them
parted
from
the
rest
came
back
upon
hearing
the
guns
fired
and
seeing
the
captain
who
was
before
their
prisoner
now
their
conqueror
they
submitted
bound
also
and
our
victory
was
complete
now
remained
that
the
captain
and
should
inquire
into
one
another
circumstances
began
first
and
told
him
whole
history
which
heard
with
attention
even
amazement
and
particularly
the
wonderful
manner
being
furnished
with
provisions
and
ammunition
and
indeed
story
whole
collection
wonders
affected
him
deeply
but
when
reflected
from
thence
upon
himself
and
how
seemed
have
been
preserved
there
purpose
save
his
life
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
and
could
not
speak
word
more
after
this
communication
was
end
carried
him
and
his
two
men
into
apartment
leading
them
just
where
came
out
viz
the
top
the
house
where
refreshed
them
with
such
provisions
had
and
showed
them
all
the
contrivances
had
made
during
long
long
inhabiting
that
place
all
showed
them
all
said
them
was
perfectly
amazing
but
above
all
the
captain
admired
fortification
and
how
perfectly
had
concealed
retreat
with
grove
trees
which
having
been
now
planted
nearly
twenty
years
and
the
trees
growing
much
faster
than
england
was
become
little
wood
thick
that
was
impassable
any
part
but
that
one
side
where
had
reserved
little
winding
passage
into
told
him
this
was
castle
and
residence
but
that
had
seat
the
country
most
princes
have
whither
could
retreat
upon
occasion
and
would
show
him
that
too
another
time
but
present
our
business
was
consider
how
recover
the
ship
agreed
with
that
but
told
was
perfectly
loss
what
measures
take
for
that
there
were
still
six
and
twenty
hands
board
who
having
entered
into
cursed
conspiracy
which
they
had
all
forfeited
their
lives
the
law
would
hardened
now
desperation
and
would
carry
knowing
that
they
were
subdued
they
would
brought
the
gallows
soon
they
came
england
any
the
english
colonies
and
that
therefore
there
would
attacking
them
with
small
number
were
mused
for
some
time
what
had
said
and
found
was
very
rational
conclusion
and
that
therefore
something
was
resolved
speedily
well
draw
the
men
board
into
some
snare
for
their
surprise
prevent
their
landing
upon
and
destroying
upon
this
presently
occurred
that
little
while
the
ship
crew
wondering
what
was
become
their
comrades
and
the
boat
would
certainly
come
shore
their
other
boat
look
for
them
and
that
then
perhaps
they
might
come
armed
and
too
strong
for
this
allowed
rational
upon
this
told
him
the
first
thing
had
was
stave
the
boat
which
lay
upon
the
beach
that
they
might
not
carry
her
and
taking
everything
out
her
leave
her
far
useless
not
fit
swim
accordingly
went
board
took
the
arms
which
were
left
board
out
her
and
whatever
else
found
there
which
was
bottle
brandy
and
another
rum
few
biscuit
cakes
horn
powder
and
great
lump
sugar
piece
canvas
the
sugar
was
five
six
pounds
all
which
was
very
welcome
especially
the
brandy
and
sugar
which
had
had
none
left
for
many
years
when
had
carried
all
these
things
shore
the
oars
mast
sail
and
rudder
the
boat
were
carried
away
before
knocked
great
hole
her
bottom
that
they
had
come
strong
enough
master
yet
they
could
not
carry
off
the
boat
indeed
was
not
much
thoughts
that
could
able
recover
the
ship
but
view
was
that
they
went
away
without
the
boat
did
not
much
question
make
her
again
fit
carry
the
leeward
islands
and
call
upon
our
friends
the
spaniards
way
for
had
them
still
thoughts
chapter
xviii
the
ship
recovered
while
were
thus
preparing
our
designs
and
had
first
main
strength
heaved
the
boat
upon
the
beach
high
that
the
tide
would
not
float
her
off
high
water
mark
and
besides
had
broke
hole
her
bottom
too
big
quickly
stopped
and
were
set
down
musing
what
should
heard
the
ship
fire
gun
and
make
waft
with
her
ensign
signal
for
the
boat
come
board
but
boat
stirred
and
they
fired
several
times
making
other
signals
for
the
boat
last
when
all
their
signals
and
firing
proved
fruitless
and
they
found
the
boat
did
not
stir
saw
them
the
help
glasses
hoist
another
boat
out
and
row
towards
the
shore
and
found
they
approached
that
there
were
less
than
ten
men
her
and
that
they
had
firearms
with
them
the
ship
lay
almost
two
leagues
from
the
shore
had
full
view
them
they
came
and
plain
sight
even
their
faces
because
the
tide
having
set
them
little
the
east
the
other
boat
they
rowed
under
shore
come
the
same
place
where
the
other
had
landed
and
where
the
boat
lay
this
means
say
had
full
view
them
and
the
captain
knew
the
persons
and
characters
all
the
men
the
boat
whom
said
there
were
three
very
honest
fellows
who
was
sure
were
led
into
this
conspiracy
the
rest
being
over
powered
and
frightened
but
that
for
the
boatswain
who
seems
was
the
chief
officer
among
them
and
all
the
rest
they
were
outrageous
any
the
ship
crew
and
were
doubt
made
desperate
their
new
enterprise
and
terribly
apprehensive
was
that
they
would
too
powerful
for
smiled
him
and
told
him
that
men
our
circumstances
were
past
the
operation
fear
that
seeing
almost
every
condition
that
could
was
better
than
that
which
were
supposed
ought
expect
that
the
consequence
whether
death
life
would
sure
deliverance
asked
him
what
thought
the
circumstances
life
and
whether
deliverance
were
not
worth
venturing
for
and
where
sir
said
your
belief
being
preserved
here
purpose
save
your
life
which
elevated
you
little
while
ago
for
part
said
there
seems
but
one
thing
amiss
all
the
prospect
what
that
say
why
said
that
you
say
there
are
three
four
honest
fellows
among
them
which
should
spared
had
they
been
all
the
wicked
part
the
crew
should
have
thought
god
providence
had
singled
them
out
deliver
them
into
your
hands
for
depend
upon
every
man
that
comes
ashore
our
own
and
shall
die
live
they
behave
spoke
this
with
raised
voice
and
cheerful
countenance
found
greatly
encouraged
him
set
vigorously
our
business
had
upon
the
first
appearance
the
boat
coming
from
the
ship
considered
separating
our
prisoners
and
had
indeed
secured
them
effectually
two
them
whom
the
captain
was
less
assured
than
ordinary
sent
with
friday
and
one
the
three
delivered
men
cave
where
they
were
remote
enough
and
out
danger
being
heard
discovered
finding
their
way
out
the
woods
they
could
have
delivered
themselves
here
they
left
them
bound
but
gave
them
provisions
and
promised
them
they
continued
there
quietly
give
them
their
liberty
day
two
but
that
they
attempted
their
escape
they
should
put
death
without
mercy
they
promised
faithfully
bear
their
confinement
with
patience
and
were
very
thankful
that
they
had
such
good
usage
have
provisions
and
light
left
them
for
friday
gave
them
candles
such
made
ourselves
for
their
comfort
and
they
did
not
know
but
that
stood
sentinel
over
them
the
entrance
the
other
prisoners
had
better
usage
two
them
were
kept
pinioned
indeed
because
the
captain
was
not
able
trust
them
but
the
other
two
were
taken
into
service
upon
the
captain
recommendation
and
upon
their
solemnly
engaging
live
and
die
with
with
them
and
the
three
honest
men
were
seven
men
well
armed
and
made
doubt
should
able
deal
well
enough
with
the
ten
that
were
coming
considering
that
the
captain
had
said
there
were
three
four
honest
men
among
them
also
soon
they
got
the
place
where
their
other
boat
lay
they
ran
their
boat
into
the
beach
and
came
all
shore
hauling
the
boat
after
them
which
was
glad
see
for
was
afraid
they
would
rather
have
left
the
boat
anchor
some
distance
from
the
shore
with
some
hands
her
guard
her
and
should
not
able
seize
the
boat
being
shore
the
first
thing
they
did
they
ran
all
their
other
boat
and
was
easy
see
they
were
under
great
surprise
find
her
stripped
above
all
that
was
her
and
great
hole
her
bottom
after
they
had
mused
while
upon
this
they
set
two
three
great
shouts
hallooing
with
all
their
might
try
they
could
make
their
companions
hear
but
all
was
purpose
then
they
came
all
close
ring
and
fired
volley
their
small
arms
which
indeed
heard
and
the
echoes
made
the
woods
ring
but
was
all
one
those
the
cave
were
sure
could
not
hear
and
those
our
keeping
though
they
heard
well
enough
yet
durst
give
answer
them
they
were
astonished
the
surprise
this
that
they
told
afterwards
they
resolved
all
board
again
their
ship
and
let
them
know
that
the
men
were
all
murdered
and
the
long
boat
staved
accordingly
they
immediately
launched
their
boat
again
and
got
all
them
board
the
captain
was
terribly
amazed
and
even
confounded
this
believing
they
would
board
the
ship
again
and
set
sail
giving
their
comrades
over
for
lost
and
should
still
lose
the
ship
which
was
hopes
should
have
recovered
but
was
quickly
much
frightened
the
other
way
they
had
not
been
long
put
off
with
the
boat
when
perceived
them
all
coming
shore
again
but
with
this
new
measure
their
conduct
which
seems
they
consulted
together
upon
viz
leave
three
men
the
boat
and
the
rest
shore
and
into
the
country
look
for
their
fellows
this
was
great
disappointment
for
now
were
loss
what
our
seizing
those
seven
men
shore
would
advantage
let
the
boat
escape
because
they
would
row
away
the
ship
and
then
the
rest
them
would
sure
weigh
and
set
sail
and
our
recovering
the
ship
would
lost
however
had
remedy
but
wait
and
see
what
the
issue
things
might
present
the
seven
men
came
shore
and
the
three
who
remained
the
boat
put
her
off
good
distance
from
the
shore
and
came
anchor
wait
for
them
that
was
impossible
for
come
them
the
boat
those
that
came
shore
kept
close
together
marching
towards
the
top
the
little
hill
under
which
habitation
lay
and
could
see
them
plainly
though
they
could
not
perceive
should
have
been
very
glad
they
would
have
come
nearer
that
might
have
fired
them
that
they
would
have
gone
farther
off
that
might
come
abroad
but
when
they
were
come
the
brow
the
hill
where
they
could
see
great
way
into
the
valleys
and
woods
which
lay
towards
the
north
east
part
and
where
the
island
lay
lowest
they
shouted
and
hallooed
till
they
were
weary
and
not
caring
seems
venture
far
from
the
shore
nor
far
from
one
another
they
sat
down
together
under
tree
consider
had
they
thought
fit
have
gone
sleep
there
the
other
part
them
had
done
they
had
done
the
job
for
but
they
were
too
full
apprehensions
danger
venture
sleep
though
they
could
not
tell
what
the
danger
was
they
had
fear
the
captain
made
very
just
proposal
upon
this
consultation
theirs
viz
that
perhaps
they
would
all
fire
volley
again
endeavour
make
their
fellows
hear
and
that
should
all
sally
upon
them
just
the
juncture
when
their
pieces
were
all
discharged
and
they
would
certainly
yield
and
should
have
them
without
bloodshed
liked
this
proposal
provided
was
done
while
were
near
enough
come
them
before
they
could
load
their
pieces
again
but
this
event
did
not
happen
and
lay
still
long
time
very
irresolute
what
course
take
length
told
them
there
would
nothing
done
opinion
till
night
and
then
they
did
not
return
the
boat
perhaps
might
find
way
get
between
them
and
the
shore
and
might
use
some
stratagem
with
them
the
boat
get
them
shore
waited
great
while
though
very
impatient
for
their
removing
and
were
very
uneasy
when
after
long
consultation
saw
them
all
start
and
march
down
towards
the
sea
seems
they
had
such
dreadful
apprehensions
the
danger
the
place
that
they
resolved
board
the
ship
again
give
their
companions
over
for
lost
and
with
their
intended
voyage
with
the
ship
soon
perceived
them
towards
the
shore
imagined
really
was
that
they
had
given
over
their
search
and
were
going
back
again
and
the
captain
soon
told
him
thoughts
was
ready
sink
the
apprehensions
but
presently
thought
stratagem
fetch
them
back
again
and
which
answered
end
tittle
ordered
friday
and
the
captain
mate
over
the
little
creek
westward
towards
the
place
where
the
savages
came
shore
when
friday
was
rescued
and
soon
they
came
little
rising
round
about
half
mile
distant
bid
them
halloo
out
loud
they
could
and
wait
till
they
found
the
seamen
heard
them
that
soon
ever
they
heard
the
seamen
answer
them
they
should
return
again
and
then
keeping
out
sight
take
round
always
answering
when
the
others
hallooed
draw
them
far
into
the
island
and
among
the
woods
possible
and
then
wheel
about
again
such
ways
directed
them
they
were
just
going
into
the
boat
when
friday
and
the
mate
hallooed
and
they
presently
heard
them
and
answering
ran
along
the
shore
westward
towards
the
voice
they
heard
when
they
were
stopped
the
creek
where
the
water
being
they
could
not
get
over
and
called
for
the
boat
come
and
set
them
over
indeed
expected
when
they
had
set
themselves
over
observed
that
the
boat
being
gone
good
way
into
the
creek
and
were
harbour
within
the
land
they
took
one
the
three
men
out
her
along
with
them
and
left
only
two
the
boat
having
fastened
her
the
stump
little
tree
the
shore
this
was
what
wished
for
and
immediately
leaving
friday
and
the
captain
mate
their
business
took
the
rest
with
and
crossing
the
creek
out
their
sight
surprised
the
two
men
before
they
were
aware
one
them
lying
the
shore
and
the
other
being
the
boat
the
fellow
shore
was
between
sleeping
and
waking
and
going
start
the
captain
who
was
foremost
ran
upon
him
and
knocked
him
down
and
then
called
out
him
the
boat
yield
was
dead
man
they
needed
very
few
arguments
persuade
single
man
yield
when
saw
five
men
upon
him
and
his
comrade
knocked
down
besides
this
was
seems
one
the
three
who
were
not
hearty
the
mutiny
the
rest
the
crew
and
therefore
was
easily
persuaded
not
only
yield
but
afterwards
join
very
sincerely
with
the
meantime
friday
and
the
captain
mate
well
managed
their
business
with
the
rest
that
they
drew
them
hallooing
and
answering
from
one
hill
another
and
from
one
wood
another
till
they
not
only
heartily
tired
them
but
left
them
where
they
were
very
sure
they
could
not
reach
back
the
boat
before
was
dark
and
indeed
they
were
heartily
tired
themselves
also
the
time
they
came
back
had
nothing
now
but
watch
for
them
the
dark
and
fall
upon
them
make
sure
work
with
them
was
several
hours
after
friday
came
back
before
they
came
back
their
boat
and
could
hear
the
foremost
them
long
before
they
came
quite
calling
those
behind
come
along
and
could
also
hear
them
answer
and
complain
how
lame
and
tired
they
were
and
not
able
come
any
faster
which
was
very
welcome
news
length
they
came
the
boat
but
impossible
express
their
confusion
when
they
found
the
boat
fast
aground
the
creek
the
tide
ebbed
out
and
their
two
men
gone
could
hear
them
call
one
another
most
lamentable
manner
telling
one
another
they
were
got
into
enchanted
island
that
either
there
were
inhabitants
and
they
should
all
murdered
else
there
were
devils
and
spirits
and
they
should
all
carried
away
and
devoured
they
hallooed
again
and
called
their
two
comrades
their
names
great
many
times
but
answer
after
some
time
could
see
them
the
little
light
there
was
run
about
wringing
their
hands
like
men
despair
and
sometimes
they
would
and
sit
down
the
boat
rest
themselves
then
come
ashore
again
and
walk
about
again
and
the
same
thing
over
again
men
would
fain
have
had
give
them
leave
fall
upon
them
once
the
dark
but
was
willing
take
them
some
advantage
spare
them
and
kill
few
them
could
and
especially
was
unwilling
hazard
the
killing
any
our
men
knowing
the
others
were
very
well
armed
resolved
wait
see
they
did
not
separate
and
therefore
make
sure
them
drew
ambuscade
nearer
and
ordered
friday
and
the
captain
creep
upon
their
hands
and
feet
close
the
ground
they
could
that
they
might
not
discovered
and
get
near
them
they
could
possibly
before
they
offered
fire
they
had
not
been
long
that
posture
when
the
boatswain
who
was
the
principal
ringleader
the
mutiny
and
had
now
shown
himself
the
most
dejected
and
dispirited
all
the
rest
came
walking
towards
them
with
two
more
the
crew
the
captain
was
eager
having
this
principal
rogue
much
his
power
that
could
hardly
have
patience
let
him
come
near
sure
him
for
they
only
heard
his
tongue
before
but
when
they
came
nearer
the
captain
and
friday
starting
their
feet
let
fly
them
the
boatswain
was
killed
upon
the
spot
the
next
man
was
shot
the
body
and
fell
just
him
though
did
not
die
till
hour
two
after
and
the
third
ran
for
the
noise
the
fire
immediately
advanced
with
whole
army
which
was
now
eight
men
viz
myself
generalissimo
friday
lieutenant
general
the
captain
and
his
two
men
and
the
three
prisoners
war
whom
had
trusted
with
arms
came
upon
them
indeed
the
dark
that
they
could
not
see
our
number
and
made
the
man
they
had
left
the
boat
who
was
now
one
call
them
name
try
could
bring
them
parley
and
perhaps
might
reduce
them
terms
which
fell
out
just
desired
for
indeed
was
easy
think
their
condition
then
was
they
would
very
willing
capitulate
calls
out
loud
could
one
them
tom
smith
tom
smith
tom
smith
answered
immediately
that
robinson
for
seems
knew
the
voice
the
other
answered
for
god
sake
tom
smith
throw
down
your
arms
and
yield
you
are
all
dead
men
this
moment
who
must
yield
where
are
they
says
smith
again
here
they
are
says
here
our
captain
and
fifty
men
with
him
have
been
hunting
you
these
two
hours
the
boatswain
killed
will
fry
wounded
and
prisoner
and
you
not
yield
you
are
all
lost
will
they
give
quarter
then
says
tom
smith
and
will
yield
and
ask
you
promise
yield
said
robinson
asked
the
captain
and
the
captain
himself
then
calls
out
you
smith
you
know
voice
you
lay
down
your
arms
immediately
and
submit
you
shall
have
your
lives
all
but
will
atkins
upon
this
will
atkins
cried
out
for
god
sake
captain
give
quarter
what
have
done
they
have
all
been
bad
which
the
way
was
not
true
for
seems
this
will
atkins
was
the
first
man
that
laid
hold
the
captain
when
they
first
mutinied
and
used
him
barbarously
tying
his
hands
and
giving
him
injurious
language
however
the
captain
told
him
must
lay
down
his
arms
discretion
and
trust
the
governor
mercy
which
meant
for
they
all
called
governor
word
they
all
laid
down
their
arms
and
begged
their
lives
and
sent
the
man
that
had
parleyed
with
them
and
two
more
who
bound
them
all
and
then
great
army
fifty
men
which
with
those
three
were
all
but
eight
came
and
seized
upon
them
and
upon
their
boat
only
that
kept
myself
and
one
more
out
sight
for
reasons
state
our
next
work
was
repair
the
boat
and
think
seizing
the
ship
and
for
the
captain
now
had
leisure
parley
with
them
expostulated
with
them
upon
the
villainy
their
practices
with
him
and
upon
the
further
wickedness
their
design
and
how
certainly
must
bring
them
misery
and
distress
the
end
and
perhaps
the
gallows
they
all
appeared
very
penitent
and
begged
hard
for
their
lives
for
that
told
them
they
were
not
his
prisoners
but
the
commander
the
island
that
they
thought
they
had
set
him
shore
barren
uninhabited
island
but
had
pleased
god
direct
them
that
was
inhabited
and
that
the
governor
was
englishman
that
might
hang
them
all
there
pleased
but
had
given
them
all
quarter
supposed
would
send
them
england
dealt
with
there
justice
required
except
atkins
whom
was
commanded
the
governor
advise
prepare
for
death
for
that
would
hanged
the
morning
though
this
was
all
but
fiction
his
own
yet
had
its
desired

and
all
the
rest
begged
him
for
god
sake
that
they

now
occurred
that
the
time
our
deliverance
was
come
and
that
would
most
easy
thing
bring
these
fellows
hearty
getting
possession
the
ship
retired
the
dark
from
them
that
they
might
not
see
what
kind
governor
they
had
and
called
the
captain
when
called
good
distance
one
the
men
was
ordered
speak
again
and
say
the

captain
the
commander
calls
for
you
and
presently
the
captain
replied
tell

excellency
just
coming

and
they
all
believed
that

commander
was
just
with
his
fifty
men
upon
the
captain
coming
told

project
for
seizing

wonderfully
well
and
resolved

and
that

and
take

and
two
more
the
worst
them
and
send
them
pinioned
the
cave
where
the
others
lay
this
was
committed
friday
and
the
two
men
who
came
shore
with
the
captain
they
conveyed
them
the
cave
prison
and
was
indeed
dismal
place
especially
men
their
condition
the
others
ordered
bower
called
which
have
given
full
description
and
was
fenced
and
they
pinioned
the
place
was
secure
enough
considering
they
were
upon
their
behaviour
these
the

who
was
enter
into
parley
with
them
word
try
them
and
tell
whether
thought
they
might
trusted
not
board
and
surprise
the

talked
them
the
injury
done
him
the
condition
they
were
brought
and
that
though
the
governor
had
given
them
quarter
for
their
lives
the
present
action
yet
that
they
were
sent
england
they
would
all
hanged
chains
but
that
they
would
join
just
attempt
recover
the
ship
would
have
the
governor
engagement
for
their
pardon
any
one
may
guess
how
readily
such
proposal
would
accepted
men
their
condition
they
fell
down
their
knees
the
captain
and
promised
with
the
deepest
imprecations
that
they
would
faithful
him
the
last
drop
and
that
they
should
owe
their
lives
him
and
would
with
him
all
over
the
world
that
they
would
own
him
father
them
long
they
lived
well
says
the

say
and

the
temper
found

and
that
verily
believed
they
would
faithful
however
that
might
very
secure
told
him
should
back
again
and
choose
out
those
five
and
tell
them
that
they
might
see
did
not
want
men
that
would
take
out
those
five
his
assistants
and
that
the
governor
would
keep
the
other
two
and
the
three
that
were
sent
prisoners
the
castle
cave
hostages
for
the
fidelity
those
five
and
that
they
proved
unfaithful
the
execution
the
five
hostages
should
hanged
chains
alive
the
shore
this
looked
severe
and
convinced
them
that
the
governor
was
earnest
however
they
had
way
left
them
but
accept
and
was
now
the
business

the
morning
having

presently
knew
the

pointing

embraced
his
arms

and
all
that
belong

cast
eyes
the
ship
and
there
she
rode
within
little
more
than
half
mile
the
shore
for
they
had
weighed
her
anchor
soon
they
were
masters
her
and
the
weather
being
fair
had
brought
her
anchor
just
against
the
mouth
the
little
creek
and
the
tide
being
the
captain
had
brought
the
pinnace
near
the
place
where
had
first
landed
rafts
and
landed
just
door
was
first
ready
sink
down
with
the
surprise
for
saw
deliverance
indeed
visibly
put
into
hands
all
things
easy
and
large
ship
just
ready
carry
away
whither
pleased
first
for
some
time
was
not
able
answer
him
one
word
but
had
taken
his
arms
held
fast
him
should
have
fallen
the
ground
perceived
the
surprise
and
immediately
pulled
bottle
out
his
pocket
and
gave
dram
cordial
which
had
brought
purpose
for
after
had
drunk
sat
down
upon
the
ground
and
though
brought
myself
yet
was
good
while
before
could
speak
word
him
all
this
time
the
poor
man
was
great
ecstasy
only
not
under
any
surprise
was
and
said

kind
and
tender
things

and
bring
myself
but
such
was
the
flood
joy
breast
that
put
all
spirits
into
confusion

broke
out
into
tears
and
little
while
after

speech
then
took
turn
and
embraced
him
deliverer
and
rejoiced
together
told
him
looked
upon
him

that
the
whole
transaction
seemed
chain
wonders
that
such
things
these
were
the
testimonies
had
secret
hand
providence
governing
the
world
and
evidence
that
the
eye
infinite
power
could
search
into
the
remotest
corner
the
world
and
send
help
the
miserable
whenever
pleased
forgot
not
lift
heart
thankfulness
heaven
and
what
heart
could
forbear
bless
him
who
had
not
only
miraculous
manner
provided
for
such
wilderness
and
such
desolate
condition
but
from
whom
every
deliverance
must
always
acknowledged
proceed
when
had
talked
while
the
captain
told

brought
some
little
refreshment

the
ship
afforded
and
such

villainous
behaviour

and
how
they
had
run
away
with

were
preparing

further
robberies
but
that
providence
had
ensnared
them
their
own
ways
and
that
they
were
fallen
into
the
pit
which
they
had
dug
for
others
let
them
know
that

received
the
reward

villainy
and
that
they
would
see
him

nothing

but
this
that
when
they
were

very
thankful
for

left
that
issue
however
the
captain
seemed
make
some
difficulty
durst
not

upon
this
seemed
little
angry
with
the
captain
and
told
him
that

very
thankful
and
accordingly
set

they
came

some
time

with
one
piece
gratitude
indeed
which
did
not

this
was
that
the
master

had
happily
delivered

very
handsome

almost
sterling

after
making
several
reflections
upon
the
circumstances
life
and
how
little
way
this
would
towards
settling
the
world
resolved
lisbon
and
see
might
not
come
some
information
the
state
plantation
the
brazils
and
what
was
become
partner
who
had
reason
suppose
had
some
years
past
given
over
for
dead
with
this
view
took
shipping
for
lisbon
where
arrived
april
following
man
friday
accompanying
very
honestly
all
these
ramblings
and
proving
most
faithful
servant
upon
all
occasions
when
came
lisbon
found
out
inquiry
and
particular
satisfaction
old
friend
the
captain
the
ship
who
first
took
sea
off
the
shore
africa
was
now
grown
old
and
had
left
off
going
sea
having
put
his
son
who
was
far
from
young
man
into
his
ship
and
who
still
used
the
brazil
trade
the
old
man
did
not
know
and
indeed
hardly
knew
him
but
soon
brought
him
remembrance
and
soon
brought
myself
his
remembrance
when
told
him
who
was
after
some
passionate
expressions
the
old
acquaintance
between
inquired
you
may
sure
after
plantation
and
partner
the
old
man
told
had
not
been
the
brazils
for
about
nine
years
but
that
could
assure
that
when
came
away
partner
was
living
but
the
trustees
whom
had
joined
with
him
take
cognisance
part
were
both
dead
that
however
believed
would
have
very
good
account
the
improvement
the
plantation
for
that
upon
the
general
belief
being
cast
away
and
drowned
trustees
had
given
the
account
the
produce
part
the
plantation
the
procurator
fiscal
who
had
appropriated
case
never
came
claim
one
third
the
king
and
two
thirds
the
monastery
augustine
expended
for
the
benefit
the
poor
and
for
the
conversion
the
indians
the
catholic
faith
but
that
appeared
any
one
for
claim
the
inheritance
would
restored
only
that
the
improvement
annual
production
being
distributed
charitable
uses
could
not
restored
but
assured
that
the
steward
the
king
revenue
from
lands
and
the
providore
steward
the
monastery
had
taken
great
care
all
along
that
the
incumbent
that
say
partner
gave
every
year
faithful
account
the
produce
which
they
had
duly
received
moiety
asked
him
knew
what
height
improvement
had
brought
the
plantation
and
whether
thought
might
worth
looking
after
whether
going
thither
should
meet
with
any
obstruction
possessing
just
right
the
moiety
told
could
not
tell
exactly
what
degree
the
plantation
was
improved
but
this
knew
that
partner
was
grown
exceeding
rich
upon
the
enjoying
his
part
and
that
the
best
his
remembrance
had
heard
that
the
king
third
part
which
was
seems
granted
away
some
other
monastery
religious
house
amounted
above
two
hundred
moidores
year
that
being
restored
quiet
possession
there
was
question
made
that
partner
being
alive
witness
title
and
name
being
also
enrolled
the
register
the
country
also
told
that
the
survivors
two
trustees
were
very
fair
honest
people
and
very
wealthy
and
believed
would
not
only
have
their
assistance
for
putting
possession
but
would
find
very
considerable
sum
money
their
hands
for
account
being
the
produce
the
farm
while
their
fathers
held
the
trust
and
before
was
given
above
which
remembered
was
for
about
twelve
years
showed
myself
little
concerned
and
uneasy
this
account
and
inquired
the
old
captain
how
came
pass
that
the
trustees
should
thus
dispose
effects
when
knew
that
had
made
will
and
had
made
him
the
portuguese
captain
universal
heir
told
that
was
true
but
that
there
was
proof
being
dead
could
not
act
executor
until
some
certain
account
should
come
death
and
besides
was
not
willing
intermeddle
with
thing
remote
that
was
true
had
registered
will
and
put
his
claim
and
could
have
given
any
account
being
dead
alive
would
have
acted
procuration
and
taken
possession
the
ingenio
they
call
the
sugar
house
and
have
given
his
son
who
was
now
the
brazils
orders
but
says
the
old
man
have
one
piece
news
tell
you
which
perhaps
may
not
acceptable
you
the
rest
and
that
believing
you
were
lost
and
all
the
world
believing
also
your
partner
and
trustees
did
offer
account
with
your
name
for
the
first
six
eight
years
profits
which
received
there
being
that
time
great
disbursements
for
increasing
the
works
building
ingenio
and
buying
slaves
did
not
amount
near
much
afterwards
produced
however
says
the
old
man
shall
give
you
true
account
what
have
received
all
and
how
have
disposed
after
few
days
further
conference
with
this
ancient
friend
brought
account
the
first
six
years

the
merchant

being
always
delivered
goods
viz
tobacco
roll
and
sugar
chests
besides
rum
molasses
which
the
consequence
sugar
work
and
found
this
account
that
every
year
the
income
considerably
increased
but
above
the
disbursements
being
large
the
sum
first
was
small
however
the
old
man
let
see
that
was
debtor
four
hundred
and
seventy
moidores
gold
besides
sixty
chests
sugar
and
fifteen
double
rolls
tobacco
which
were
lost
his
ship
having
been
shipwrecked
coming
home
lisbon
about
eleven
years
after
having
the
place
the
good
man
then
began
complain
his
misfortunes
and
how
had
been
obliged
make
use
money
recover
his
losses
and
buy
him
share
new
ship
however
old
friend
says
you
shall
not

was
quarter
part
owner
and
his
son
another
puts
them
both
into
hands
for
security
the
rest
was
too
much
moved
with
the
honesty
and
kindness
the
poor
man
able
bear
this
and
remembering
what
had
done
for
how
had
taken
sea
and
how
generously
had
used
all
occasions
and
particularly
how
sincere
friend
was
now
could
hardly
refrain
weeping
what
had
said
therefore
asked
him
his
circumstances
admitted
him
spare
much
money
that
time
and
would
not
straiten
him
told
could
not
say
but
might
straiten
him
little
but
however
was
money
and
might
want
more
than
everything
the
good
man
said
was
full
affection
and
could
hardly
refrain
from
tears
while
spoke
short
took
one
hundred
the
moidores
and
called
for
pen
and
ink
give
him
receipt
for
them
then
returned
him

and
told
him

afterwards

that

that

never

which
scarce

how

the

was
recompense
original

good
old

who

charitable

kind

honest
the

showed
him
all
that

his

for

and
thus
requited
old
man
had
now
consider
which
way
steer
course
next
and
what
with
the
estate
that
providence
had
thus
put
into
hands
and
indeed
had
more
care
upon
head
now
than
had
state
life
the
island
where
wanted
nothing
but
what
had
and
had
nothing

whereas

and
tarnished
before
anybody

not
where
put

the

indeed
was
honest
and
that
was
the
only
refuge
had
the
next
place
interest
the
brazils
seemed
summon
thither
but
now
could
not
tell
how
think
going
thither
till
had
settled
affairs
and
left
effects
some
safe
hands
behind
first
thought
old
friend
the
widow
who
knew
was
honest
and
would
just
but
then
she
was
years
and
but
poor
and
for
aught
knew
might
debt
that
word
had
way
but
back
england
myself
and
take
effects
with
was
some
months
however
before
resolved
upon
this
and
therefore
had
rewarded
the
old
captain
fully
and
his
satisfaction
who
had
been
former
benefactor
began
think
the
poor
widow
whose
husband
had
been
first
benefactor
and
she
while
was
her
power
faithful
steward
and
instructor
the
first
thing
did
got
merchant
lisbon
write
his
correspondent
london
not
only
pay

but
find
her
out
and
carry
her
money
hundred
pounds
from
and
talk
with
her
and
comfort
her
her
poverty
telling
her
she
should
lived
have
further
supply
the
same
time
sent
two
sisters
the
country
hundred
pounds
each
they
being
though
not
want
yet
not
very
good
circumstances
one
having
been
married
and
left
widow
and
the
other
having
husband
not
kind
her
should
but
among
all
relations
acquaintances
could
not
yet
pitch
upon
one
whom
durst
commit
the
gross
stock
that
might
away
the
brazils
and
leave
things
safe
behind
and
this
greatly
perplexed
had
once
mind
have
gone
the
brazils
and
have
settled
myself
there
for
was
were
naturalised
the
place
but
had
some
little
scruple
mind
about
religion
which
insensibly
drew
back
however
was
not
religion
that
kept
from
going
there
for
the
present
and
had
made
scruple
being
openly
the
religion
the
country
all
the
while
was
among
them
neither
did
yet
only
that
now
and
then
having
late
thought
more
than
formerly
when
began
think
living
and
dying
among
them
began
regret
having
professed
myself
papist
and
thought
might
not
the
best
religion
die
with
but
have
said
this
was
not
the
main
thing
that
kept
from
going
the
brazils
but
that
really
did
not
know
with
whom
leave
effects
behind
resolved
last
england
where
arrived
concluded
that
should
make
some
acquaintance
find
some
relations
that
would
faithful
and
accordingly
prepared
england
with
all
wealth
order
prepare
things
for
going
home
first
the
brazil
fleet
being
just
going
away
resolved
give
answers
suitable
the
just
and
faithful
account
things
had
from
thence
and
first
the
prior
augustine
wrote
letter
full
thanks
for
his
just
dealings
and
the
offer
the
eight
hundred
and
seventy
two
moidores
which
were
undisposed
which
desired
might
given
five
hundred
the
monastery
and
three
hundred
and
seventy
two
the
poor
the
prior
should
direct
desiring
the
good
padre
prayers
for
and
the
like
wrote
next
letter
thanks
two
trustees
with
all
the
acknowledgment
that
much
justice
and
honesty
called
for
for
sending
them
any
present
they
were
far
above
having
any
occasion
lastly
wrote
partner
acknowledging
his
industry
the
improving
the
plantation
and
his
integrity
increasing
the
stock
the
works
giving
him
instructions
for
his
future
government
part
according
the
powers
had
left
with
old
patron
whom
desired
him
send
whatever
became
due
till
should
hear
from
more
particularly
assuring
him
that
was
intention
not
only
come
him
but
settle
myself
there
for
the
remainder
life
this
added
very
handsome
present
some
italian
silks
for
his
wife
and
two
daughters
for
such
the
captain
son
informed
had
with
two
pieces
fine
english
broadcloth
the
best
could
get
lisbon
five
pieces
black
baize
and
some
flanders
lace
good
value
having
thus
settled
affairs
sold
cargo
and
turned
all
effects
into
good
bills
exchange
next
difficulty
was
which
way
england
had
been
accustomed
enough
the
sea
and
yet
had
strange
aversion
england
the
sea
that
time
and
yet
could
give
reason
for
yet
the
difficulty
increased
upon
much
that
though
had
once
shipped
baggage
order
yet
altered
mind
and
that
not
once
but
two
three
times
true
had
been
very
unfortunate
sea
and
this
might
one
the
reasons
but
let
man
slight
the
strong
impulses
his
own
thoughts
cases
such
moment
two
the
ships
which
had
singled
out
mean
more
particularly
singled
out
than
any
other
having
put
things
board
one
them
and
the
other
having
agreed
with
the
captain
say
two
these
ships
miscarried
one
was
taken
the
algerines
and
the
other
was
lost
the
start
near
torbay
and
all
the
people
drowned
except
three
that
either
those
vessels
had
been
made
miserable
having
been
thus
harassed
thoughts
old
pilot
whom
communicated
everything
pressed
earnestly
not
sea
but
either

the
groyne
and
cross
over
the

but
easy
and
safe

and
all
the

word
was
prepossessed
against
going

all
except
from
calais
dover
that
resolved
travel
all
the
way
land
which
was
not
haste
and
did
not
value
the
charge
was
much
the
pleasanter
way
and
make
more
old
captain
brought
english
gentleman
the
son
merchant
lisbon
who
was
willing
travel
with
after
which
picked
two
more
english
merchants
also
and
two
young
portuguese
gentlemen
the
last
going
paris
only
that
all
there
were
six
and
five
servants
the
two
merchants
and
the
two
portuguese
contenting
themselves
with
one
servant
between
two

the

got

besides
man
friday
who
was
too
much
stranger
capable
supplying
the
place
servant
the
road
this
manner
set
out
from
lisbon
and
our
company
being
very
well
mounted
and
armed
made
little
troop
whereof
they
did
the
honour
call
captain
well
because
was
the
oldest
man
because
had
two
servants
and
indeed
was
the
origin
the
whole
journey
have
troubled
you
with
none
sea
journals
shall
trouble
you
now
with
none
land
journals
but
some
adventures
that
happened
this
tedious
and
difficult
journey
must
not
omit
when
came
madrid
being
all
strangers
spain
were
willing
stay
some
time
see
the
court
spain
and
what
was
worth
observing
but
being
the
latter
part
the
summer
hastened
away
and
set
out
from
madrid
about
the
middle
october
but
when
came
the
edge
navarre
were
alarmed
several
towns
the
way
with
account
that
much
snow
was
falling
the
french
side
the
mountains
that
several
travellers
were
obliged
come
back
pampeluna
after
having
attempted
extreme
hazard
pass
when
came
pampeluna
itself
found
indeed
and
that
had
been
always
used
hot
climate
and
countries
where
could
scarce
bear
any
clothes
the
cold
was
insufferable
nor
indeed
was
more
painful
than
surprising
come
but
ten
days
before
out
old
castile
where
the
weather
was
not
only
warm
but
very
hot
and
immediately
feel
wind
from
the
pyrenean
mountains
very
keen
severely
cold
intolerable
and
endanger
benumbing
and
perishing
our
fingers
and
toes
poor
friday
was
really
frightened
when
saw
the
mountains
all
covered
with
snow
and
felt
cold
weather
which
had
never
seen
felt
before
his
life
mend
the
matter
when
came
pampeluna
continued
snowing
with
much
violence
and
long
that
the
people
said
winter
was
come
before
its
time
and
the
roads
which
were
difficult
before
were
now
quite
impassable
for
word
the
snow
lay
some
places
too
thick
for
travel
and
being
not
hard
frozen
the
case
the
northern
countries
there
was
going
without
being
danger
being
buried
alive
every
step
stayed
less
than
twenty
days
pampeluna
when
seeing
the
winter
coming
and
likelihood
its
being
better
for
was
the
severest
winter
all
over
europe
that
had
been
known
the
memory
man
proposed
that
should
away
fontarabia
and
there
take
shipping
for
bordeaux
which
was
very
little
voyage
but
while
was
considering
this
there
came
four
french
gentlemen
who
having
been
stopped
the
french
side
the
passes
were
the
spanish
had
found
out
guide
who
traversing
the
country
near
the
head
languedoc
had
brought
them
over
the
mountains
such
ways
that
they
were
not
much
incommoded
with
the
snow
for
where
they
met
with
snow
any
quantity
they
said
was
frozen
hard
enough
bear
them
and
their
horses
sent
for
this
guide
who
told
would
undertake
carry
the
same
way
with
hazard
from
the
snow
provided
were
armed
sufficiently
protect
ourselves
from
wild
beasts
for
said
these
great
snows
was
frequent
for
some
wolves
show
themselves
the
foot
the
mountains
being
made
ravenous
for
want
food
the
ground
being
covered
with
snow
told
him
were
well
enough
prepared
for
such
creatures
they
were
would
insure
from
kind
two
legged
wolves
which
were
told
were
most
danger
from
especially
the
french
side
the
mountains
satisfied
that
there
was
danger
that
kind
the
way
that
were
readily
agreed
follow
him
did
also
twelve
other
gentlemen
with
their
servants
some
french
some
spanish
who
said
had
attempted
and
were
obliged
come
back
again
accordingly
set
out
from
pampeluna
with
our
guide
the
november
and
indeed
was
surprised
when
instead
going
forward
came
directly
back
with
the
same
road
that
came
from
madrid
about
twenty
miles
when
having
passed
two
rivers
and
come
into
the
plain
country
found
ourselves
warm
climate
again
where
the
country
was
pleasant
and
snow
seen
but
sudden
turning
his
left
approached
the
mountains
another
way
and
though
true
the
hills
and
precipices
looked
dreadful
yet
made
many
tours
such
meanders
and
led
such
winding
ways
that
insensibly
passed
the
height
the
mountains
without
being
much
encumbered
with
the
snow
and
all
sudden
showed
the
pleasant
and
fruitful
provinces
languedoc
and
gascony
all
green
and
flourishing
though
great
distance
and
had
some
rough
way
pass
still
were
little
uneasy
however
when
found
snowed
one
whole
day
and
night
fast
that
could
not
travel
but
bid
easy
should
soon
past
all
found
indeed
that
began
descend
every
day
and
come
more
north
than
before
and
depending
upon
our
guide
went
was
about
two
hours
before
night
when
our
guide
being
something
before
and
not
just
sight
out
rushed
three
monstrous
wolves
and
after
them
bear
from
hollow
way
adjoining
thick
wood
two
the
wolves
made
the
guide
and
had
been
far
before
would
have
been
devoured
before
could
have
helped
him
one
them
fastened
upon
his
horse
and
the
other
attacked
the
man
with
such
violence
that
had
not
time
presence
mind
enough
draw
his
pistol
but
hallooed
and
cried
out
most
lustily
man
friday
being
next
bade
him
ride
and
see
what
was
the
matter
soon
friday
came
sight
the
man
hallooed
out
loud
the
other
master
master
but
like
bold
fellow
rode
directly
the
poor
man
and
with
his
pistol
shot
the
wolf
the
head
that
attacked
him
was
happy
for
the
poor
man
that
was
man
friday
for
having
been
used
such
creatures
his
country
had
fear
upon
him
but
went
close
him
and
shot
him
whereas
any
other
would
have
fired
farther
distance
and
have
perhaps
either
missed
the
wolf
endangered
shooting
the
man
but
was
enough
have
terrified
bolder
man
than
and
indeed
alarmed
all
our
company
when
with
the
noise
friday
pistol
heard
both
sides
the
most
dismal
howling
wolves
and
the
noise
redoubled
the
echo
the
mountains
appeared
there
had
been
prodigious
number
them
and
perhaps
there
was
not
such
few
that
had
cause
apprehension
however
friday
had
killed
this
wolf
the
other
that
had
fastened
upon
the
horse
left
him
immediately
and
fled
without
doing
him
any
damage
having
happily
fastened
upon
his
head
where
the
bosses
the
bridle
had
stuck
his
teeth
but
the
man
was
most
hurt
for
the
raging
creature
had
bit
him
twice
once
the
arm
and
the
other
time
little
above
his
knee
and
though
had
made
some
defence
was
just
tumbling
down
the
disorder
his
horse
when
friday
came
and
shot
the
wolf
easy
suppose
that
the
noise
friday
pistol
all
mended
our
pace
and
rode
fast
the
way
which
was
very
difficult
would
give
leave
see
what
was
the
matter
soon
came
clear
the
trees
which
blinded
before
saw
clearly
what
had
been
the
case
and
how
friday
had
disengaged
the
poor
guide
though
did
not
presently
discern
what
kind
creature
was
had
killed
chapter
fight
between
friday
and
bear
but
never
was
fight
managed
hardily
and
such
surprising
manner
that
which
followed
between
friday
and
the
bear
which
gave
all
though
first
were
surprised
and
afraid
for
him
the
greatest
diversion
imaginable
the
bear
heavy
clumsy
creature
and
does
not
gallop
the
wolf
does
who
swift
and
light
has
two
particular
qualities
which
generally
are
the
rule
his
actions
first
men
who
are
not
his
proper
prey
does
not
usually
attempt
them
except
they
first
attack
him
unless
excessively
hungry
which
probable
might
now
the
case
the
ground
being
covered
with
snow
you
not
meddle
with
him
will
not
meddle
with
you
but
then
you
must
take
care
very
civil
him
and
give
him
the
road
for
very
nice
gentleman
will
not
step
out
his
way
for
prince
nay
you
are
really
afraid
your
best
way
look
another
way
and
keep
going
for
sometimes
you
stop
and
stand
still
and
look
steadfastly
him
takes
for
affront
but
you
throw
toss
anything
him
though
were
but
bit
stick
big
your
finger
thinks
himself
abused
and
sets
all
other
business
aside
pursue
his
revenge
and
will
have
satisfaction
point
honour
that
his
first
quality
the
next
once
affronted
will
never
leave
you
night
day
till
has
his
revenge
but
follows
good
round
rate
till
overtakes
you
man
friday
had
delivered
our
guide
and
when
came
him
was
helping
him
off
his
horse
for
the
man
was
both
hurt
and
frightened
when
sudden
espied
the
bear
come
out
the
wood
and
monstrous
one
was
the
biggest
far
that
ever
saw
were
all
little
surprised
when
saw
him
but
when
friday
saw
him
was
easy
see
joy
and
courage
the
fellow
countenance
says
friday
three
times
pointing
him
master
you
give
leave
shakee
hand
with
him
makee
you
good
laugh
was
surprised
see
the
fellow
well
pleased
you
fool
says

eat
you
eatee
eatee
says
friday
twice
over
again
eatee
him
makee
you
good
laugh

all
stay
here
show
you
good
laugh
down
sits
and
gets
off
his
boots
moment
and
puts
pair
pumps
call
the
flat
shoes
they
wear
and
which
had
his
pocket
gives
other
servant
his
horse
and
with
his
gun
away
flew
swift
like
the
wind
the
bear
was
walking
softly
and
offered
meddle
with
nobody
till
friday
coming
pretty
near
calls
him
the
bear
could
understand
him
hark
hark
says
friday
speakee
with
you
followed
distance
for
now
being
down
the
gascony
side
the
mountains
were
entered
vast
forest
where
the
country
was
plain
and
pretty
open
though
had
many
trees
scattered
here
and
there
friday
who
had
say
the
heels
the
bear
came
with
him
quickly
and
took
great
stone
and
threw
him
and
hit
him
just
the
head
but
did
him
more
harm
than
had
thrown
against
wall
but
answered
friday
end
for
the
rogue
was
void
fear
that
did
purely
make
the
bear
follow
him
and
show
some
laugh
called
soon
the
bear
felt
the
blow
and
saw
him
turns
about
and
comes
after
him
taking
very
long
strides
and
shuffling
strange
rate
would
have
put
horse
middling
gallop
away
reins
friday
and
takes
his
course
ran
towards
for
help
all
resolved
fire
once
upon
the
bear
and
deliver
man
though
was
angry
him
for
bringing
the
bear
back
upon
when
was
going
about
his
own
business
another
way
and
especially
was
angry
that
had
turned
the
bear
upon
and
then
ran
away
and
called
out
you
dog
this
your
making
laugh
come
away
and
take
your
horse
that
may
shoot
the
creature
heard
and
cried
out
shoot
shoot
stand
still
and
you
get
much
laugh
and
the
nimble
creature
ran
two
feet
for
the
bear
one
turned
sudden
one
side
and
seeing
great
oak
tree
fit
for
his
purpose
beckoned
follow
and
doubling
his
pace
got
nimbly
the
tree
laying
his
gun
down
upon
the
ground
about
five
six
yards
from
the
bottom
the
tree
the
bear
soon
came
the
tree
and
followed
distance
the
first
thing
did
stopped
the
gun
smelt
but
let
lie
and
scrambles
into
the
tree
climbing
like
cat
though
monstrous
heavy
was
amazed
the
folly
thought
man
and
could
not
for
life
see
anything
laugh
till
seeing
the
bear
get
the
tree
all
rode
near
him
when
came
the
tree
there
was
friday
got
out
the
small
end
large
branch
and
the
bear
got
about
half
way
him
soon
the
bear
got
out
that
part
where
the
limb
the
tree
was
weaker
says
now
you
see
teachee
the
bear
dance
began
jumping
and
shaking
the
bough
which
the
bear
began
totter
but
stood
still
and
began
look
behind
him
see
how
should
get
back
then
indeed
did
laugh
heartily
but
friday
had
not
done
with
him
great
deal
when
seeing
him
stand
still
called
out
him
again
had
supposed
the
bear
could
speak
english
what
you
come
farther
pray
you
come
farther
left
jumping
and
shaking
the
tree
and
the
bear
just
understood
what
said
did
come
little
farther
then
began
jumping
again
and
the
bear
stopped
again
thought
now
was
good
time
knock
him
the
head
and
called
friday
stand
still
and
should
shoot
the
bear
but
cried
out
earnestly
pray
pray
shoot
shoot
and
then
would
have
said
and
however
shorten
the
story
friday
danced
much
and
the
bear
stood
ticklish
that
had
laughing
enough
but
still
could
not
imagine
what
the
fellow
would
for
first
thought
depended
upon
shaking
the
bear
off
and
found
the
bear
was
too
cunning
for
that
too
for
would
not
out
far
enough
thrown
down
but
clung
fast
with
his
great
broad
claws
and
feet
that
could
not
imagine
what
would
the
end
and
what
the
jest
would
last
but
friday
put
out
doubt
quickly
for
seeing
the
bear
cling
fast
the
bough
and
that
would
not
persuaded
come
any
farther
well
well
says
friday
you
come
farther
you
come
come
you
and
upon
this
went
out
the
smaller
end
where
would
bend
with
his
weight
and
gently
let
himself
down
sliding
down
the
bough
till
came
near
enough
jump
down
his
feet
and
away
ran
his
gun
took
and
stood
still
well
said
him
friday
what
will
you
now
why
don
you
shoot
him
shoot
says
friday
yet
shoot
now
kill
stay
give
you
one
more
laugh
and
indeed
did
for
when
the
bear
saw
his
enemy
gone
came
back
from
the
bough
where
stood
but
did
very
cautiously
looking
behind
him
every
step
and
coming
backward
till
got
into
the
body
the
tree
then
with
the
same
hinder
end
foremost
came
down
the
tree
grasping
with
his
claws
and
moving
one
foot
time
very
leisurely
this
juncture
and
just
before
could
set
his
hind
foot
the
ground
friday
stepped
close
him
clapped
the
muzzle
his
piece
into
his
ear
and
shot
him
dead
then
the
rogue
turned
about
see
did
not
laugh
and
when
saw
were
pleased
our
looks
began
laugh
very
loud
kill
bear
country
says
friday
you
kill
them
says
why
you
have
guns
says
gun
but
shoot
great
much
long
arrow
this
was
good
diversion
but
were
still
wild
place
and
our
guide
very
much
hurt
and
what
hardly
knew
the
howling
wolves
ran
much
head
and
indeed
except
the
noise
once
heard
the
shore
africa
which
have
said
something
already
never
heard
anything
that
filled
with
much
horror
these
things
and
the
approach
night
called
off
else
friday
would
have
had
should
certainly
have
taken
the
skin
this
monstrous
creature
off
which
was
worth
saving
but
had
near
three
leagues
and
our
guide
hastened
left
him
and
went
forward
our
journey
the
ground
was
still
covered
with
snow
though
not
deep
and
dangerous
the
mountains
and
the
ravenous
creatures
heard
afterwards
were
come
down
into
the
forest
and
plain
country
pressed
hunger
seek
for
food
and
had
done
great
deal
mischief
the
villages
where
they
surprised
the
country
people
killed
great
many
their
sheep
and
horses
and
some
people
too
had
one
dangerous
place
pass
and
our
guide
told
there
were
more
wolves
the
country
should
find
them
there
and
this
was
small
plain
surrounded
with
woods
every
side
and
long
narrow
defile
lane
which
were
pass
get
through
the
wood
and
then
should
come
the
village
where
were
lodge
was
within
half
hour
sunset
when
entered
the
wood
and
little
after
sunset
when
came
into
the
plain
met
with
nothing
the
first
wood
except
that
little
plain
within
the
wood
which
was
not
above
two
furlongs
over
saw
five
great
wolves
cross
the
road
full
speed
one
after
another
they
had
been
chase
some
prey
and
had
view
they
took
notice
and
were
gone
out
sight
few
moments
upon
this
our
guide
who
the
way
was
but
fainthearted
fellow
bid
keep
ready
posture
for
believed
there
were
more
wolves
coming
kept
our
arms
ready
and
our
eyes
about
but
saw
more
wolves
till
came
through
that
wood
which
was
near
half
league
and
entered
the
plain
soon
came
into
the
plain
had
occasion
enough
look
about
the
first
object
met
with
was
dead
horse
that
say
poor
horse
which
the
wolves
had
killed
and
least
dozen
them
work
could
not
say
eating
him
but
picking
his
bones
rather
for
they
had
eaten
all
the
flesh
before
did
not
think
fit
disturb
them
their
feast
neither
did
they
take
much
notice
friday
would
have
let
fly
them
but
would
not
suffer
him
any
means
for
found
were
like
have
more
business
upon
our
hands
than
were
aware
had
not
gone
half
over
the
plain
when
began
hear
the
wolves
howl
the
wood
our
left
frightful
manner
and
presently
after
saw
about
hundred
coming
directly
towards
all
body
and
most
them
line
regularly
army
drawn
experienced
officers
scarce
knew
what
manner
receive
them
but
found
draw
ourselves
close
line
was
the
only
way
formed
moment
but
that
might
not
have
too
much
interval
ordered
that
only
every
other
man
should
fire
and
that
the
others
who
had
not
fired
should
stand
ready
give
them
second
volley
immediately
they
continued
advance
upon
and
then
that
those
that
had
fired
first
should
not
pretend
load
their
fusees
again
but
stand
ready
every
one
with
pistol
for
were
all
armed
with
fusee
and
pair
pistols
each
man
were
this
method
able
fire
six
volleys
half
time
however
present
had
necessity
for
upon
firing
the
first
volley
the
enemy
made
full
stop
being
terrified
well
with
the
noise
with
the
fire
four
them
being
shot
the
head
dropped
several
others
were
wounded
and
went
bleeding
off
could
see
the
snow
found
they
stopped
but
did
not
immediately
retreat
whereupon
remembering
that
had
been
told
that
the
fiercest
creatures
were
terrified
the
voice
man
caused
all
the
company
halloo
loud
they
could
and
found
the
notion
not
altogether
mistaken
for
upon
our
shout
they
began
retire
and
turn
about
then
ordered
second
volley
fired
their
rear
which
put
them
the
gallop
and
away
they
went
the
woods
this
gave
leisure
charge
our
pieces
again
and
that
might
lose
time
kept
going
but
had
but
little
more
than
loaded
our
fusees
and
put
ourselves
readiness
when
heard
terrible
noise
the
same
wood
our
left
only
that
was
farther
onward
the
same
way
were
the
night
was
coming
and
the
light
began
dusky
which
made
worse
our
side
but
the
noise
increasing
could
easily
perceive
that
was
the
howling
and
yelling
those
hellish
creatures
and
sudden
perceived
three
troops
wolves
one
our
left
one
behind
and
one
our
front
that
seemed
surrounded
with
them
however
they
did
not
fall
upon
kept
our
way
forward
fast
could
make
our
horses
which
the
way
being
very
rough
was
only
good
hard
trot
this
manner
came
view
the
entrance
wood
through
which
were
pass
the
farther
side
the
plain
but
were
greatly
surprised
when
coming
nearer
the
lane
pass
saw
confused
number
wolves
standing
just
the
entrance
sudden
another
opening
the
wood
heard
the
noise
gun
and
looking
that
way
out
rushed
horse
with
saddle
and
bridle
him
flying
like
the
wind
and
sixteen
seventeen
wolves
after
him
full
speed
the
horse
had
the
advantage
them
but
supposed
that
could
not
hold
that
rate
doubted
not
but
they
would
get
with
him
last
question
but
they
did
but
here
had
most
horrible
sight
for
riding
the
entrance
where
the
horse
came
out
found
the
carcasses
another
horse
and
two
men
devoured
the
ravenous
creatures
and
one
the
men
was
doubt
the
same
whom
heard
fire
the
gun
for
there
lay
gun
just
him
fired
off
but
the
man
his
head
and
the
upper
part
his
body
was
eaten
this
filled
with
horror
and
knew
not
what
course
take
but
the
creatures
resolved
soon
for
they
gathered
about
presently
hopes
prey
and
verily
believe
there
were
three
hundred
them
happened
very
much
our
advantage
that
the
entrance
into
the
wood
but
little
way
from
there
lay
some
large
timber
trees
which
had
been
cut
down
the
summer
before
and
suppose
lay
there
for
carriage
drew
little
troop
among
those
trees
and
placing
ourselves
line
behind
one
long
tree
advised
them
all
alight
and
keeping
that
tree
before
for
breastwork
stand
triangle
three
fronts
enclosing
our
horses
the
centre
did
and
was
well
did
for
never
was
more
furious
charge
than
the
creatures
made
upon
this
place
they
came
with
growling
kind
noise
and
mounted
the
piece
timber
which
said
was
our
breastwork
they
were
only
rushing
upon
their
prey
and
this
fury
theirs
seems
was
principally
occasioned
their
seeing
our
horses
behind
ordered
our
men
fire
before
every
other
man
and
they
took
their
aim
sure
that
they
killed
several
the
wolves
the
first
volley
but
there
was
necessity
keep
continual
firing
for
they
came
like
devils
those
behind
pushing
those
before
when
had
fired
second
volley
our
fusees
thought
they
stopped
little
and
hoped
they
would
have
gone
off
but
was
but
moment
for
others
came
forward
again
fired
two
volleys
our
pistols
and
believe
these
four
firings
had
killed
seventeen
eighteen
them
and
lamed
twice
many
yet
they
came
again
was
loth
spend
our
shot
too
hastily
called
servant
not
man
friday
for
was
better
employed
for
with
the
greatest
dexterity
imaginable
had
charged
fusee
and
his
own
while
were
engaged
but
said
called
other
man
and
giving
him
horn
powder
had
him
lay
train
all
along
the
piece
timber
and
let
large
train
did
and
had
but
just
time
get
away
when
the
wolves
came
and
some
got
upon
when
snapping
unchanged
pistol
close
the
powder
set
fire
those
that
were
upon
the
timber
were
scorched
with
and
six
seven
them
fell
rather
jumped
among
with
the
force
and
fright
the
fire
despatched
these
instant
and
the
rest
were
frightened
with
the
light
which
the
night
for
was
now
very
near
dark
made
more
terrible
that
they
drew
back
little
upon
which
ordered
our
last
pistols
fired
off
one
volley
and
after
that
gave
shout
upon
this
the
wolves
turned
tail
and
sallied
immediately
upon
near
twenty
lame
ones
that
found
struggling
the
ground
and
fell
cutting
them
with
our
swords
which
answered
our
expectation
for
the
crying
and
howling
they
made
was
better
understood
their
fellows
that
they
all
fled
and
left
had
first
and
last
killed
about
threescore
them
and
had
been
daylight
had
killed
many
more
the
field
battle
being
thus
cleared
made
forward
again
for
had
still
near
league
heard
the
ravenous
creatures
howl
and
yell
the
woods
went
several
times
and
sometimes
fancied
saw
some
them
but
the
snow
dazzling
our
eyes
were
not
certain
about
hour
more
came
the
town
where
were
lodge
which
found
terrible
fright
and
all
arms
for
seems
the
night
before
the
wolves
and
some
bears
had
broken
into
the
village
and
put
them
such
terror
that
they
were
obliged
keep
guard
night
and
day
but
especially
the
night
preserve
their
cattle
and
indeed
their
people
the
next
morning
our
guide
was
ill
and
his
limbs
swelled
much
with
the
rankling
his
two
wounds
that
could
farther
were
obliged
take
new
guide
here
and
toulouse
where
found
warm
climate
fruitful
pleasant
country
and
snow
wolves
nor
anything
like
them
but
when
told
our
story
toulouse
they
told
was
nothing
but
what
was
ordinary
the
great
forest
the
foot
the
mountains
especially
when
the
snow
lay
the
ground
but
they
inquired
much
what
kind
guide
had
got
who
would
venture
bring
that
way
such
severe
season
and
told
was
surprising
were
not
all
devoured
when
told
them
how
placed
ourselves
and
the
horses
the
middle
they
blamed
exceedingly
and
told
was
fifty
one
but
had
been
all
destroyed
for
was
the
sight
the
horses
which
made
the
wolves
furious
seeing
their
prey
and
that
other
times
they
are
really
afraid
gun
but
being
excessively
hungry
and
raging
that
account
the
eagerness
come
the
horses
had
made
them
senseless
danger
and
that
had
not
the
continual
fire
and
last
the
stratagem
the
train
powder
mastered
them
had
been
great
odds
but
that
had
been
torn
pieces
whereas
had
been
content
have
sat
still
horseback
and
fired
horsemen
they
would
not
have
taken
the
horses
much
for
their
own
when
men
were
their
backs
otherwise
and
withal
they
told
that
last
had
stood
altogether
and
left
our
horses
they
would
have
been
eager
have
devoured
them
that
might
have
come
off
safe
especially
having
our
firearms
our
hands
being
many
number
for
part
was
never
sensible
danger
life
for
seeing
above
three
hundred
devils
come
roaring
and
open
mouthed
devour
and
having
nothing
shelter
retreat
gave
myself
over
for
lost
and
was
believe
shall
never
care
cross
those
mountains
again
think
would
much
rather
thousand
leagues
sea
though
was
sure
meet
with
storm
once

have
nothing
uncommon
take
notice
passage
through

nothing
but
what
other
travellers
have
given
account
with
much
more
advantage
than
can
travelled
from
toulouse
paris
and
without
any
considerable
stay
came

landed
