arriving
vienna
early
next
morning
should
have
arrived
but
train
was
hour
late
buda
pesth
seems
wonderful
place
from
the
glimpse
which
got
from
the
train
and
the
little
could
walk
through
the
streets
feared
very
far
from
the
station
had
arrived
late
and
would
start
near
the
correct
time
possible
the
impression
had
was
that
were
leaving
the
west
and
entering
the
east
the
most
western
splendid
bridges
over
the
danube
which
here
noble
width
and
depth
took
among
the
traditions
turkish
rule
left
pretty
good
time
and
came
after
nightfall
klausenburgh
here
stopped
for
the
night
the
hotel
royale
had
for
dinner
rather
supper
chicken
done
some
way
with
red
pepper
which
was
very
good
but
thirsty
mem
get
recipe
for
mina
asked
the
waiter
and
said
was
called
paprika
hendl
and
that
was
national
dish
should
able
get
anywhere
along
the
carpathians
found
smattering
german
very
useful
here
indeed
don
know
how
should
able
get
without
having
had
some
time
disposal
when
london
had
visited
the
british
museum
and
made
search
among
the
books
and
maps
the
library
regarding
transylvania
had
struck
that
some
foreknowledge
the
country
could
hardly
fail
have
some
importance
dealing
with
nobleman
that
country
find
that
the
district
named
the
extreme
east
the
country
just
the
borders
three
states
transylvania
moldavia
and
bukovina
the
midst
the
carpathian
mountains
one
the
wildest
and
least
known
portions
europe
was
not
able
light
any
map
work
giving
the
exact
locality
the
castle
dracula
there
are
maps
this
country
yet
compare
with
our
own
ordnance
survey
maps
but
found
that
bistritz
the
post
town
named
count
dracula
fairly
well
known
place
shall
enter
here
some
notes
they
may
refresh
memory
when
talk
over
travels
with
mina
the
population
transylvania
there
are
four
distinct
nationalities
saxons
the
south
and
mixed
with
them
the
wallachs
who
are
the
descendants
the
dacians
magyars
the
west
and
szekelys
the
east
and
north
going
among
the
latter
who
claim
descended
from
attila
and
the
huns
this
may
for
when
the
magyars
conquered
the
country
the
eleventh
century
they
found
the
huns
settled
read
that
every
known
superstition
the
world
gathered
into
the
horseshoe
the
carpathians
were
the
centre
some
sort
imaginative
whirlpool
stay
may
very
interesting
mem
must
ask
the
count
all
about
them
did
not
sleep
well
though
bed
was
comfortable
enough
for
had
all
sorts
queer
dreams
there
was
dog
howling
all
night
under
window
which
may
have
had
something
with
may
have
been
the
paprika
for
had
drink
all
the
water
carafe
and
was
still
thirsty
towards
morning
slept
and
was
wakened
the
continuous
knocking
door
guess
must
have
been
sleeping
soundly
then
had
for
breakfast
more
paprika
and
sort
porridge
maize
flour
which
they
said
was
mamaliga
and
egg
plant
stuffed
with
forcemeat
very
excellent
dish
which
they
call
impletata
mem
get
recipe
for
this
also
had
hurry
breakfast
for
the
train
started
little
before
eight
rather
ought
have
done
for
after
rushing
the
station
had
sit
the
carriage
for
more
than
hour
before
began
move
seems
that
the
further
east
you
the
more
unpunctual
are
the
trains
what
ought
they
china
all
day
long
seemed
dawdle
through
country
which
was
full
beauty
every
kind
sometimes
saw
little
towns
castles
the
top
steep
hills
such
see
old
missals
sometimes
ran
rivers
and
streams
which
seemed
from
the
wide
stony
margin
each
side
them
subject
great
floods
takes
lot
water
and
running
strong
sweep
the
outside
edge
river
clear
every
station
there
were
groups
people
sometimes
crowds
and
all
sorts
attire
some
them
were
just
like
the
peasants
home
those
saw
coming
through
france
and
germany
with
short
jackets
and
round
hats
and
home
made
trousers
but
others
were
very
picturesque
the
women
looked
pretty
except
when
you
got
near
them
but
they
were
very
clumsy
about
the
waist
they
had
all
full
white
sleeves
some
kind
other
and
most
them
had
big
belts
with
lot
strips
something
fluttering
from
them
like
the
dresses
ballet
but
course
there
were
petticoats
under
them
the
strangest
figures
saw
were
the
slovaks
who
were
more
barbarian
than
the
rest
with
their
big
cow
boy
hats
great
baggy
dirty
white
trousers
white
linen
shirts
and
enormous
heavy
leather
belts
nearly
foot
wide
all
studded
over
with
brass
nails
they
wore
high
boots
with
their
trousers
tucked
into
them
and
had
long
black
hair
and
heavy
black
moustaches
they
are
very
picturesque
but
not
look
prepossessing
the
stage
they
would
set
down
once
some
old
oriental
band
brigands
they
are
however
told
very
harmless
and
rather
wanting
natural
self
assertion
was
the
dark
side
twilight
when
got
bistritz
which
very
interesting
old
place
being
practically
the
frontier
for
the
borgo
pass
leads
from
into
bukovina
has
had
very
stormy
existence
and
certainly
shows
marks
fifty
years
ago
series
great
fires
took
place
which
made
terrible
havoc
five
separate
occasions
the
very
beginning
the
seventeenth
century
underwent
siege
three
weeks
and
lost
people
the
casualties
war
proper
being
assisted
famine
and
disease
count
dracula
had
directed
the
golden
krone
hotel
which
found
great
delight
thoroughly
old
fashioned
for
course
wanted
see
all
could
the
ways
the
country
was
evidently
expected
for
when
got
near
the
door
faced
cheery
looking
elderly
woman
the
usual
peasant
dress
white
undergarment
with
long
double
apron
front
and
back
coloured
stuff
fitting
almost
too
tight
for
modesty
when
came
close
she
bowed
and
said
the
herr
englishman
yes
said
jonathan
harker
she
smiled
and
gave
some
message
elderly
man
white
shirt
sleeves
who
had
followed
her
the
door
went
but
immediately
returned
with
letter
friend
welcome
the
carpathians
anxiously
expecting
you
sleep
well
night
three
morrow
the
diligence
will
start
for
bukovina
place
kept
for
you
the
borgo
pass
carriage
will
await
you
and
will
bring
you
trust
that
your
journey
from
london
has
been
happy
one
and
that
you
will
enjoy
your
stay
beautiful
land
your
friend
dracula
may
found
that
landlord
had
got
letter
from
the
count
directing
him
secure
the
best
place
the
coach
for
but
making
inquiries
details
seemed
somewhat
reticent
and
pretended
that
could
not
understand
german
this
could
not
true
because
then
had
understood
perfectly
least
answered
questions
exactly
did
and
his
wife
the
old
lady
who
had
received
looked
each
other
frightened
sort
way
mumbled
out
that
the
money
had
been
sent
letter
and
that
was
all
knew
when
asked
him
knew
count
dracula
and
could
tell
anything
his
castle
both
and
his
wife
crossed
themselves
and
saying
that
they
knew
nothing
all
simply
refused
speak
further
was
near
the
time
starting
that
had
time
ask
any
one
else
for
was
all
very
mysterious
and
not
any
means
comforting
just
before
was
leaving
the
old
lady
came
room
and
said
very
hysterical
way
must
you
young
herr
must
you
she
was
such
excited
state
that
she
seemed
have
lost
her
grip
what
german
she
knew
and
mixed
all
with
some
other
language
which
did
not
know
all
was
just
able
follow
her
asking
many
questions
when
told
her
that
must
once
and
that
was
engaged
important
business
she
asked
again
you
know
what
day
answered
that
was
the
fourth
may
she
shook
her
head
she
said
again
yes
know
that
know
that
but
you
know
what
day
saying
that
did
not
understand
she
went
the
eve
george
day
you
not
know
that
night
when
the
clock
strikes
midnight
all
the
evil
things
the
world
will
have
full
sway
you
know
where
you
are
going
and
what
you
are
going
she
was
such
evident
distress
that
tried
comfort
her
but
without
effect
finally
she
went
down
her
knees
and
implored
not
least
wait
day
two
before
starting
was
all
very
ridiculous
but
did
not
feel
comfortable
however
there
was
business
done
and
could
allow
nothing
interfere
with
therefore
tried
raise
her
and
said
gravely
could
that
thanked
her
but
duty
was
imperative
and
that
must
she
then
rose
and
dried
her
eyes
and
taking
crucifix
from
her
neck
offered
did
not
know
what
for
english
churchman
have
been
taught
regard
such
things
some
measure
idolatrous
and
yet
seemed
ungracious
refuse
old
lady
meaning
well
and
such
state
mind
she
saw
suppose
the
doubt
face
for
she
put
the
rosary
round
neck
and
said
for
your
mother
sake
and
went
out
the
room
writing
this
part
the
diary
whilst
waiting
for
the
coach
which
course
late
and
the
crucifix
still
round
neck
whether
the
old
lady
fear
the
many
ghostly
traditions
this
place
the
crucifix
itself
not
know
but
not
feeling
nearly
easy
mind
usual
this
book
should
ever
reach
mina
before
let
bring
good
bye
here
comes
the
coach
may
the
castle
the
grey
the
morning
has
passed
and
the
sun
high
over
the
distant
horizon
which
seems
jagged
whether
with
trees
hills
know
not
for
far
off
that
big
things
and
little
are
mixed
not
sleepy
and
not
called
till
awake
naturally
write
till
sleep
comes
there
are
many
odd
things
put
down
and
lest
who
reads
them
may
fancy
that
dined
too
well
before
left
bistritz
let
put
down
dinner
exactly
dined
what
they
called
robber
steak
bits
bacon
onion
and
beef
seasoned
with
red
pepper
and
strung
sticks
and
roasted
over
the
fire
the
simple
style
the
london
cat
meat
the
wine
was
golden
mediasch
which
produces
queer
sting
the
tongue
which
however
not
disagreeable
had
only
couple
glasses
this
and
nothing
else
when
got
the
coach
the
driver
had
not
taken
his
seat
and
saw
him
talking
with
the
landlady
they
were
evidently
talking
for
every
now
and
then
they
looked
and
some
the
people
who
were
sitting
the
bench
outside
the
door
which
they
call
name
meaning
word
bearer
came
and
listened
and
then
looked
most
them
pityingly
could
hear
lot
words
often
repeated
queer
words
for
there
were
many
nationalities
the
crowd
quietly
got
polyglot
dictionary
from
bag
and
looked
them
out
must
say
they
were
not
cheering
for
amongst
them
were
ordog
satan
pokol
hell
stregoica
witch
vrolok
and
vlkoslak
both
which
mean
the
same
thing
one
being
slovak
and
the
other
servian
for
something
that
either
were
wolf
vampire
mem
must
ask
the
count
about
these
superstitions
when
started
the
crowd
round
the
inn
door
which
had
this
time
swelled
considerable
size
all
made
the
sign
the
cross
and
pointed
two
fingers
towards
with
some
difficulty
got
fellow
passenger
tell
what
they
meant
would
not
answer
first
but
learning
that
was
english
explained
that
was
charm
guard
against
the
evil
eye
this
was
not
very
pleasant
for
just
starting
for
unknown
place
meet
unknown
man
but
every
one
seemed
kind
hearted
and
sorrowful
and
sympathetic
that
could
not
but
touched
shall
never
forget
the
last
glimpse
which
had
the
inn
yard
and
its
crowd
picturesque
figures
all
crossing
themselves
they
stood
round
the
wide
archway
with
its
background
rich
foliage
oleander
and
orange
trees
green
tubs
clustered
the
centre
the
yard
then
our
driver
whose
wide
linen
drawers
covered
the
whole
front
the
box
seat
gotza
they
call
them
cracked
his
big
whip
over
his
four
small
horses
which
ran
abreast
and
set
off
our
journey
soon
lost
sight
and
recollection
ghostly
fears
the
beauty
the
scene
drove
along
although
had
known
the
language
rather
languages
which
fellow
passengers
were
speaking
might
not
have
been
able
throw
them
off
easily
before
lay
green
sloping
land
full
forests
and
woods
with
here
and
there
steep
hills
crowned
with
clumps
trees
with
farmhouses
the
blank
gable
end
the
road
there
was
everywhere
bewildering
mass
fruit
blossom
apple
plum
pear
cherry
and
drove
could
see
the
green
grass
under
the
trees
spangled
with
the
fallen
petals
and
out
amongst
these
green
hills
what
they
call
here
the
mittel
land
ran
the
road
losing
itself
swept
round
the
grassy
curve
was
shut
out
the
straggling
ends
pine
woods
which
here
and
there
ran
down
the
hillsides
like
tongues
flame
the
road
was
rugged
but
still
seemed
fly
over
with
feverish
haste
could
not
understand
then
what
the
haste
meant
but
the
driver
was
evidently
bent
losing
time
reaching
borgo
prund
was
told
that
this
road
summertime
excellent
but
that
had
not
yet
been
put
order
after
the
winter
snows
this
respect
different
from
the
general
run
roads
the
carpathians
for
old
tradition
that
they
are
not
kept
too
good
order
old
the
hospadars
would
not
repair
them
lest
the
turk
should
think
that
they
were
preparing
bring
foreign
troops
and
hasten
the
war
which
was
always
really
loading
point
beyond
the
green
swelling
hills
the
mittel
land
rose
mighty
slopes
forest
the
lofty
steeps
the
carpathians
themselves
right
and
left
they
towered
with
the
afternoon
sun
falling
full
upon
them
and
bringing
out
all
the
glorious
colours
this
beautiful
range
deep
blue
and
purple
the
shadows
the
peaks
green
and
brown
where
grass
and
rock
mingled
and
endless
perspective
jagged
rock
and
pointed
crags
till
these
were
themselves
lost
the
distance
where
the
snowy
peaks
rose
grandly
here
and
there
seemed
mighty
rifts
the
mountains
through
which
the
sun
began
sink
saw
now
and
again
the
white
gleam
falling
water
one
companions
touched
arm
swept
round
the
base
hill
and
opened
the
lofty
snow
covered
peak
mountain
which
seemed
wound
our
serpentine
way
right
before
look
isten
szek
god
seat
and
crossed
himself
reverently
wound
our
endless
way
and
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
behind
the
shadows
the
evening
began
creep
round
this
was
emphasised
the
fact
that
the
snowy
mountain
top
still
held
the
sunset
and
seemed
glow
out
with
delicate
cool
pink
here
and
there
passed
cszeks
and
slovaks
all
picturesque
attire
but
noticed
that
goitre
was
painfully
prevalent
the
roadside
were
many
crosses
and
swept
companions
all
crossed
themselves
here
and
there
was
peasant
man
woman
kneeling
before
shrine
who
did
not
even
turn
round
approached
but
seemed
the
self
surrender
devotion
have
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
the
outer
world
there
were
many
things
new
for
instance
hay
ricks
the
trees
and
here
and
there
very
beautiful
masses
weeping
birch
their
white
stems
shining
like
silver
through
the
delicate
green
the
leaves
now
and
again
passed
leiter
wagon
the
ordinary
peasant
cart
with
its
long
snake
like
vertebra
calculated
suit
the
inequalities
the
road
this
were
sure
seated
quite
group
home
coming
peasants
the
cszeks
with
their
white
and
the
slovaks
with
their
coloured
sheepskins
the
latter
carrying
lance
fashion
their
long
staves
with
axe
end
the
evening
fell
began
get
very
cold
and
the
growing
twilight
seemed
merge
into
one
dark
mistiness
the
gloom
the
trees
oak
beech
and
pine
though
the
valleys
which
ran
deep
between
the
spurs
the
hills
ascended
through
the
pass
the
dark
firs
stood
out
here
and
there
against
the
background
late
lying
snow
sometimes
the
road
was
cut
through
the
pine
woods
that
seemed
the
darkness
closing
down
upon
great
masses
greyness
which
here
and
there
bestrewed
the
trees
produced
peculiarly
weird
and
solemn
effect
which
carried
the
thoughts
and
grim
fancies
engendered
earlier
the
evening
when
the
falling
sunset
threw
into
strange
relief
the
ghost
like
clouds
which
amongst
the
carpathians
seem
wind
ceaselessly
through
the
valleys
sometimes
the
hills
were
steep
that
despite
our
driver
haste
the
horses
could
only
slowly
wished
get
down
and
walk
them
home
but
the
driver
would
not
hear
said
you
must
not
walk
here
the
dogs
are
too
fierce
and
then
added
with
what
evidently
meant
for
grim
pleasantry
for
looked
round
catch
the
approving
smile
the
rest
and
you
may
have
enough
such
matters
before
you
sleep
the
only
stop
would
make
was
moment
pause
light
his
lamps
when
grew
dark
there
seemed
some
excitement
amongst
the
passengers
and
they
kept
speaking
him
one
after
the
other
though
urging
him
further
speed
lashed
the
horses
unmercifully
with
his
long
whip
and
with
wild
cries
encouragement
urged
them
further
exertions
then
through
the
darkness
could
see
sort
patch
grey
light
ahead
though
there
were
cleft
the
hills
the
excitement
the
passengers
grew
greater
the
crazy
coach
rocked
its
great
leather
springs
and
swayed
like
boat
tossed
stormy
sea
had
hold
the
road
grew
more
level
and
appeared
fly
along
then
the
mountains
seemed
come
nearer
each
side
and
frown
down
upon
were
entering
the
borgo
pass
one
one
several
the
passengers
offered
gifts
which
they
pressed
upon
with
earnestness
which
would
take
denial
these
were
certainly
odd
and
varied
kind
but
each
was
given
simple
good
faith
with
kindly
word
and
blessing
and
that
strange
mixture
fear
meaning
movements
which
had
seen
outside
the
hotel
bistritz
the
sign
the
cross
and
the
guard
against
the
evil
eye
then
flew
along
the
driver
leaned
forward
and
each
side
the
passengers
craning
over
the
edge
the
coach
peered
eagerly
into
the
darkness
was
evident
that
something
very
exciting
was
either
happening
expected
but
though
asked
each
passenger
one
would
give
the
slightest
explanation
this
state
excitement
kept
for
some
little
time
and
last
saw
before
the
pass
opening
out
the
eastern
side
there
were
dark
rolling
clouds
overhead
and
the
air
the
heavy
oppressive
sense
thunder
seemed
though
the
mountain
range
had
separated
two
atmospheres
and
that
now
had
got
into
the
thunderous
one
was
now
myself
looking
out
for
the
conveyance
which
was
take
the
count
each
moment
expected
see
the
glare
lamps
through
the
blackness
but
all
was
dark
the
only
light
was
the
flickering
rays
our
own
lamps
which
the
steam
from
our
hard
driven
horses
rose
white
cloud
could
see
now
the
sandy
road
lying
white
before
but
there
was
sign
vehicle
the
passengers
drew
back
with
sigh
gladness
which
seemed
mock
own
disappointment
was
already
thinking
what
had
best
when
the
driver
looking
his
watch
said
the
others
something
which
could
hardly
hear
was
spoken
quietly
and
low
tone
thought
was
hour
less
than
the
time
then
turning

whilst
was

the
horses
began
neigh
and

and

wildly
that
the

had

them
then
amongst
chorus
screams
from
the
peasants
and
universal
crossing
themselves

with
four
horses
drove
behind
overtook
and
drew
beside
the
coach
could
see
from
the
flash
our
lamps
the
rays
fell
them
that
the
horses
were
coal
black
and
splendid
animals
they
were
driven
tall
man
with
long
brown
beard
and
great
black
hat
which
seemed

his
face
from
could
only
see
the
gleam
pair
very
bright
eyes
which
seemed
red
the
lamplight
turned
said
the
driver

the

stammered

the

that

and
the

and

one

whispered
another
the

for
the

fast
the
strange
driver
evidently
heard
the
words
for
looked
with
gleaming
smile
the
passenger
turned
his
face
away
the
same
time
putting
out
his
two
fingers
and
crossing
himself
give
the
herr
luggage
said
the
driver
and
with
exceeding
alacrity
bags
were
handed
out
and
put
the
caleche
then
descended
from
the
side
the
coach
the
caleche
was
close
alongside
the
driver
helping
with
hand
which
caught
arm
grip
steel
his
strength
must
have
been
prodigious
without
word
shook
his
reins
the
horses
turned
and
swept
into
the
darkness
the
pass
looked
back
saw
the
steam
from
the
horses
the
coach
the
light
the
lamps
and
projected
against
the
figures
late
companions
crossing
themselves
then
the
driver
cracked
his
whip
and
called
his
horses
and
off
they
swept
their
way
bukovina
they
sank
into
the
darkness
felt
strange
chill
and
lonely
feeling
came
over
but
cloak
was
thrown
over
shoulders
and
rug
across
knees
and
the
driver
said
excellent
german
the
night
chill
mein
herr
and
master
the
count
bade
take
all
care
you
there

the

the

underneath
the

you
should
require
did
not
take
any
but
was
comfort
know
was
there
all
the
same
felt
little
strangely
and
not
little
frightened
think
had
there
been
any
alternative
should
have
taken
instead
prosecuting
that
unknown
night
journey
the
carriage
went
hard
pace
straight
along
then
made
complete
turn
and
went
along
another
straight
road
seemed
that
were
simply
going
over
and
over
the
same
ground
again
and
took
note
some
salient
point
and
found
that
this
was
would
have
liked
have
asked
the
driver
what
this
all
meant
but
really
feared
for
thought
that
placed
was
any
protest
would
have
had
effect
case
there
had
been
intention
delay
and
however
was
curious
know
how
time
was
passing
struck
match
and
its
flame
looked
watch
was
within
few
minutes
midnight
this
gave
sort
shock
for
suppose
the
general
superstition
about
midnight
was
increased
recent
experiences
waited
with
sick
feeling
suspense
then
dog
began
howl
somewhere
farmhouse
far
down
the
road
long
agonised
wailing
from
fear
the
sound
was
taken
another
dog
and
then
another
and
another
till
borne
the
wind
which
now
sighed
softly
through
the
pass
wild
howling
began
which
seemed
come
from
all
over
the
country
far
the
imagination
could
grasp
through
the
gloom
the
night
the
first
howl
the
horses
began
strain
and
rear
but
the
driver
spoke
them
soothingly
and
they
quieted
down
but
shivered
and
sweated
though
after
runaway
from
sudden
fright
then
far
off
the
distance
from
the
mountains
each
side
began
louder
and
sharper
howling
that
wolves
which
affected
both
the
horses
and
myself
the
same
way
for
was
minded
jump
from
the
caleche
and
run
whilst
they
reared
again
and
plunged
madly
that
the
driver
had
use
all
his
great
strength
keep
them
from
bolting
few
minutes
however
own
ears
got
accustomed
the
sound
and
the
horses
far
became
quiet
that
the
driver
was
able
descend
and
stand
before
them
petted
and
soothed
them
and
whispered
something
their
ears
have
heard
horse
tamers
doing
and
with
extraordinary
effect
for
under
his
caresses
they
became
quite
manageable
again
though
they
still
trembled
the
driver
again
took
his
seat
and
shaking
his
reins
started
off
great
pace
this
time
after
going
the
far
side
the
pass
suddenly
turned
down
narrow
roadway
which
ran
sharply
the
right
soon
were
hemmed
with
trees
which
places
arched
right
over
the
roadway
till
passed
through
tunnel
and
again
great
frowning
rocks
guarded
boldly
either
side
though
were
shelter
could
hear
the
rising
wind
for
moaned
and
whistled
through
the
rocks
and
the
branches
the
trees
crashed
together
swept
along
grew
colder
and
colder
still
and
fine
powdery
snow
began
fall
that
soon
and
all
around
were
covered
with
white
blanket
the
keen
wind
still
carried
the
howling
the
dogs
though
this
grew
fainter
went
our
way
the
baying
the
wolves
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
though
they
were
closing
round
from
every
side
grew
dreadfully
afraid
and
the
horses
shared
fear
the
driver
however
was
not
the
least
disturbed
kept
turning
his
head
left
and
right
but
could
not
see
anything
through
the
darkness
suddenly
away
our
left
saw
faint
flickering
blue
flame
the
driver
saw
the
same
moment
once
checked
the
horses
and
jumping
the
ground
disappeared
into
the
darkness
did
not
know
what
the
less
the
howling
the
wolves
grew
closer
but
while
wondered
the
driver
suddenly
appeared
again
and
without
word
took
his
seat
and
resumed
our
journey
think
must
have
fallen
asleep
and
kept
dreaming
the
incident
for
seemed
repeated
endlessly
and
now
looking
back
like
sort
awful
nightmare
once
the
flame
appeared
near
the
road
that
even
the
darkness
around
could
watch
the
driver
motions
went
rapidly
where
the
blue
flame
arose
must
have
been
very
faint
for
did
not
seem
illumine
the
place
around
all
and
gathering
few
stones
formed
them
into
some
device
once
there
appeared
strange
optical
effect
when
stood
between
and
the
flame
did
not
obstruct
for
could
see
its
ghostly
flicker
all
the
same
this
startled
but
the
effect
was
only
momentary
took
that
eyes
deceived
straining
through
the
darkness
then
for
time
there
were
blue
flames
and
sped
onwards
through
the
gloom
with
the
howling
the
wolves
around
though
they
were
following
moving
circle
last
there
came
time
when
the
driver
went
further
afield
than
had
yet
gone
and
during
his
absence
the
horses
began
tremble
worse
than
ever
and
snort
and
scream
with
fright
could
not
see
any
cause
for
for
the
howling
the
wolves
had
ceased
altogether
but
just
then
the
moon
sailing
through
the
black
clouds
appeared
behind
the
jagged
crest
beetling
pine
clad
rock
and
its
light
saw
around
ring
wolves
with
white
teeth
and
lolling
red
tongues
with
long
sinewy
limbs
and
shaggy
hair
they
were
hundred
times
more
terrible
the
grim
silence
which
held
them
than
even
when
they
howled
for
myself
felt
sort
paralysis
fear
only
when
man
feels
himself
face
face
with
such
horrors
that
can
understand
their
true
import
all
once
the
wolves
began
howl
though
the
moonlight
had
had
some
peculiar
effect
them
the
horses
jumped
about
and
reared
and
looked
helplessly
round
with
eyes
that
rolled
way
painful
see
but
the
living
ring
terror
encompassed
them
every
side
and
they
had
perforce
remain
within
called
the
coachman
come
for
seemed
that
our
only
chance
was
try
break
out
through
the
ring
and
aid
his
approach
shouted
and
beat
the
side
the
caleche
hoping
the
noise
scare
the
wolves
from
that
side
give
him
chance
reaching
the
trap
how
came
there
know
not
but
heard
his
voice
raised
tone
imperious
command
and
looking
towards
the
sound
saw
him
stand
the
roadway
swept
his
long
arms
though
brushing
aside
some
impalpable
obstacle
the
wolves
fell
back
and
back
further
still
just
then
heavy
cloud
passed
across
the
face
the
moon
that
were
again
darkness
when
could
see
again
the
driver
was
climbing
into
the
caleche
and
the
wolves
had
disappeared
this
was
all
strange
and
uncanny
that
dreadful
fear
came
upon
and
was
afraid
speak
move
the
time
seemed
interminable
swept
our
way
now
almost
complete
darkness
for
the
rolling
clouds
obscured
the
moon
kept
ascending
with
occasional
periods
quick
descent
but
the
main
always
ascending
suddenly
became
conscious
the
fact
that
the
driver
was
the
act
pulling
the
horses
the
courtyard
vast
ruined
castle
from
whose
tall
black
windows
came

and
among

carpathians
all
could
now
was
patient
and
wait
the
coming
the
morning
just
had
come
this
conclusion
heard
heavy
step
approaching
behind
the
great
door
and
saw
through
the
chinks
the
gleam
coming
light
then
there
was
the
sound
rattling
chains
and
the
clanking
massive
bolts
drawn
back
key
was
turned
with
the
loud
grating
noise
long
disuse
and
the
great
door
swung
back
within
stood
tall
old
man
clean
shaven
save
for
long
white
moustache
and
clad
black
from

without

about

with

intonation

your

stood
like
statue
though
his
gesture
welcome
had
fixed
him
into
stone
the
instant
however
that
had
stepped
over
the
threshold
moved
impulsively
forward
and
holding
out
his
hand
grasped
mine
with
strength
which
made
wince
effect
which
was
not
lessened
the
fact
that
seemed
cold
ice
more
like
the
hand
dead
than
living
man
again
said
welcome
house
come
freely
safely
and
leave
something
the
happiness
you
bring
the
strength
the
handshake
was
much
akin
that
which
had

along

laid
out
host
who
stood
one
side
the
great
fireplace
leaning
against
the
stonework
made
graceful
wave
his
hand
the

and
said

the
count
himself
came
forward
and
took
off
the
cover

and
fell
once
excellent
roast
chicken
this
with
some
cheese
and
salad
and
bottle
old
tokay
which
had
two
glasses
was

during
the
time
was
eating
the

asked
many
questions

and
told
him
degrees
all
had
experienced
this
time
had
finished
supper
and
host
desire
had
drawn
chair
the
fire
and
begun
smoke
cigar
which
offered
the
same
time
excusing
himself
that
did
not
smoke
had
now
opportunity
observing
him
and
found
him
very
marked
physiognomy
his
face
was
strong
very
strong
aquiline
with
high
bridge
the
thin
nose
and
peculiarly
arched
nostrils
with
lofty
domed
forehead
and
hair
growing
scantily
round
the
temples
but
profusely
elsewhere
his
eyebrows
were
very
massive
almost
meeting
over
the
nose
and
with
bushy
hair
that
seemed
curl
its
own
profusion
the
mouth
far
could
see
under
the
heavy
moustache
was
fixed
and
rather
cruel
looking
with
peculiarly
sharp
white
teeth
these
protruded
over
the
lips
whose
remarkable
ruddiness
showed
astonishing
vitality
man
his
years
for
the
rest
his
ears
were
pale
and
the
tops
extremely
pointed
the
chin
was
broad
and
strong
and
the
cheeks
firm
though
thin
the
general
effect
was
one
extraordinary
pallor
hitherto
had
noticed
the
backs
his
hands
they
lay
his
knees
the
firelight
and
they
had
seemed
rather
white
and
fine
but
seeing
them
now
close
could
not
but
notice
that
they
were
rather
coarse
broad
with
squat
fingers
strange
say
there
were
hairs
the
centre
the
palm
the
nails
were
long
and
fine
and
cut
sharp
point
the
count
leaned
over
and
his
hands
touched
could
not
repress
shudder
may
have
been
that
his
breath
was
rank
but
horrible
feeling
nausea
came
over
which
what
would
could
not
conceal
the
count
evidently
noticing
drew
back
and
with
grim
sort
smile
which
showed
more
than
had
yet
done
his
protuberant
teeth
sat
himself
down
again
his
own
side
the
fireplace
were
both
silent
for
while
and
looked
towards
the
window
saw
the
first
dim
streak
the
coming
dawn
there
seemed
strange
stillness
over
everything
but
listened
heard
from
down
below
the
valley
the
howling
many
wolves
the
count
eyes
gleamed
and
said
listen
them
the
children
the
night
what
music
they
make
seeing
suppose
some
expression
face
strange
him
added
sir
you
dwellers
the
city
cannot
enter
into
the
feelings
the
hunter
then
rose
and
said
but
you
must
tired
your
bedroom
all
ready
and
morrow
you
shall
sleep
late
you
will
have
away
till
the
afternoon

courteous
bow

for
himself
the

the
octagonal
room
and
entered

only
for
the

those
dear
may
again
early
morning
but
have
rested
and
enjoyed
the
last
twenty
four
hours
slept
till
late
the
day
and
awoke
own
accord
when
had
dressed
myself
went
into
the
room
where
had
supped
and
found
cold
breakfast
laid
out
with

there
was

meal
when

done
looked
for
bell
that
might
let
the
servants
know
had
finished
but
could
not
find

there
are
certainly
odd
deficiencies
the
house
considering
the
extraordinary
evidences

which
are
round

the

the

sofas
and
the
hangings

the
costliest
and
most
beautiful
fabrics
and
must
have
been
fabulous

when
they
were
made
for
they
are
centuries
old
though
excellent
order
saw
something

clock
when
had
looked

whilst

the
door
opened
and
the
count
entered
saluted
hearty

hoped
that

had
good
night
rest
then
went
glad
you
found
your

much
that
will
interest

and
laid

many
many
hours
pleasure
through

but
count
said

thoroughly
bowed
gravely
thank
you
friend
for
your
all
too
flattering
estimate
but
yet
fear
that
but
little
way
the
road
would
travel
true
know
the
grammar
and
the
words
but
yet
know
not
how

peter
hawkins
exeter
tell
all
about

london
you
shall
trust
rest
here
with
awhile
that
our
talking
may
learn
the
english
intonation
and
would
that
you
tell
when
make
error
even
the
smallest
speaking
sorry
that
had
away
long
day
but
you
will
know
forgive
one
who
has
many
important
affairs
hand
course
said
all
could
about
being
willing
and
asked
might
come
into
that
room
when
chose
answered
yes
certainly
and
added
you
may
anywhere
you
wish
the
castle
except
where
the
doors
are
locked
where
course
you
will
not
wish
there
reason
that
all
things
are
they
are
and
did
you
see
with
eyes
and
know
with
knowledge
you
would
perhaps
better
understand
said
was
sure
this
and
then
went
are
transylvania
and
transylvania
not
england
our
ways
are
not
your
ways
and
there
shall
you
many
strange
things
nay
from
what
you
have
told
your
experiences
already
you
know
something
what
strange
things
there
may
this
led
much
conversation
and
was
evident
that
wanted
talk
only
for
talking
sake
asked
him
many
questions
regarding
things
that
had
already
happened
come
within
notice
sometimes
sheered
off
the
subject
turned
the
conversation
pretending
not
understand
but
generally
answered
all
asked
most
frankly
then
time
went
and
had
got
somewhat
bolder
asked
him
some
the
strange
things
the
preceding
night
for
instance
why
the
coachman
went
the
places
where
had
seen
the
blue
flames
then
explained
that
was
commonly
believed
that
certain
night
the
year
last
night
fact
when
all
evil
spirits
are
supposed
have
unchecked
sway
blue
flame
seen
over
any
place
where
treasure
has
been
concealed
that
treasure
has
been
hidden
went
the
region
through
which
you
came
last
night
there
can
but
little
doubt
for
was
the
ground
fought
over
for
centuries
the
wallachian
the
saxon
and
the
turk
why
there
hardly
foot
soil
all
this
region
that
has
not
been
enriched
the
blood
men
patriots
invaders
old
days
there
were
stirring
times
when
the
austrian
and
the
hungarian
came
hordes
and
the
patriots
went
out
meet
them
men
and
women
the
aged
and
the
children
too
and
waited
their
coming
the
rocks
above
the
passes
that
they
might
sweep
destruction
them
with
their
artificial
avalanches
when
the
invader
was
triumphant
found
but
little
for
whatever
there
was
had
been
sheltered
the
friendly
soil
but
how
said
can
have
remained
long
undiscovered
when
there
sure
index
men
will
but
take
the
trouble
look
the
count
smiled
and
his
lips
ran
back
over
his
gums
the
long
sharp
canine
teeth
showed
out
strangely
answered
because
your
peasant
heart
coward
and
fool
those
flames
only
appear
one
night
and
that
night
man
this
land
will
can
help
stir
without
his
doors
and
dear
sir
even
did
would
not
know
what
why
even
the
peasant
that
you
tell
who
marked
the
place
the
flame
would
not
know
where
look
daylight
even
for
his
own
work
even
you
would
not
dare
sworn
able
find
these
places
again
there
you
are
right
said
know
more
than
the
dead
where
even
look
for
them
then
drifted
into
other
matters
come
said
last
tell
london
and
the
house
which
you
have
procured
for
with
apology
for
remissness
went
into
own
room
get
the
papers
from
bag
whilst
was
placing
them
order
heard
rattling
china
and
silver
the
next
room
and
passed
through

that
the

been
cleared

the

came
cleared
the
books
and
papers
from
the
table
and
with
him
went
into
plans
and
deeds
and
figures
all
sorts
was
interested
everything
and
asked
myriad
questions
about
the
place
and
its
surroundings
clearly
had
studied
beforehand
all
could
get
the

for
evidently
the

hawkins

was
that
his

made
his

look
malignant
and
saturnine
presently
with
excuse
left
asking
put
all
papers
together
was
some
little
time
away
and
began
look
some
the
books
around
one
was
atlas
which
found
opened
naturally
england
that
map
had
been
much
used
looking
found
certain
places
little
rings
marked
and
examining
these
noticed
that
one
was
near
london
the
east
side
manifestly
where
his
new
estate
was
situated
the
other
two
were
exeter
and
whitby
the
yorkshire
coast
was
the
better
part
hour
when
the
count
returned
aha
said
still
your
books
good
but
you
must
not
work
always
come
informed
that
your
supper
ready
took
arm
and
went
into
the
next
room
where
found
excellent
supper
ready
the
table
the
count
again
excused
himself
had
dined
out
his
being
away
from
home
but
sat
the
previous
night
and
chatted
whilst
ate
after
supper
smoked
the
last
evening
and
the
count
stayed
with
chatting
and
asking
questions
every
conceivable
subject
hour
after
hour
felt
that
was
getting
very
late
indeed
but
did
not
say
anything
for
felt
under
obligation
meet
host
wishes
every
way
was
not
sleepy
the
long
sleep
yesterday
had
fortified
but
could
not
help
experiencing
that
chill
which
comes
over
one
the
coming
the
dawn
which
like
its
way
the
turn
the
tide
they
say
that
people
who
are
near
death
die
generally
the
change
the

the
turn
the
tide
any

who
has
when

once
heard
the
crow
cock
coming
with
preternatural
shrillness
through
the
clear
morning
air
count
dracula
jumping
his
feet
said
why
there
the
morning
again
how
remiss
let
you
stay
long
you
must
make
your
conversation
regarding
dear
new
country
england
less
interesting
that
may
not
forget
how
time
flies
and
with
courtly
bow
quickly
left
went
into
own
room
and
drew
the
curtains
but
there
was
little
notice
window
opened
into
the
courtyard
all
could
see
was
the
warm
grey
quickening
sky
pulled
the
curtains
again
and
have
written
this
day
may
began
fear
wrote
this
book
that
was
getting
too
diffuse
but
now
glad
that
went
into
detail
from
the
first
for
there
something
strange
about
this
place
and
all
that
cannot
but
feel
uneasy
wish
were
safe
out
that
had
never
come
may
that
this
strange
night
existence
telling
but
would
that
that
were
all
there
were
any
one
talk
could
bear
but
there
one
have
only
the
count
speak
with
and
fear
myself
the
only
living
soul
within
the
place
let
prosaic
far
facts
can
will
help
bear
and
imagination
must
not
run
riot
with
does
lost
let
say
once
how
stand
seem
only
slept
few
hours
when
went
bed
and
feeling
that
could
not
sleep
any
more
got
had
hung
shaving
glass
the
window
and
was
just
beginning
shave
suddenly
felt
hand
shoulder
and
heard
the
count
voice
saying
good
morning
started
for
amazed
that
had
not
seen
him
since
the
reflection
the
glass
covered
the
whole
room
behind
starting
had
cut
myself
slightly
but
did
not
notice
the
moment
having
answered
the
count
salutation
turned
the
glass
again
see
how
had
been
mistaken
this
time
there
could
error
for
the
man
was
close
and
could
see
him
over
shoulder
but
there
was
reflection
him
the
mirror
the
whole
room
behind
was
displayed
but
there
was
sign
man
except
myself
this
was
startling
and
coming
the
top
many
strange
things
was
beginning
increase
that
vague
feeling
uneasiness
which
always
have
when
the
count
near
but
the
instant
saw
that
the
cut
had
bled
little
and
the
blood
was
trickling
over
chin
laid
down
the
razor
turning
did
half
round
look
for
some
sticking
plaster
when
the
count
saw
face
his
eyes
blazed
with
sort
demoniac
fury
and
suddenly
made
grab
throat
drew
away
and
his
hand
touched
the
string
beads
which
held
the
crucifix
made
instant
change
him
for
the
fury
passed
quickly
that
could
hardly
believe
that
was
ever
there
take
care
said
take
care
how
you
cut
yourself
more
dangerous
than
you
think
this
country
then
seizing
the
shaving
glass
went
and
this
the
wretched
thing
that
has
done
the
mischief
foul
bauble
man
vanity
away
with
and
opening
the
heavy
window
with
one
wrench
his
terrible
hand
flung
out
the
glass
which
was
shattered
into
thousand
pieces
the
stones
the
courtyard
far
below
then
withdrew
without
word
very
annoying
for
not
see
how
shave
unless
watch
case
the
bottom
the
shaving
pot
which
fortunately
metal
when
went
into
the
dining
room
breakfast
was
prepared
but
could
not
find
the
count
anywhere
breakfasted
alone
strange
that
yet
have
not
seen
the
count
eat
drink
must
very
peculiar
man
after
breakfast
did
little
exploring
the
castle
went
out
the
stairs
and
found
room
looking
towards
the
south
the
view
was
magnificent
and
from
where
stood
there
was
every
opportunity
seeing
the
castle
the
very
edge
terrible
precipice
stone
falling
from
the
window
would
fall
thousand
feet
without
touching
anything
far
the
eye
can
reach
sea
green

with
occasionally
deep
rift
where
there
chasm
here
and
there
are
silver
threads
where
the
rivers
wind
deep
gorges
through
the
forests
but
not

beauty
for
when
had
seen
the
view
explored
further
doors
doors

and
all
locked

veritable

journal
continued
when
found
that
was
prisoner
sort
wild
feeling
came
over
rushed
and
down
the
stairs
trying
every
door
and
peering
out
every
window
could
find
but
after
little
the
conviction
helplessness
overpowered
all
other
feelings
when
look
back
after
few
hours
think
must
have
been
mad
for
the
time
for
behaved
much
rat
does
trap
when
however
the
conviction
had
come
that
was
helpless
sat
down
quietly
quietly
have
ever
done
anything
life
and
began
think
over
what
was
best
done
thinking
still
and
yet
have
come
definite
conclusion
one
thing
only
certain
that
use
making
ideas
known
the
count
knows
well
that
imprisoned
and
has
done
himself
and
has
doubtless
his
own
motives
for
would
only
deceive
trusted
him
fully
with
the
facts
far
can
see
only
plan
will
keep
knowledge
and
fears
myself
and
eyes
open
know
either
being
deceived
like
baby
own
fears
else
desperate
straits
and
the
latter
need
and
shall
need
all
brains
get
through
had
hardly
come
this
conclusion
when
heard
the
great
door
below
shut
and
knew
that
the
count
had
returned
did
not
come
once
into
the
library
went
cautiously
own
room
and
found
him
making
the
bed
this
was
odd
but
only
confirmed
what
had
all
along
thought
that
there
were
servants
the
house
when
later
saw
him
through
the
chink
the
hinges
the
door
laying
the
table
the
dining
room
was
assured
for
does
himself
all
these
menial
offices
surely
proof
that
there
one
else
them
this
gave
fright
for
there
one
else
the
castle
must
have
been
the
count
himself
who
was
the
driver
the
coach
that
brought
here
this
terrible
thought
for
what
does
mean
that
could
control
the
wolves
did
only
holding
his
hand
silence
how
was
that
all
the
people
bistritz
and
the
coach
had
some
terrible
fear
for
what
meant
the
giving
the
crucifix
the
garlic
the
wild
rose
the
mountain
ash
bless
that
good
good
woman
who
hung
the
crucifix
round
neck
for
comfort
and
strength
whenever
touch
odd
that
thing
which
have
been
taught
regard
with
disfavour
and
idolatrous
should
time
loneliness
and
trouble
help
that
there
something
the
essence
the
thing
itself
that
medium
tangible
help
conveying
memories
sympathy
and
comfort
some
time
may
must
examine
this
matter
and
try
make
mind
about
the
meantime
must
find
out
all
can
about
count
dracula
may
help
understand
night
may
talk
himself
turn
the
conversation
that
way
must
very
careful
however
not
awake
his
suspicion
midnight
have
had
long
talk
with
the
count
asked
him
few
questions
transylvania
history
and
warmed
the
subject
wonderfully
his
speaking
things
and
people
and
especially
battles
spoke
had
been
present
them
all
this
afterwards
explained
saying
that
boyar
the
pride
his
house
and
name
his
own
pride
that
their
glory
his
glory
that
their
fate
his
fate
whenever
spoke
his
house
always
said
and
spoke
almost
the
plural
like
king
speaking
wish
could
put
down
all
said
exactly
said
for
was
most
fascinating
seemed
have
whole
history
the
country
grew
excited
spoke
and
walked
about
the
room
pulling
his
great
white
moustache
and
grasping
anything
which
laid
his
hands
though
would
crush
main
strength
one
thing
said
which
shall
put
down
nearly
can
for
tells
its
way
the
story
his
race
szekelys
have
right
proud
for
our
veins
flows
the
blood
many
brave
races
who
fought
the
lion
fights
for
lordship
here
the
whirlpool
european
races
the
ugric
tribe
bore
down
from
iceland
the
fighting
spirit
which
thor
and
wodin
gave
them
which
their
berserkers
displayed
such
fell
intent
the
seaboards
europe
and
asia
and
africa
too
till
the
peoples
thought
that
the
were
wolves
themselves
had
come
here
too
when
they
came
they
found
the
huns
whose
warlike
fury
had
swept
the
earth
like
living
flame
till
the
dying
peoples
held
that
their
veins
ran
the
blood
those
old
witches
who
expelled
from
scythia
had
mated
with
the
devils
the
desert
fools

what
devil
what
witch
was
ever
great
attila
whose

these

held
his

wonder
that
were
conquering
race
that
were
proud
that
when
the
magyar
the
lombard
the
avar
the
bulgar
the
turk
poured
his
thousands
our
frontiers
drove
them
back
strange
that
when
arpad
and
his
legions
swept
through
the
hungarian
fatherland
found
here
when
reached
the
frontier
that
the
honfoglalas
was
completed
there
and
when
the
hungarian
flood
swept
eastward
the
szekelys
were
claimed
kindred
the
victorious
magyars
and
for
centuries
was
trusted
the
guarding
the
frontier
turkey
land
and
more
than
that
endless
duty
the
frontier
guard
for
the
turks
say
water
sleeps
and
enemy
sleepless
who
more
gladly
than
throughout
the
four
nations
received
the
bloody
sword
its
warlike
call
flocked
quicker
the
standard
the
king
when
was
redeemed
that
great
shame
nation
the
shame
cassova
when
the
flags
the
wallach
and
the
magyar
went
down
beneath
the
crescent
who
was
but
one
own
race
who
voivode
crossed
the
danube
and
beat
the
turk
his
own
ground
this
was
dracula
indeed
woe
was
that
his
own
unworthy
brother
when
had
fallen
sold
his
people
the
turk
and
brought
the
shame
slavery
them
was
not
this
dracula
indeed
who
inspired
that
other
his
race
who
later
age
again
and
again
brought
his
forces
over
the
great
river
into
turkey
land
who
when
was
beaten
back
came
again
and
again
and
again
though
had
come
alone
from
the
bloody
field
where
his
troops
were
being
slaughtered
since
knew
that
alone
could
ultimately
triumph
they
said
that
thought
only
himself
bah
what
good
are
peasants
without
leader
where
ends
the
war
without
brain
and
heart
conduct
again
when
after
the
battle
mohacs
threw
off
the
hungarian
yoke
the
dracula
blood
were
amongst
their
leaders
for
our
spirit
would
not
brook
that
were
not
free
young
sir
the
szekelys
and
the
dracula
their
heart
blood
their
brains
and
their
swords
can
boast
record
that
mushroom
growths
like
the
hapsburgs
and
the
romanoffs
can
never
reach
the
warlike
days
are
over
blood
too
precious
thing
these
days
dishonourable
peace
and
the
glories
the
great
races
are
tale
that
told
was
this
time
close
morning
and
went
bed
mem
this
diary
seems
horribly
like
the
beginning
the
arabian
nights
for
everything
has
break
off
cockcrow
like
the
ghost
hamlet
father
may
let
begin
with
facts
bare
meagre
facts
verified
books
and
figures
and
which
there
can
doubt
must
not
confuse
them
with
experiences
which
will
have
rest
own
observation
memory
them
last
evening
when
the
count
came
from
his
room
began
asking
questions
legal
matters
and
the
doing
certain
kinds
business
had
spent
the
day
wearily
over
books
and
simply
keep
mind
occupied
went
over
some
the
matters
had
been
examined
lincoln
inn
there
was
certain
method
the
count
inquiries
shall
try
put
them
down
sequence
the
knowledge
may
somehow
some
time
useful
first
asked
man
england
might
have
two
solicitors
more
told
him
might
have
dozen
wished
but
that
would
not
wise
have
more
than
one
solicitor
engaged
one
transaction
only
one
could
act
time
and
that
change
would
certain
militate
against
his
interest
seemed
thoroughly
understand
and
went
ask
there
would
any
practical
difficulty
having
one
man
attend
say
banking
and
another
look
after
shipping
case
local
help
were
needed
place
far
from
the
home
the
banking
solicitor
asked
him
explain
more
fully
that
might
not
any
chance
mislead
him
said
shall
illustrate
your
friend
and
mine
peter
hawkins
from
under
the
shadow
your
beautiful
cathedral
exeter
which
far
from
london
buys
for
through
your
good
self
place
london
good
now
here
let
say
frankly
lest
you
should
think
strange
that
have
sought
the
services
one
far
off
from
london
instead
some
one
resident
there
that
motive
was
that
local
interest
might
served
save
wish
only
and
one
london
residence
might
perhaps
have
some
purpose
himself
friend
serve
went
thus
afield
seek
agent
whose
labours
should
only
interest
now
suppose
who
have
much
affairs
wish
ship
goods
say
newcastle
durham
harwich
dover
might
not
that
could
with
more
ease
done
consigning
one
these
ports
answered
that
certainly
would
most
easy
but
that
solicitors
had
system
agency
one
for
the
other
that
local
work
could
done
locally
instruction
from
any
solicitor
that
the
client
simply
placing
himself
the
hands
one
man
could
have
his
wishes
carried
out
him
without
further
trouble
but
said
could
liberty
direct
myself
not
course
replied
and
such
often
done
men
business
who
not
like
the
whole
their
affairs
known
any
one
person
good
said
and
then
went
ask
about
the
means
making
consignments
and
the
forms
gone
through
and
all
sorts
difficulties
which
might
arise
but
forethought
could
guarded
against
explained
all
these
things
him
the
best
ability
and
certainly
left
under
the
impression
that
would
have
made
wonderful
solicitor
for
there
was
nothing
that
did
not
think
foresee
for
man
who
was
never
the
country
and
who
did
not
evidently
much
the
way
business
his
knowledge
and
acumen
were
wonderful
when
had
satisfied
himself
these
points
which
had
spoken
and
had
verified
all
well
could
the
books
available
suddenly
stood
and
said
have
you
written
since
your
first
letter
our
friend
peter
hawkins
any
other
was
with
some
bitterness
heart
that
answered
that
had
not
that
yet
had
not
seen
any
opportunity
sending
letters
anybody
then
write
now
young
friend
said
laying
heavy
hand
shoulder
write
our
friend
and
any
other
and
say
will
please
you
that
you
shall
stay
with
until
month
from
now
you
wish
stay
long
asked
for
heart
grew
cold
the
thought
desire
much
nay
will
take
refusal
when
your
master
employer
what
you
will
engaged
that
someone
should
come
his
behalf
was
understood
that
needs
only
were
consulted
have
not
stinted
not
what
could
but
bow
acceptance
was
hawkins
interest
not
mine
and
had
think
him
not
myself
and
besides
while
count
dracula
was
speaking
there
was
that
his
eyes
and
his
bearing
which
made
remember
that
was
prisoner
and
that
wished
could
have
choice
the
count
saw
his
victory
bow
and
his
mastery
the
trouble
face
for
began
once
use
them
but
his
own
smooth
resistless
way
pray
you
good
young
friend
that
you
will
not
discourse
things
other
than
business
your
letters
will
doubtless
please
your
friends
know
that
you
are
well
and
that
you
look
forward
getting
home

not
spoke
handed
three
sheets
note

and
three
envelopes
they
were
all
the
thinnest
foreign
post
and
looking
them
then
him
and
noticing
his
quiet
smile
with
the
sharp
canine
teeth
lying
over
the
red
underlip
understood
well
had
spoken
that
should
careful
what

write
only
formal
notes
now
but
write
fully

also

would
puzzle

see
when

book
whilst
the
count
wrote
several
notes

wrote
them
some
books

table
then
took
two
and
placed
them
with
his
own
and
put
his
writing
materials
after
which
the
instant
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
leaned
over
and
looked
the
letters
which
were
face
down

before
the

holding
still
another

his
hand
entered
the
room
took
the
letters

and
stamped
them
carefully
and
then
turning
said

you
like

haste
your
own
chamber
these
rooms
for
your
rest
will
then
safe
but
you
not
careful
this
respect
then
finished
his
speech
gruesome
way
for
motioned
with
his
hands
were
washing
them
quite
understood
only
doubt
was
whether
any
dream
could
more
terrible
than
the
unnatural
horrible
net
gloom
and
mystery
which
seemed
closing
around
later
endorse
the
last
words
written
but
this
time
there
doubt
question
shall
not
fear
sleep
any
place
where
not
have
placed
the
crucifix
over
the
head
bed
imagine
that
rest
thus
freer
from
dreams
and
there
shall
remain
when
left
went
room
after
little
while
not
hearing
any
sound
came
out
and
went
the
stone
stair
where
could
look
out
towards
the
south
there
was
some
sense
freedom
the
vast
expanse
inaccessible
though
was
compared
with
the
narrow
darkness
the
courtyard
looking
out
this
felt
that
was
indeed
prison
and
seemed
want
breath
fresh
air
though
were
the
night
beginning
feel
this
nocturnal
existence
tell
destroying
nerve
start
own
shadow
and
full
all
sorts
horrible
imaginings
god
knows
that
there
ground
for
terrible
fear
this
accursed
place
looked
out
over
the
beautiful
expanse
bathed
soft
yellow
moonlight
till
was
almost
light
day
the
soft
light
the
distant
hills
became
melted
and
the
shadows
the
valleys
and
gorges
velvety
blackness
the
mere
beauty
seemed
cheer
there
was
peace
and
comfort
every
breath
drew
leaned
from
the
window
eye
was
caught
something
moving
storey
below
and
somewhat
left
where
imagined
from
the
order
the
rooms
that
the
windows
the
count
own
room
would
look
out
the
window
which
stood
was
tall
and
deep
stone
mullioned
and
though
weatherworn
was
still
complete
but
was
evidently
many
day
since
the
case
had
been
there
drew
back
behind
the
stonework
and
looked
carefully
out
what
saw
was
the
count
head
coming
out
from
the
window
did
not
see
the
face
but
knew
the
man
the
neck
and
the
movement
his
back
and
arms
any
case
could
not
mistake
the
hands
which
had
had
many
opportunities
studying
was
first
interested
and
somewhat
amused
for
wonderful
how
small
matter
will
interest
and
amuse
man
when
prisoner
but
very
feelings
changed
repulsion
and
terror
when
saw
the
whole
man
slowly
emerge
from
the
window
and
begin
crawl
down
the
castle
wall
over
that
dreadful
abyss
face
down
with
his
cloak
spreading
out
around
him
like
great
wings
first
could
not
believe
eyes
thought
was
some
trick
the
moonlight
some
weird
effect
shadow
but
kept
looking
and
could
delusion
saw
the
fingers
and
toes
grasp
the
corners
the
stones
worn
clear
the
mortar
the
stress
years
and
thus
using
every
projection
and
inequality
move
downwards
with
considerable
speed
just
lizard
moves
along
wall
what
manner
man
this
what
manner
creature
the
semblance
man
feel
the
dread
this
horrible
place
overpowering
fear
awful
fear
and
there
escape
for
encompassed
about
with
terrors
that
dare
not
think
may
once
more
have
seen
the
count
out
his
lizard
fashion
moved
downwards
sidelong
way
some
hundred
feet
down
and
good
deal
the
left
vanished
into
some
hole
window
when
his
head
had
disappeared
leaned
out
try
and
see
more
but
without
avail
the
distance
was
too
great
allow
proper
angle
sight
knew
had
left
the
castle
now
and
thought
use
the
opportunity
explore
more
than
had
dared
yet
went
back
the
room
and
taking
lamp
tried
all
the
doors
they
were
all
locked
had
expected
and
the
locks
were
comparatively
new
but
went
down
the
stone
stairs
the
hall
where
had
entered
originally
found
could
pull
back
the
bolts
easily
enough
and
unhook
the
great
chains
but
the
door
was
locked
and
the
key
was
gone
that
key
must
the
count
room
must
watch
should
his
door
unlocked
that
may
get
and
escape
went
make
thorough
examination
the
various
stairs
and
passages
and
try
the
doors
that
opened
from
them
one
two
small
rooms
near
the
hall
were
open
but
there
was
nothing
see
them
except
old
furniture
dusty
with
age
and
moth
eaten
last
however
found
one
door
the
top
the
stairway
which
though
seemed
locked
gave
little
under
pressure
tried
harder
and
found
that
was
not
really
locked
but
that
the
resistance
came
from
the
fact
that
the
hinges
had
fallen
somewhat
and
the
heavy
door
rested
the
floor
here
was
opportunity
which
might
not
have
again
exerted
myself
and
with
many
efforts
forced
back
that
could
enter
was
now
wing
the
castle
further
the
right
than
the
rooms
knew
and
storey
lower
down
from
the
windows
could
see
that
the
suite
rooms
lay
along
the
south
the
castle
the
windows
the
end
room
looking
out
both
west
and
south
the
latter
side
well
the
former
there
was
great
precipice
the
castle
was
built
the
corner
great
rock
that
three
sides
was
quite
impregnable
and
great
windows
were
placed
here
where
sling
bow
culverin
could
not
reach
and
consequently
light
and
comfort
impossible
position
which
had
guarded
were
secured
the
west
was
great
valley
and
then
rising
far
away
great
jagged
mountain
fastnesses
rising
peak
peak
the
sheer
rock
studded
with
mountain
ash
and
thorn
whose
roots
clung
cracks
and
crevices
and
crannies
the
stone
this
was
evidently
the
portion
the
castle
occupied
the
ladies
bygone
days
for
the
furniture
had
more
air
comfort
than
any
had
seen
the
windows
were
curtainless
and
the
yellow
moonlight
flooding
through
the
diamond
panes
enabled
one
see
even
colours
whilst
softened
the
wealth
dust
which
lay
over
all
and
disguised
some
measure
the
ravages
time
and
the
moth
lamp
seemed
little
effect
the
brilliant
moonlight
but
was
glad
have
with
for
there
was
dread
loneliness
the
place
which
chilled
heart
and
made
nerves
tremble
still
was
better
than
living
alone
the
rooms
which
had
come
hate
from
the
presence
the
count
and
after
trying
little
school
nerves
found
soft
quietude
come
over
here
sitting
little
oak
table
where
old
times
possibly
some
fair
lady
sat
pen
with
much
thought
and
many
blushes
her
ill
spelt
love
letter
and
writing
diary
shorthand
all
that
has
happened
since
closed
last
nineteenth
century
date
with
vengeance
and
yet
unless
senses
deceive
the
old
centuries
had
and
have
powers
their
own
which
mere
modernity
cannot
kill
later
the
morning
may
god
preserve
sanity
for
this
reduced
safety
and
the
assurance
safety
are
things
the
past
whilst
live
here
there
but
one
thing
hope
for
that
may
not
mad
indeed
not
mad
already
sane
then
surely
maddening
think
that
all
the
foul
things
that
lurk
this
hateful
place
the
count
the
least
dreadful
that
him
alone
can
look
for
safety
even
though
this
only
whilst
can
serve
his
purpose
great
god
merciful
god
let
calm
for
out
that
way
lies
madness
indeed
begin
get
new
lights
certain
things
which
have
puzzled
now
never
quite
knew
what
shakespeare
meant
when
made
hamlet
say
tablets
quick
tablets
tis
meet
that
put
down
etc
for
now
feeling
though
own
brain
were
unhinged
the
shock
had
come
which
must
end
its
undoing
turn
diary
for
repose
the
habit
entering
accurately
must
help
soothe
the
count
mysterious
warning
frightened
the
time
frightens
more
now
when
think
for
future
has
fearful
hold
upon
shall
fear
doubt
what
may
say
when
had
written
diary
and
had
fortunately
replaced
the
book
and
pen
pocket
felt
sleepy
the
count
warning
came
into
mind
but
took
pleasure
disobeying
the
sense
sleep
was
upon
and
with
the
obstinacy
which
sleep
brings
outrider
the
soft
moonlight
soothed
and
the
wide
expanse
without
gave
sense
freedom
which
refreshed
determined
not
return
night
the
gloom
haunted
rooms
but
sleep
here
where
old
ladies
had
sat
and
sung
and
lived
sweet
lives
whilst
their
gentle
breasts
were
sad
for
their
menfolk
away
the
midst
remorseless
wars
drew
great
couch
out
its
place
near
the
corner
that
lay
could
look
the
lovely
view
east
and
south
and
unthinking
and
uncaring
for
the
dust
composed
myself
for
sleep
suppose
must
have
fallen
asleep
hope
but
fear
for
all
that
followed
was
startlingly
real
real
that
now
sitting
here
the
broad
full
sunlight
the
morning
cannot
the
least
believe
that
was
all
sleep
was
not
alone
the
room
was
the
same
unchanged
any
way
since
came
into
could
see
along
the
floor
the
brilliant
moonlight
own
footsteps
marked
where
had
disturbed
the
long
accumulation
dust
the
moonlight
opposite
were
three
young
women
ladies
their
dress
and
manner
thought
the
time
that
must
dreaming
when
saw
them
for
though
the
moonlight
was
behind
them
they
threw
shadow
the
floor
they
came
close
and
looked
for
some
time
and
then
whispered
together
two
were
dark
and
had
high
aquiline
noses
like
the
count
and
great
dark
piercing
eyes
that
seemed
almost
red
when
contrasted
with
the
pale
yellow
moon
the
other
was
fair
fair
can
with
great
wavy
masses
golden
hair
and
eyes
like
pale
sapphires
seemed
somehow
know
her
face
and
know
connection
with
some
dreamy
fear
but
could
not
recollect
the
moment
how
where
all
three
had
brilliant
white
teeth
that
shone
like
pearls
against
the
ruby
their
voluptuous
lips
there
was
something
about
them
that
made
uneasy
some
longing
and
the
same
time
some
deadly
fear
felt
heart
wicked
burning
desire
that
they
would
kiss
with
those
red
lips
not
good
note
this
down
lest
some
day
should
meet
mina
eyes
and
cause
her
pain
but
the
truth
they
whispered
together
and
then
they
all
three
laughed
such
silvery
musical
laugh
but
hard
though
the
sound
never
could
have
come
through
the
softness
human
lips
was
like
the
intolerable
tingling
sweetness
water
glasses
when
played
cunning
hand
the
fair
girl
shook
her
head
coquettishly
and
the
other
two
urged
her
one
said
you
are
first
and
shall
follow
yours
the
right
begin
the
other
added
young
and
strong
there
are
kisses
for
all
lay
quiet
looking
out
under
eyelashes
agony
delightful
anticipation
the
fair
girl
advanced
and
bent
over
till
could
feel
the
movement
her
breath
upon
sweet
was
one
sense
honey
sweet
and
sent
the
same
tingling
through
the
nerves
her
voice
but
with
bitter
underlying
the
sweet
bitter
offensiveness
one
smells
blood
was
afraid
raise
eyelids
but
looked
out
and
saw
perfectly
under
the
lashes
the
girl
went
her
knees
and
bent
over
simply
gloating
there
was
deliberate
voluptuousness
which
was
both
thrilling
and
repulsive
and
she
arched
her
neck
she
actually
licked
her
lips
like
animal
till
could
see
the
moonlight
the
moisture
shining
the
scarlet
lips
and
the
red
tongue
lapped
the
white
sharp
teeth
lower
and
lower
went
her
head
the
lips
went
below
the
range
mouth
and
chin
and
seemed
about
fasten
throat
then
she
paused
and
could
hear
the
churning
sound
her
tongue
licked
her
teeth
and
lips
and
could
feel
the
hot
breath
neck
then
the
skin
throat
began
tingle
one
flesh
does
when
the
hand
that
tickle
approaches
nearer
nearer
could
feel
the
soft
shivering
touch
the
lips
the
super
sensitive
skin
throat
and
the
hard
dents
two
sharp
teeth
just
touching
and
pausing
there
closed
eyes
languorous
ecstasy
and
waited
waited
with
beating
heart
but
that
instant
another
sensation
swept
through
quick
lightning
was
conscious
the
presence
the
count
and
his
being
lapped
storm
fury
eyes
opened
involuntarily
saw
his
strong
hand
grasp
the
slender
neck
the
fair
woman
and
with
giant
power
draw
back
the
blue
eyes
transformed
with
fury
the
white
teeth
champing
with
rage
and
the
fair
cheeks
blazing
red
with
passion
but
the
count
never
did
imagine
such
wrath
and
fury
even
the
demons
the
pit
his
eyes
were
positively
blazing
the
red
light
them
was
lurid
the
flames
hell
fire
blazed
behind
them
his
face
was
deathly
pale
and
the
lines
were
hard
like
drawn
wires
the
thick
eyebrows
that
met
over
the
nose
now
seemed
like
heaving
bar
white
hot
metal
with
fierce
sweep
his
arm
hurled
the
woman
from
him
and
then
motioned
the
others
though
were
beating
them
back
was
the
same
imperious
gesture
that
had
seen
used
the
wolves
voice
which
though
low
and
almost
whisper
seemed
cut
through
the
air
and
then
ring
round
the
room
said
how
dare
you
touch
him
any
you
how
dare
you
cast
eyes
him
when
had
forbidden
back
tell
you
all
this
man
belongs
beware
how
you
meddle
with
him
you
have
deal
with
the
fair
girl
with
laugh
ribald
coquetry
turned
answer
him
you
yourself
never
loved
you
never
love
this
the
other
women
joined
and
such
mirthless
hard
soulless
laughter
rang
through
the
room
that
almost
made
faint
hear
seemed
like
the
pleasure
fiends
then
the
count
turned
after
looking
face
attentively
and
said
soft
whisper
yes
too
can
love
you
yourselves
can
tell
from
the
past
not
well
now
promise
you
that
when
done
with
him
you
shall
kiss
him
your
will
now
must
awaken
him
for
there
work
done
are
have
nothing
night
said
one
them
with
low
laugh
she
pointed
the
bag
which
had
thrown
upon
the
floor
and
which
moved
though
there
were
some
living
thing
within
for
answer
nodded
his
head
one
the
women
jumped
forward
and
opened
ears
did
not
deceive
there
was
gasp
and
low
wail
half
smothered
child
the
women
closed
round
whilst
was
aghast
with
horror
but
looked
they
disappeared
and
with
them
the
dreadful
bag
there
was
door
near
them
and
they
could
not
have
passed
without
noticing
they
simply
seemed
fade
into
the
rays
the
moonlight
and
pass
out
through
the
window
for
could
see
outside
the
dim
shadowy
forms
for
moment
before
they
entirely
faded
away
then
the
horror
overcame
and
sank
down
unconscious
chapter

harker
journal
continued
awoke
own
bed
that
had
not
dreamt
the
count
must
have
carried
here
tried
satisfy
myself
the
subject
but
could
not
arrive
any
unquestionable
result
sure
there
were
certain
small
evidences
such
that
clothes
were
folded
and
laid
manner
which
was
not
habit
watch
was
still
unwound
and
rigorously
accustomed
wind
the
last
thing
before
going
bed
and
many
such
details
but
these
things
are
proof
for
they
may
have
been
evidences
that
mind
was
not
usual
and
from
some
cause
another
had
certainly
been
much
upset
must
watch
for
proof
one
thing
glad
was
that
the
count
carried
here
and
undressed
must
have
been
hurried
his
task
for
pockets
are
intact
sure
this
diary
would
have
been
mystery
him
which
would
not
have
brooked
would
have
taken
destroyed
look
round
this
room
although
has
been
full
fear
now

sanctuary
for
nothing
can
more
dreadful
than
those
awful
women
who
were
who
are
waiting

blood
may
have
been
down
look
that
room
again
daylight
for
must
know
the
truth
when
got
the
doorway
the
top
the
stairs
found
closed
had
been
forcibly
driven
against
the
jamb
that
part
the
woodwork
was
splintered
could
see
that
the
bolt
the
lock
had
not
been
shot
but
the
door
fastened
from
the
inside
fear
was
dream
and
must
act
this
surmise
may
surely
the
toils
last
night
the
count
asked
the
suavest
tones
write
three
letters
one
saying
that
work
here
was
nearly
done
and
that
should
start
for
home
within
few
days
another
that
was
starting
the
next
morning
from
the
time
the
letter
and
the
third
that
had
left
the
castle
and
arrived
bistritz
would
fain
have
rebelled
but
felt
that
the
present
state
things
would
madness
quarrel
openly
with
the
count
whilst
absolutely
his
power
and
refuse
would
excite
his
suspicion
and
arouse
his
anger
knows
that
know
too
much
and
that
must
not
live
lest
dangerous
him
only
chance
prolong
opportunities
something
may
occur
which
will
give
chance
escape
saw
his
eyes
something
that
gathering
wrath
which
was
manifest
when
hurled
that
fair
woman
from
him
explained
that
posts
were
few
and
uncertain
and
that
writing
now
would
ensure
ease
mind
friends
and
assured
with
much
impressiveness
that
would
countermand
the
later
letters
which
would
held
over
bistritz
until
due
time
case
chance
would
admit
prolonging
stay
that
oppose
him
would
have
been
create
new
suspicion
therefore
pretended
fall
with
his
views
and
asked
him
what
dates
should
put
the
letters
calculated
minute
and
then
said
the
first
should
june
the
second
june
and
the
third

have
looked
one
from
you
and
friend
peter
hawkins
the
other
here
caught
sight
the
strange
symbols
opened
the
envelope
and
the
dark
look
came
into
his
face
and
his
eyes
blazed
wickedly
the
other
vile
thing
outrage
upon
friendship
and
hospitality
not
signed
well
cannot
matter
and
calmly
held
letter
and
envelope
the
flame
the
lamp
till
they
were
consumed
then
went
the
letter
hawkins
that
shall
course
send
since

letters
are
sacred

pardon
friend
that
unknowingly
did
break
the
seal

held
out
the
letter
and
with
courteous
bow
handed
clean
envelope
could
only
redirect
and
hand
him
silence
when
went
out
the
room
could
hear
the
key
turn
softly
minute
later
went
over
and
tried
and
the
door
was
locked
when
hour
two
after
the
count
came
quietly
into
the
room
his
coming
awakened
for
had
gone
sleep
the
sofa
was
very
courteous
and
very
cheery
his
manner
and
seeing
that
had
been
sleeping
said
friend
you
are
tired
get
bed
there
the
surest
rest
may
not
have
the
pleasure
talk
night
since
there
are
many
labours
but
you
will
sleep
pray
passed
room
and
went
bed
and
strange
say
slept
without
dreaming
despair
has
its
own
calms
may
this
morning
when
woke
thought
would
provide
myself
with
some
paper
and
envelopes
from
bag
and
keep
them
pocket
that
might
write
case
should
get
opportunity
but
again
surprise
again
shock
every
scrap
paper
was
gone
and
with
all
notes
memoranda
relating
railways
and
travel
letter
credit
fact
all
that
might
useful
were
once
outside
the
castle
sat
and
pondered
awhile
and
then
some
thought
occurred
and
made
search
portmanteau
and
the
wardrobe
where
had
placed
clothes
the
suit
which
had
travelled
was
gone
and
also
overcoat
and
rug
could
find
trace
them
anywhere
this
looked
like
some
new
scheme
villainy
june
this
morning
was
sitting
the
edge
bed
cudgelling
brains
heard
without
cracking
whips
and
pounding
and
scraping
horses
feet
the
rocky
path
beyond
the
courtyard
with
joy
hurried
the
window
and
saw
drive
into
the
yard
two
great
leiter
wagons
each
drawn
eight
sturdy
horses
and
the
head
each
pair
slovak
with
his
wide
hat
great
nail
studded
belt
dirty
sheepskin
and
high
boots
they
had
also
their
long
staves
hand
ran
the
door
intending
descend
and
try
and
join
them
through
the
main
hall
thought
that
way
might
opened
for
them
again
shock
door
was
fastened
the
outside
then
ran
the
window
and
cried
them
they
looked
stupidly
and
pointed
but
just
then
the
hetman
the
szgany
came
out
and
seeing
them
pointing
window
said
something
which
they
laughed
henceforth
effort
mine
piteous
cry
agonised
entreaty
would
make
them
even
look
they
resolutely
turned
away
the
leiter
wagons
contained
great
square
boxes
with
handles
thick
rope
these
were
evidently
empty
the
ease
with
which
the
slovaks
handled
them
and
their
resonance
they
were
roughly
moved
when
they
were
all
unloaded
and
packed
great
heap
one
corner
the
yard
the
slovaks
were
given
some
money
the
szgany
and
spitting
for
luck
lazily
went
each
his
horse
head
shortly
afterwards
heard
the
cracking
their
whips
die
away
the
distance
june
before
morning
last
night
the
count
left
early
and
locked
himself
into
his
own
room
soon
dared
ran
the
winding
stair
and
looked
out
the
window
which
opened
south
thought
would
watch
for
the
count
for
there
something
going
the
szgany
are
quartered
somewhere
the
castle
and
are
doing
work
some
kind
know
for
now
and
then
hear
far
away
muffled
sound
mattock
and
spade
and
whatever
must
the
end
some
ruthless
villainy
had
been
the
window
somewhat
less
than
half
hour
when
saw
something
coming
out
the
count
window
drew
back
and
watched
carefully
and
saw
the
whole
man
emerge
was
new
shock
find
that
had
the
suit
clothes
which
had
worn
whilst
travelling
here
and
slung
over
his
shoulder
the
terrible
bag
which
had
seen
the
women
take
away
there
could
doubt
his
quest
and
garb
too
this
then
his
new
scheme
evil
that
will
allow
others
see
they
think
that
may
both
leave
evidence
that
have
been
seen
the
towns
villages
posting
own
letters
and
that
any
wickedness
which
may
shall
the
local
people
attributed
makes
rage
think
that
this
can
and
whilst
shut
here
veritable
prisoner
but
without
that
protection
the
law
which
even
criminal
right
and
consolation
thought
would
watch
for
the
count
return
and
for
long
time
sat
doggedly
the
window
then
began
notice
that
there
were
some
quaint
little
specks
floating
the
rays
the
moonlight
they
were
like
the
tiniest
grains
dust
and
they
whirled
round
and
gathered
clusters
nebulous
sort
way
watched
them
with
sense
soothing
and
sort
calm
stole
over
leaned
back
the
embrasure
more
comfortable
position
that
could
enjoy
more
fully
the
aërial
gambolling
something
made
start
low
piteous
howling
dogs
somewhere
far
below
the
valley
which
was
hidden
from
sight
louder
seemed
ring
ears
and
the
floating
motes
dust
take
new
shapes
the
sound
they
danced
the
moonlight
felt
myself
struggling
awake
some
call
instincts
nay
very
soul
was
struggling
and
half
remembered
sensibilities
were
striving
answer
the
call
was
becoming
hypnotised
quicker
and
quicker
danced
the
dust
the
moonbeams
seemed
quiver
they
went
into
the
mass
gloom
beyond
more
and
more
they
gathered
till
they
seemed
take
dim
phantom
shapes
and
then
started
broad
awake
and
full
possession
senses
and
ran
screaming
from
the
place
the
phantom
shapes
which
were
becoming
gradually
materialised
from
the
moonbeams
were
those
the
three
ghostly
women
whom
was
doomed
fled
and
felt
somewhat
safer
own
room
where
there
was
moonlight
and
where
the
lamp
was
burning
brightly
when
couple
hours
had
passed
heard
something
stirring
the
count
room
something
like
sharp
wail
quickly
suppressed
and
then
there
was
silence
deep
awful
silence
which
chilled
with
beating
heart
tried
the
door
but
was
locked
prison
and
could
nothing
sat
down
and
simply
cried
sat
heard
sound
the
courtyard
without
the
agonised
cry
woman
rushed
the
window
and
throwing
peered
out
between
the
bars
there
indeed
was
woman
with
dishevelled
hair
holding
her
hands
over
her
heart
one
distressed
with
running
she
was
leaning
against
corner
the
gateway
when
she
saw
face
the
window
she
threw
herself
forward
and
shouted
voice
laden
with
menace
monster
give
child
she
threw
herself
her
knees
and
raising
her
hands
cried
the
same
words
tones
which
wrung
heart
then
she
tore
her
hair
and
beat
her
breast
and
abandoned
herself
all
the
violences
extravagant
emotion
finally
she
threw
herself
forward
and
though
could
not
see
her
could
hear
the
beating
her
naked
hands
against
the
door
somewhere
high
overhead
probably
the
tower
heard
the
voice
the
count
calling
his
harsh
metallic
whisper
his
call
seemed
answered
from
far
and
wide
the
howling
wolves
before
many
minutes
had
passed
pack
them
poured
like
pent
dam
when
liberated
through
the
wide
entrance
into
the
courtyard
there
was
cry
from
the
woman
and
the
howling
the
wolves
was
but
short
before
long
they
streamed
away
singly
licking
their
lips
could
not
pity
her
for
knew
now
what
had
become
her
child
and
she
was
better
dead
what
shall
what
can
how
can
escape
from
this
dreadful
thing

and
gloom
and
fear

night
how
sweet
and
how
dear

heart
and
eye

morning
can
when
the
sun
grew
high
this
morning
that
struck
the
top
the
great
gateway
opposite
window
the
high
spot
which
touched
seemed
the
dove
from
the
ark
had
lighted
there

from

been
vaporous
garment
which
dissolved

whilst

back
this
room
must
put
down
every
detail
order
went
whilst
courage
was
fresh
straight
the
window
the
south
side
and
once
got
outside
the
narrow
ledge
stone
which
runs
around
the
building
this
side
the
stones
are
big
and
roughly
cut
and
the
mortar
has
process
time
been
washed
away
between
them
took
off
boots
and
ventured
out
the
desperate
way
looked
down
once
make
sure
that
sudden
glimpse
the
awful
depth
would
not
overcome
but
after
that
kept
eyes
away
from
knew
pretty
well
the
direction
and
distance
the
count
window
and
made
for
well
could
having
regard
the
opportunities
available
did
not
feel
dizzy
suppose
was
too
excited
and
the
time
seemed
ridiculously
short
till
found
myself
standing
the
window
sill
and
trying
raise
the
sash
was
filled
with
agitation
however
when
bent
down
and
slid
feet
foremost
through
the
window
then
looked
around
for
the
count
but
with
surprise
and
gladness
made
discovery
the
room
was
empty
was
barely
furnished
with
odd
things
which
seemed
have
never
been
used
the
furniture
was
something
the
same
style
that
the
south
rooms
and
was
covered
with
dust
looked
for
the
key
but
was
not
the
lock
and
could
not
find
anywhere
the
only
thing
found
was
great
heap
gold
one
corner
gold
all
kinds
roman
and
british
and
austrian
and
hungarian
and
greek
and
turkish
money
covered
with
film
dust
though
had
lain
long
the
ground
none
that
noticed
was
less
than
three
hundred
years
old
there
were
also
chains
and
ornaments
some
jewelled
but
all
them
old
and
stained
one
corner
the
room
was
heavy
door
tried
for
since
could
not
find
the
key
the
room
the
key
the
outer
door
which
was
the
main
object
search
must
make
further
examination
all
efforts
would
vain
was
open
and
led
through
stone
passage
circular
stairway
which
went
steeply
down
descended
minding
carefully
where
went
for
the
stairs
were
dark
being
only
lit
loopholes
the
heavy
masonry
the
bottom
there
was
dark
tunnel
like
passage
through
which
came
deathly
sickly
odour
the
odour
old
earth
newly
turned
went
through
the
passage
the
smell
grew
closer
and
heavier
last
pulled
open
heavy
door
which
stood
ajar
and
found
myself
old
ruined
chapel
which
had
evidently
been
used
graveyard
the
roof
was
broken
and
two
places
were
steps
leading
vaults
but
the
ground
had
recently
been
dug
over
and
the
earth
placed
great
wooden
boxes
manifestly
those
which
had
been
brought
the
slovaks
there
was
nobody
about
and
made
search
for
any
further
outlet
but
there
was
none
then
went
over
every
inch
the
ground
not
lose
chance
went
down
even
into
the
vaults
where
the
dim
light
struggled
although
was
dread
very
soul
into
two
these
went
but
saw
nothing
except
fragments
old
coffins
and
piles
dust
the
third
however
made
discovery
there
one
the
great
boxes
which
there
were
fifty
all
pile
newly
dug
earth
lay
the
count
was
either
dead
asleep
could
not
say
which
for
the
eyes
were
open
and
stony
but
without
the
glassiness
death
and
the
cheeks
had
the
warmth
life
through
all
their
pallor
the
lips
were
red
ever
but
there
was
sign
movement
pulse
breath
beating
the
heart
bent
over
him
and
tried
find
any
sign
life
but
vain
could
not
have
lain
there
long
for
the
earthy
smell
would
have
passed
away
few
hours
the
side
the
box
was
its
cover
pierced
with
holes
here
and
there
thought
might
have
the
keys
him
but
when
went
search
saw
the
dead
eyes
and
them
dead
though
they
were
such
look
hate
though
unconscious
presence
that
fled
from
the
place
and
leaving
the
count
room
the
window
crawled
again
the
castle
wall
regaining
room
threw
myself
panting
upon
the
bed
and
tried
think
june
day
the
date
last
letter
and
the
count
has
taken
steps
prove
that
was
genuine
for
again
saw
him
leave
the
castle
the
same
window
and
clothes
went
down
the
wall
lizard
fashion
wished
had
gun
some
lethal
weapon
that
might
destroy
him
but
fear
that
weapon
wrought
alone
man
hand
would
have
any
effect
him
dared
not
wait
see
him
return
for
feared
see
those
weird
sisters
came
back
the
library
and
read
there
till
fell
asleep

awakened

count

the
howling

wolves

almost
the
sound
sprang
the
rising
his
hand
just
the
music
great
orchestra
seems
leap
under
the
bâton
the
conductor
after
pause
moment
proceeded
his
stately
way
the
door
drew
back
the
ponderous
bolts
unhooked
the
heavy
chains
and
began
draw
open
intense
astonishment
saw
that
was
unlocked
suspiciously
looked
all
round
but
could
see
key
any
kind
the
door
began
open
the
howling
the
wolves
without
grew
louder
and
angrier
their
red
jaws
with
champing
teeth
and
their
blunt
clawed
feet
they
leaped
came
through
the
opening
door
knew
then
that
struggle
the
moment
against
the
count
was
useless
with
such
allies
these
his
command
could
nothing
but
still
the
door
continued
slowly
open
and
only
the
count
body
stood
the
gap
suddenly
struck
that
this
might
the
moment
and
means
doom
was
given
the
wolves
and
own
instigation
there
was
diabolical
wickedness
the
idea
great
enough
for
the
count
and
last
chance
cried
out
shut
the
door
shall
wait
till
morning
and
covered
face
with
hands
hide
tears
bitter
disappointment
with
one
sweep
his
powerful
arm
the
count
threw
the
door
shut
and
the
great
bolts
clanged
and
echoed
through
the
hall
they
shot
back
into
their
places
silence
returned
the
library
and
after
minute
two
went
own
room
the
last
saw
count
dracula
was
his
kissing
his
hand
with
red
light
triumph
his
eyes
and
with
smile
that
judas
hell
might
proud
when
was
room
and
about
lie
down
thought
heard
whispering
door
went
softly
and
listened
unless
ears
deceived
heard
the
voice
the
count
back
back
your
own
place
your
time
not
yet
come
wait
have
patience
night
mine
morrow
night
yours
there
was
low
sweet
ripple
laughter
and
rage
threw
open
the
door
and
saw
without
the
three
terrible
women
licking
their
lips
appeared
they
all
joined
horrible
laugh
and
ran
away
came
back
room
and
threw
myself
knees
then
near
the
end
morrow
morrow
lord
help
and
those
whom
dear
june
morning
these
may
the
last
words
ever
write
this
diary
slept
till
just
before
the
dawn
and
when
woke
threw
myself
knees
for
determined
that
death
came
should
find
ready
last
felt
that
subtle
change
the
air
and
knew
that
the
morning
had
come
then
came
the
welcome
cock
crow
and
felt
that
was
safe
with
glad
heart
opened
door
and
ran
down
the
hall
had
seen
that
the
door
was
unlocked
and
now
escape
was
before
with
hands
that
trembled
with
eagerness
unhooked
the
chains
and
drew
back
the
massive
bolts
but
the
door
would
not
move
despair
seized
pulled
and
pulled
the
door
and
shook
till
massive
was
rattled
its
casement
could
see
the
bolt
shot
had
been
locked
after
left
the
count
then
wild
desire
took
obtain
that
key
any
risk
and
determined
then
and
there
scale
the
wall
again
and
gain
the
count
room
might
kill
but
death
now
seemed
the
happier
choice
evils
without
pause
rushed
the
east
window
and
scrambled
down
the
wall
before
into
the
count
room
was
empty
but
that
was
expected
could
not
see
key
anywhere
but
the
heap
gold
remained
went
through
the
door
the
corner
and
down
the
winding
stair
and
along
the
dark
passage
the
old
chapel
knew
now
well
enough
where
find
the
monster
sought
the
great
box
was
the
same
place
close
against
the
wall
but
the
lid
was
laid
not
fastened
down
but
with
the
nails
ready
their
places
hammered
home
knew
must
reach
the
body
for
the
key
raised
the
lid
and
laid
back
against
the
wall
and
then
saw
something
which
filled
very
soul
with
horror
there
lay
the
count
but
looking
his
youth
had
been
half
renewed
for
the
white
hair
and
moustache
were
changed
dark
iron
grey
the
cheeks
were
fuller
and
the
white
skin
seemed
ruby
red
underneath
the
mouth
was
redder
than
ever
for
the
lips
were
gouts
fresh
blood
which
trickled
from
the
corners
the
mouth
and
ran
over
the
chin
and
neck
even
the
deep
burning
eyes
seemed
set
amongst
swollen
flesh
for
the
lids
and
pouches
underneath
were
bloated
seemed
the
whole
awful
creature
were
simply
gorged
with
blood
lay
like
filthy
leech
exhausted
with
his
repletion
shuddered
bent
over
touch
him
and
every
sense
revolted
the
contact
but
had
search
was
lost
the
coming
night
might
see
own
body
banquet
similar
way
those
horrid
three
felt
all
over
the
body
but
sign
could
find
the
key
then
stopped
and
looked
the
count
there
was
mocking
smile
the
bloated
face
which
seemed
drive
mad
this
was
the
being
was
helping
transfer
london
where
perhaps
for
centuries
come
might
amongst
its
teeming
millions
satiate
his
lust
for
blood
and
create
new
and
ever
widening
circle
semi
demons
batten
the
helpless
the
very
thought
drove
mad
terrible
desire
came
upon
rid
the
world
such
monster
there
was
lethal
weapon
hand
but
seized
shovel
which
the
workmen
had
been
using
fill
the
cases
and
lifting
high
struck
with
the
edge
downward
the
hateful
face
but
did
the
head
turned
and
the
eyes
fell
full
upon
with
all
their
blaze
basilisk
horror
the
sight
seemed
paralyse
and
the
shovel
turned
hand
and
glanced
from
the
face
merely
making
deep
gash
above
the
forehead
the
shovel
fell
from
hand
across
the
box
and
pulled
away
the
flange
the
blade
caught
the
edge
the
lid
which
fell
over
again
and
hid
the
horrid
thing
from
sight
the
last
glimpse
had
was
the
bloated
face
blood
stained
and
fixed
with
grin
malice
which
would
have
held
its
own
the
nethermost
hell
thought
and
thought
what
should
next
move
but
brain
seemed
fire
and
waited
with
despairing
feeling
growing
over
waited
heard
the
distance
gipsy
song
sung
merry
voices
coming
closer
and
through
their
song
the
rolling
heavy
wheels
and
the
cracking
whips
the
szgany
and
the
slovaks
whom
the
count
had
spoken
were
coming
with
last
look
around
and
the
box
which
contained
the
vile
body
ran
from
the
place
and
gained
the
count
room
determined
rush
out
the
moment
the
door
should
opened
with
strained
ears
listened
and
heard
downstairs
the
grinding
the
key
the
great
lock
and
the
falling
back
the
heavy
door
there
must
have
been
some
other
means
entry
some
one
had
key
for
one
the
locked
doors
then
there
came
the
sound
many
feet
tramping
and
dying
away
some
passage
which
sent
clanging
echo
turned
run
down
again
towards
the
vault
where
might
find
the
new
entrance
but
the
moment
there
seemed
come
violent
puff
wind
and
the
door
the
winding
stair
blew
with
shock
that
set
the
dust
from
the
lintels
flying
when
ran
push
open
found
that
was
hopelessly
fast
was
again
prisoner
and
the
net
doom
was
closing
round
more
closely
write
there
the
passage
below
sound
many
tramping
feet
and
the
crash
weights
being
set
down
heavily
doubtless
the
boxes
with
their
freight
earth
there
sound
hammering
the
box
being
nailed
down
now
can
hear
the
heavy
feet
tramping
again
along
the
hall
with
many
other
idle
feet
coming
behind
them
the
door
shut
and
the
chains
rattle
there
grinding
the
key
the
lock
can
hear
the
key
withdraw
then
another
door
opens
and
shuts
hear
the
creaking
lock
and
bolt
hark
the
courtyard
and
down
the
rocky
way
the
roll
heavy
wheels
the
crack
whips
and
the
chorus
the
szgany

pass
into
the
distance

him
john

lunatic
asylum
man
with
the
strong
jaw
and
the
good
forehead
was
very
cool
outwardly
but
was
nervous
all
the
same
had
evidently
been
schooling
himself
all
sorts
little
things
and
remembered
them
but
almost
managed
sit
down
his
silk
hat
which
men
don
generally
when
they
are
cool
and
then
when
wanted
appear
ease
kept
playing
with
lancet
way
that
made
nearly
scream
spoke
mina
very
straightforwardly
told
how
dear
was
him
though
had
known
little
and
what
his
life
would
with
help
and
cheer
him
was
going
tell
how
unhappy
would
did
not
care
for
him
but
when
saw
cry
said
that
was
brute
and
would
not
add
present
trouble
then
broke
off
and
asked
could
love
him
time
and
when
shook
head
his
hands
trembled
and
then
with
some
hesitation
asked
cared
already
for
any
one
else
put
very
nicely
saying
that
did
not
want
wring
confidence
from
but
only
know
because
woman
heart
was
free
man
might
have
hope
and
then
mina
felt
sort
duty
tell
him
that
there
was
some
one
only
told
him
that
much
and
then
stood
and
looked
very
strong
and
very
grave
took
both
hands
his
and
said
hoped
would
happy
and
that
ever
wanted
friend
must
count
him
one
best
mina

help
crying
and
you
must
excuse
this
letter
being
all
blotted
being
proposed
all
very
nice
and
all
that
sort
thing
but
isn
all
happy
thing
when
you
have
see
poor
fellow
whom
you
know
loves
you
honestly
going
away
and
looking
all
broken
hearted
and
know
that
matter

may
say
the
moment
you
are
passing
quite
out
his
life
dear
must
stop

miserable
though
happy
evening
arthur
has
just
gone
and
feel
better

about
the
day
well
dear
number
two
came
after
lunch
such
nice
fellow
american
from
texas
and
looks
young
and
fresh
that
seems
almost
impossible
that
has
been
many
places
and
has
had
such
adventures
sympathise
with
poor
desdemona
when
she
had
such
dangerous
stream
poured
her
ear
even
black
man
suppose
that
women
are
such
cowards
that
think
man
will
save
from
fears
and
marry
him
know
now
what
would
were
man
and
wanted
make
girl
love
don
for
there
was
morris
telling
his
stories
and
arthur
never
told
any
and
yet
dear
somewhat
previous
quincey
morris
found
alone
seems
that
man
always
does
find
girl
alone
doesn
for
arthur
tried
twice
make
chance
and
helping
him
all
could
not
ashamed
say
now
must
tell
you
beforehand
that
morris
doesn
always
speak
slang
that
say
never
does
strangers
before
them
for
really
well
educated
and
has
exquisite
manners
but
found
out

looked
happy
and
jolly

but
could
see
all
the
same
that

very
nervous
took
hand
his
and
said
ever
sweetly
miss

seven
young

with

won
you
just
hitch
alongside

let
down
the
long
road
together
driving
double
harness
well
did
look
good
humoured
and
jolly
that
didn
seem
half
hard
refuse
him
did
poor
seward
said
lightly
could
that
did
not
know
anything
hitching
and
that
wasn
broken
harness
all
yet
then
said
that
had
spoken
light
manner
and
hoped
that
had
made
mistake
doing
grave
momentous
occasion
for
him
would
forgive
him
really
did
look
serious
when
was
saying
and
couldn
help
feeling
bit
serious
too
know
mina
you
will
think
horrid
flirt
though
couldn
help
feeling
sort
exultation
that
was
number
two
one
day
and
then
dear
before
could
say
word
began
pouring
out
perfect
torrent
love
making
laying
his
very
heart
and
soul
feet
looked
earnest
over
that
shall
never
again
think
that
man
must
playful
always
and
never
earnest
because
merry
times
suppose
saw
something
face
which
checked
him
for
suddenly
stopped
and
said
with
sort
manly
fervour
that
could
have
loved
him
for
had
been
free
lucy
you
are
honest
hearted
girl
know
should

one
good
fellow
another

almost
making

this
great
hearted
true
gentleman
burst
into
tears
afraid
dear
you
will
think
this
very
sloppy
letter
more
ways
than
one
and
really
felt
very
badly
why
can
they
let
girl
marry
three
men
many
want
her
and
save
all
this
trouble
but
this
heresy
and
must
not
say
glad

them
into
his
and
said
hearty
way

are
walks
with

and
people
and
sit
there
all

looking

three

nothing

sit
here
and

the

below
with
the

side
one
long
granite
wall
stretching
out
into
the

with
curve

the

the

which
lighthouse
heavy
sea
wall
runs
along

the

the

wall
makes
elbow
crooked
inversely
and
its
end
too
has
lighthouse
between
the
two
piers
there
narrow
opening
into
the
harbour
which
then
suddenly
widens
nice
high
water
but
when
the
tide
out
shoals
away
nothing
and
there
merely
the
stream
the

running
between

with

here
and
there
outside

this
side
there
rises
for
about

sharp
edge

runs

the

buoy
with

such
curious
turns
that
sometimes

abnormally
cruel
his

are
odd

just
now
his

has
present
such
quantity
that

several
very
big
fellows
box
keeps
feeding
them
with
his

the
number

becoming
sensibly
diminished

used
half
his

attracting
more
flies
from
outside
his
room
july
his
spiders
are
now
becoming
great
nuisance
his
flies
and
day
told
him
that

and
before
knew
what
was
going
put
his
mouth
and
ate
scolded
him
for
but
argued
quietly
that
was
very
good
and
very
wholesome
that
was

and
gave
life
him
this
gave
idea
the

his
salvation
depended
upon

firm
however
and

found
him

see
him
the
morning
early
july
visited
renfield
very
early
before
the
attendant
went
his
rounds
found
him
and
humming
tune
was
spreading
out
his
sugar
which
had
saved
the
window
and
was
manifestly
beginning
his
fly
catching
again
and
beginning
cheerfully
and
with
good
grace
looked
around
for
his
birds
and
not
seeing
them
asked
him
where
they
were
replied
without
turning
round
that
they
had
all
flown
away
there
were
few
feathers
about
the
room
and
his

said
nothing
but
went
and
told
the
keeper

there
were
anything
odd
about
him
during
the
day
the

has
just
been

not
heard
from

and
fall
over
with
despairing
cry
that
echoes
all
over
the
place
poor

naturally
anxious
about
lucy
and

she
will
all
right
when

news
from

quite
uneasy
about
him
though
why
should
not
know
but
wish
that

only
single
line
lucy
walks
more
than
ever
and
each
night
awakened
her
moving
about
the
room
fortunately
the
weather
hot
that
she
cannot
get
cold
but
still
the
anxiety

perpetually
being
wakened

frets
the
postponement
seeing
him

does
not
touch
her
looks
she
trifle
stouter
and
her
cheeks
are
lovely
rose
pink
she
has
lost
that
anæmic
look
which
she
had
pray
will
all
last
august
another
week
gone
and
news
from
jonathan
not
even
hawkins
from
whom
have
heard
hope
not
ill
surely
would
have
written
look
that
last
letter
his
but
somehow
does
not
satisfy
does
not
read
like
him
and
yet
his
writing
there
mistake
that
lucy
has
not
walked
much
her
sleep
the
last
week
but
there
odd
concentration
about
her
which
not
understand
even
her
sleep
she
seems
watching
she
tries
the
door
and
finding
locked
goes
about
the
room
searching
for
the
key
august
another
three
days
and

this
suspense
getting
dreadful
only
knew
where
write
where
should
feel
easier

last
letter
must
only
pray
god
for
patience
lucy
more
excitable
than
ever

all
the
time
kept
looking
strange
ship

make
her
out
said
she
russian
the
look
her
but
she
knocking
about
the
queerest
way
she
doesn
know
her
mind
bit
she
seems
see
the
storm
coming
but
can
decide
whether
run
north
the
open
put
here
look
there
again
she
steered
mighty
strangely
for
she
doesn
mind
the

from
correspondent
whitby
one
the
greatest
and
suddenest
storms
record
has
just
been
experienced
here
with
results
both
strange
and
unique
the
weather
had
been
somewhat
sultry
but
not
any
degree
uncommon
the
month
august
saturday
evening
was
fine
was
ever
known
and
the
great
body
holiday
makers
laid
out
yesterday
for
visits
mulgrave
woods
robin
hood
bay
rig
mill
runswick
staithes
and
the
various
trips
the
neighbourhood
whitby
the
steamers
emma
and
scarborough
made
trips
and
down
the
coast
and
there
was
unusual
amount
tripping
both
and
from
whitby
the
day
was
unusually
fine
till
the
afternoon
when
some
the
gossips
who
frequent
the
east
cliff
churchyard
and
from
that
commanding
eminence
watch
the
wide
sweep
sea
visible
the
north
and
east
called
attention
sudden
show
mares
tails
high
the
sky
the
north
west
the
wind
was
then
blowing
from
the
south
west
the
mild
degree
which
barometrical
language
ranked
light
breeze
the
coastguard
duty
once
made
report
and
one
old
fisherman
who
for
more
than
half
century
has
kept
watch
weather
signs
from
the
east
cliff
foretold
emphatic
manner
the
coming
sudden
storm
the
approach
sunset
was
very
beautiful
grand
its
masses
splendidly
coloured
clouds
that
there
was
quite
assemblage
the
walk
along
the
cliff
the
old
churchyard
enjoy
the
beauty
before
the
sun
dipped
below
the
black
mass
kettleness
standing
boldly
athwart
the
western
sky
its
downward
way
was
marked
myriad
clouds
every
sunset
colour
flame
purple
pink
green
violet
and
all
the
tints
gold
with
here
and
there
masses
not
large
but
seemingly
absolute
blackness
all
sorts
shapes
well
outlined
colossal
silhouettes
the
experience
was
not
lost
the
painters
and
doubtless
some
the
sketches
the
prelude
the
great
storm
will
grace
the
and
walls
may
next
more
than
one
captain
made
his
mind
then
and
there
that
his
cobble
his
mule
they
term
the
different
classes
boats
would
remain
the
harbour
till
the
storm
had
passed
the
wind
fell
away
entirely
during
the
evening
and
midnight
there
was
dead
calm
sultry
heat
and
that
prevailing
intensity
which
the
approach
thunder
affects
persons
sensitive
nature
there
were
but
few
lights
sight
sea
for
even
the
coasting
steamers
which
usually
hug
the
shore
closely
kept
well
seaward
and
but
few
fishing
boats
were
sight
the
only
sail
noticeable
was
foreign
schooner
with
all
sails
set
which
was
seemingly
going
westwards
the
foolhardiness
ignorance
her
officers
was
prolific
theme
for
comment
whilst
she
remained
sight
and
efforts
were
made
signal
her
reduce
sail
face
her
danger
before
the
night
shut
down
she
was
seen
with
sails
idly
flapping
she
gently
rolled
the
undulating
swell
the
sea
idle
painted
ship
upon
painted
ocean
shortly
before
ten
clock
the
stillness
the
air
grew
quite
oppressive
and
the
silence
was
marked
that
the
bleating
sheep
inland
the
barking
dog
the
town
was
distinctly
heard
and
the
band
the
pier
with
its
lively
french
air
was
like
discord
the
great
harmony
nature
silence
little
after
midnight
came
strange
sound
from
over
the
sea
and
high
overhead
the
air
began
carry
strange
faint
hollow
booming
then
without
warning
the
tempest
broke
with
rapidity
which
the
time
seemed
incredible
and
even
afterwards
impossible
realize
the
whole
aspect
nature
once
became
convulsed
the
waves
rose
growing
fury
each
overtopping
its
fellow
till
very
few
minutes
the
lately
glassy
sea
was
like
roaring
and
devouring
monster
white
crested
waves
beat
madly
the
level
sands
and
rushed
the
shelving
cliffs
others
broke
over
the
piers
and
with
their
spume
swept
the
lanthorns
the
lighthouses
which
rise
from
the
end
either
pier
whitby
harbour
the
wind
roared
like
thunder
and
blew
with
such
force
that
was
with
difficulty
that
even
strong
men
kept
their
feet
clung
with
grim
clasp
the
iron
stanchions
was
found
necessary
clear
the
entire
piers
from
the
mass
onlookers
else
the
fatalities
the
night
would
have
been
increased
manifold
add
the
difficulties
and
dangers
the
time
masses
sea
fog
came
drifting
inland
white
wet
clouds
which
swept
ghostly
fashion
dank
and
damp
and
cold
that
needed
but
little
effort
imagination
think
that
the
spirits
those
lost
sea
were
touching
their
living
brethren
with
the
clammy
hands
death
and
many
one
shuddered
the
wreaths
sea
mist
swept
times
the
mist
cleared
and
the
sea
for
some
distance
could
seen
the
glare
the
lightning
which
now
came
thick
and
fast
followed
such
sudden
peals
thunder
that
the
whole
sky
overhead
seemed
trembling
under
the
shock
the
footsteps
the
storm
some
the
scenes
thus
revealed
were
immeasurable
grandeur
and
absorbing
interest
the
sea
running
mountains
high
threw
skywards
with
each
wave
mighty
masses
white
foam
which
the
tempest
seemed
snatch
and
whirl
away
into
space
here
and
there
fishing
boat
with
rag
sail
running
madly
for
shelter
before
the
blast
now
and
again
the
white
wings
storm
tossed
sea
bird
the
summit
the
east
cliff
the
new
searchlight
was
ready
for
experiment
but
had
not
yet
been
tried
the
officers
charge
got
into
working
order
and
the
pauses
the
inrushing
mist
swept
with
the
surface
the
sea
once
twice
its
service
was
most
effective
when
fishing
boat
with
gunwale
under
water
rushed
into
the
harbour
able
the
guidance
the
sheltering
light
avoid
the
danger
dashing
against
the
piers
each
boat
achieved
the
safety
the
port
there
was
shout
joy
from
the
mass
people
shore
shout
which
for
moment
seemed
cleave
the
gale
and
was
then
swept
away
its
rush
before
long
the
searchlight
discovered
some
distance
away
schooner
with
all
sails
set
apparently
the
same
vessel
which
had
been
noticed
earlier
the
evening
the
wind
had
this
time
backed
the
east
and
there
was
shudder
amongst
the
watchers
the
cliff
they
realized
the
terrible
danger
which
she
now
was
between
her
and
the
port
lay
the
great
flat
reef
which
many
good
ships
have
from
time
time
suffered
and
with
the
wind
blowing
from
its
present
quarter
would
quite
impossible
that
she
should
fetch
the
entrance
the
harbour
was
now
nearly
the
hour
high
tide
but
the
waves
were
great
that
their
troughs
the
shallows
the
shore
were
almost
visible
and
the
schooner
with
all
sails
set
was
rushing
with
such
speed
that
the
words
one
old
salt
she
must
fetch
somewhere
was
only
hell
then
came
another
rush
sea
fog
greater
than
any
hitherto
mass
dank
mist
which
seemed
close
all
things
like
grey
pall
and
left
available
men
only
the
organ
hearing
for
the
roar
the
tempest
and
the
crash
the
thunder
and
the
booming
the
mighty
billows
came
through
the
damp
oblivion
even
louder
than
before
the
rays
the
searchlight
were
kept
fixed
the
harbour
mouth
across
the
east
pier
where
the
shock
was
expected
and
men
waited
breathless
the
wind
suddenly
shifted
the
north
east
and
the
remnant
the
sea
fog
melted
the
blast
and
then
mirabile
dictu
between
the
piers
leaping
from
wave
wave
rushed
headlong
speed
swept
the
strange
schooner
before
the
blast
with
all
sail
set
and
gained
the
safety
the
harbour
the
searchlight
followed
her
and
shudder
ran
through
all
who
saw
her
for
lashed
the
helm
was
corpse
with
drooping
head
which
swung
horribly
and
fro
each
motion
the
ship
other
form
could
seen
deck
all
great
awe
came
all
they
realised
that
the
ship
miracle
had
found
the
harbour
unsteered
save
the
hand
dead
man
however
all
took
place
more
quickly
than
takes
write
these
words
the
schooner
paused
not
but
rushing
across
the
harbour
pitched
herself
that
accumulation
sand
and
gravel
washed
many
tides
and
many
storms
into
the
south
east
corner
the
pier
jutting
under
the
east
cliff
known
locally
tate
hill
pier
there
was
course
considerable
concussion
the
vessel
drove
the
sand
heap
every
spar
rope
and
stay
was
strained
and
some
the
top
hammer
came
crashing
down
but
strangest
all
the
very
instant
the
shore
was
touched
immense
dog
sprang
deck
from
below
shot
the
concussion
and
running
forward
jumped
from
the
bow
the
sand
making
straight
for
the
steep
cliff
where
the
churchyard
hangs
over
the
laneway
the
east
pier
steeply
that
some
the
flat
tombstones
thruff
steans
through
stones
they
call
them
the
whitby
vernacular
actually
project
over
where
the
sustaining
cliff
has
fallen
away
disappeared
the
darkness
which
seemed
intensified
just
beyond
the
focus
the
searchlight
happened
that
there
was
one
the
moment
tate
hill
pier
all
those
whose
houses
are
close
proximity
were
either
bed
were
out
the
heights
above
thus
the
coastguard
duty
the
eastern
side
the
harbour
who
once
ran
down
the
little
pier
was
the
first
climb
board
the
men
working
the
searchlight
after
scouring
the
entrance
the
harbour
without
seeing
anything
then
turned
the
light
the
derelict
and
kept
there
the
coastguard
ran
aft
and
when
came
beside
the
wheel
bent
over
examine
and
recoiled
once
though
under
some
sudden
emotion
this
seemed
pique
general
curiosity
and
quite
number
people
began
run
good
way
round
from
the
west
cliff
the
drawbridge
tate
hill
pier
but
your
correspondent
fairly
good
runner
and
came
well
ahead
the
crowd
when
arrived
however
found
already
assembled
the
pier
crowd
whom
the
coastguard
and
police
refused
allow
come
board
the
courtesy
the
chief
boatman
was
your
correspondent
permitted
climb
deck
and
was
one
small
group
who
saw
the
dead
seaman
whilst
actually
lashed
the
wheel
was
wonder
that
the
coastguard
was
surprised
even
awed
for
not
often
can
such
sight
have
been
seen
the
man
was
simply
fastened
his
hands
tied
one
over
the
other
spoke
the
wheel
between
the
inner
hand
and
the
wood
was
crucifix
the
set
beads
which
was
fastened
being
around
both
wrists
and
wheel
and
all
kept
fast
the
binding
cords
the
poor
fellow
may
have
been
seated
one
time
but
the
flapping
and
buffeting
the
sails
had
worked
through
the
rudder
the
wheel
and
dragged
him
and
fro
that
the
cords
with
which
was
tied
had
cut
the
flesh
the
bone
accurate
note
was
made
the
state
things
and
doctor
surgeon
caffyn
east
elliot
place
who
came
immediately
after
declared
after
making
examination
that
the
man
must
have
been
dead
for
quite
two
days
his
pocket
was
bottle
carefully
corked
empty
save
for
little
roll
paper
which
proved
the
addendum
the
log
the
coastguard
said
the
man
must
have
tied
his
own
hands
fastening
the
knots
with
his
teeth
the
fact
that
coastguard
was
the
first
board
may
save
some
complications
later
the
admiralty
court
for
coastguards
cannot
claim
the
salvage
which
the
right
the
first
civilian
entering
derelict
already
however
the
legal
tongues
are
wagging
and
one
young
law
student
loudly
asserting
that
the
rights
the
owner
are
already
completely
sacrificed
his
property
being
held
contravention
the
statutes
mortmain
since
the
tiller
emblemship
not
proof
delegated

needless
say
that
the

has
been
reverently
removed
from

where
held
his
honourable
watch
and
ward
till
death

the
sudden

its
fierceness
abating

nothing
talked
about

day
except
the
strange
coincidence
the
officials
the
board

have
been
most
exacting
seeing
that
every
compliance
has
been
made
with
existing
regulations
the

nine

they

evidently
determined
that

concerning

when

more
than

however

entirely
from

that
was
frightened
and
made
its
way
the
moors
where
still
hiding
terror
there
are
some
who
look
with
dread
such
possibility

later

rushed
deck
his
flannels
looked
wild
eyed
and
haggard
and
greatly
fear
his
reason
has
given

came
close
and
whispered
hoarsely
with
his
mouth
ear
though
fearing
the
very
air
might
hear
here
know
now
the
watch
last
night
saw
like
man
tall
and
thin
and
ghastly
pale
was
the
bows
and
looking
out
crept
behind
and
gave
knife
but
the
knife
went
through
empty
the
air
and
spoke
took
his
knife
and
drove
savagely
into
space
then
went
but
here
and
find
the
hold
perhaps
one
those
boxes
unscrew
them
one
one
and
see
you
work
the
helm
and
with
warning
look
and
his
finger
his
lip
went
below
there
was
springing
choppy
wind
and
could
not
leave
the
helm
saw
him
come
out
deck
again
with
tool
chest
and
lantern
and
down
the

hatchway
mad

and
pull
them
about

thing
can
here
stay
and
mind
the
helm
and
write
these
notes
can
only
trust
god
and
wait
till
the
fog
clears
then
can
steer
any
harbour
with
the
wind
that
shall
cut
down
sails
and
lie
and
signal
for
help
nearly
all
over
now
just
was
beginning
hope
that
the
mate
would
come
out
calmer
for
heard
him
knocking
away
something
the
hold
and
work
good
for
him
there
came
the
hatchway
sudden
startled
scream
which
made
blood
run
cold
and
the
deck
came
shot
from
gun
raging
madman
with
his
eyes
rolling
and
his
face
convulsed
with
fear
save
save
cried
and
then
looked
round
the
blanket
fog
his
horror
turned
despair
and
steady
voice
said
you
had
better
come
too
captain
before
too
late
there
know
the
secret
now
the

will
save
from
him
and
all
that
left
before
could
say
word
move
forward
seize
him
sprang
the
bulwark
and
deliberately
threw
himself
into
the
sea

know
the
secret
too
now
was
this
madman
who
had
got
rid
the

and
now
has
followed
them
himself

the

and
whether
not
the
man
himself
committed
the
murders
there
now
none
say
the

hold
almost
universally
that

august
lucy
was
very
restless
all
night
and
too
could
not
sleep
the
storm
was
fearful
and
boomed
loudly
among
the
chimney
pots
made
shudder
when
sharp
puff
came
seemed
like
distant
gun
strangely
enough
lucy
did
not
wake
but
she
got
twice
and
dressed
herself
fortunately
each
time
awoke
time
and
managed
undress
her
without
waking
her
and
got
her
back
bed
very
strange
thing
this
sleep
walking
for
soon
her
will
thwarted
any
physical
way
her
intention
there
any
disappears
and
she
yields
herself
almost
exactly
the
routine
her
life
early
the
morning
both
got
and
went
down
the
harbour
see
anything
had
happened
the
night
there
were
very
few
people
about
and
though
the
sun
was
bright
and
the
air
clear
and
fresh
the
big
grim
looking
waves
that
seemed
dark
themselves
because
the
foam
that
topped
them
was
like
snow
forced
themselves
through
the
narrow
mouth
the
harbour
like
bullying
man
going
through
crowd
somehow
felt
glad
that
jonathan
was
not
the
sea
last
night
but
land
but
land
sea
where
and
how
getting
fearfully
anxious
about
him
only
knew
what
and
could
anything
august
the
funeral
the
poor
sea
captain
day
was
most
touching
every
boat
the
harbour
seemed
there
and
the
coffin
was
carried
captains
all
the
way
from
tate
hill
pier
the
churchyard
lucy
came
with
and
went
early
our
old
seat
whilst
the
cortege
boats
went
the
river
the
viaduct
and
came
down
again
had
lovely
view
and
saw
the
procession
nearly
all
the
way
the
poor
fellow
was
laid
rest
quite
near
our
seat
that
stood
when
the
time
came
and
saw
everything
poor
lucy
seemed
much
upset
she
was
restless
and
uneasy
all
the
time
and
cannot
but
think
that
her
dreaming
night
telling
her
she
quite
odd
one
thing
she
will
not
admit
that
there
any
cause
for
restlessness
there
she
does
not
understand
herself
there
additional
cause
that
poor
old
swales
was
found
dead
this
morning
our
seat
his
neck
being
broken
had
evidently
the
doctor
said
fallen
back
the
seat
some
sort
fright
for
there
was
look
fear
and
horror
his
face
that
the
men
said
made
them
shudder
poor
dear
old
man
perhaps
had
seen
death
with
his
dying
eyes
lucy
sweet
and
sensitive
that
she
feels
influences
more
acutely
than
other
people
just
now
she
was
quite
upset
little
thing
which
did
not
much
heed
though
myself
very
fond
animals
one
the
men
who
came
here
often
look
for
the
boats
was
followed
his
dog
the
dog
always
with
him
they
are
both
quiet
persons
and
never
saw
the
man
angry
nor
heard
the
dog
bark
during
the
service
the
dog
would
not
come
its
master
who
was
the
seat
with
but
kept
few
yards
off
barking
and
howling
its
master
spoke
gently
and
then
harshly
and
then
angrily
but
would
neither
come
nor
cease
make
noise
was
sort
fury
with
its
eyes
savage
and
all
its
hairs
bristling
out
like
cat
tail
when
puss
the
war
path
finally
the
man
too
got
angry
and
jumped
down
and
kicked
the
dog
and
then
took
the
scruff
the
neck
and
half
dragged
and
half
threw
the
tombstone
which
the
seat
fixed
the
moment
touched
the
stone
the
poor
thing
became
quiet
and
fell
all
into
tremble
did
not
try
get
away
but
crouched
down
quivering
and
cowering
and
was
such
pitiable
state
terror
that
tried
though
without
effect
comfort
lucy
was
full
pity
too
but
she
did
not
attempt
touch
the
dog
but
looked
agonised
sort
way
greatly
fear
that
she
too

through
the
world
without
trouble
she
will

sat
with
horrible

upon
and
some
feeling
emptiness
around
the

was
dark
could
not

stole
across
and
felt
for

the

was

and
found
that

and
got

struck
that
the

she
wore
might

and
looked
the

then
looked
all
the

rooms
the

with

finally
came
the

and
found

open
but
the
catch
the
lock
had
not
caught
the
people
the

are
careful
lock
the
door
every
night
feared
that
lucy
must
have
gone
out
she
was
there
was
time
think
what
might
happen
vague
overmastering
fear
obscured
all
details
took
big
heavy
shawl
and
ran
out
the
clock
was
striking
one
was
the
crescent
and
there
was
not
soul
sight
ran
along
the
north
terrace
but
could
see
sign
the
white
figure
which
expected
the
edge
the
west
cliff
above
the
pier
looked
across
the
harbour
the
east
cliff
the
hope
fear
don
know
which
seeing
lucy
our
favourite
seat
there
was
bright
full
moon
with
heavy
black
driving
clouds
which
threw
the
whole
scene
into
fleeting
diorama
light
and
shade
they
sailed
across
for
moment
two
could
see
nothing
the
shadow
cloud
obscured
mary
church
and
all
around
then
the
cloud
passed
could
see
the
ruins
the
abbey
coming
into
view
and
the
edge
narrow
band
light
sharp
sword
cut
moved
along
the
church
and
the
churchyard
became
gradually
visible
whatever
expectation
was
was
not
disappointed
for
there
our
favourite
seat
the
silver
light
the
moon
struck
half
reclining
figure
snowy
white
the
coming
the
cloud
was
too
quick
for
see
much
for
shadow
shut
down
light
almost
immediately
but
seemed
though
something
dark
stood
behind
the
seat
where
the
white
figure
shone
and
bent
over
what
was
whether
man
beast
could
not
tell
did
not
wait
catch
another
glance
but
flew
down
the
steep
steps
the
pier
and
along
the
fish
market
the
bridge
which
was
the
only
way
reach
the
east
cliff
the
town
seemed
dead
for
not
soul
did
see
rejoiced
that
was
for
wanted
witness
poor
lucy
condition
the
time
and
distance
seemed
endless
and
knees
trembled
and
breath
came
laboured
toiled
the
endless
steps
the
abbey
must
have
gone
fast
and
yet
seemed
feet
were
weighted
with
lead
and
though
every
joint
body
were
rusty
when
got
almost
the
top
could
see
the
seat
and
the
white
figure
for
was
now
close
enough
distinguish
even
through
the
spells
shadow
there
was
undoubtedly
something
long
and
black
bending
over
the
half
reclining
white
figure
called
fright
lucy
lucy
and
something
raised
head
and
from
where
was
could
see
white
face
and
red
gleaming
eyes
lucy
did
not
answer
and
ran
the
entrance
the
churchyard
entered
the
church
was
between
and
the
seat
and
for
minute
lost
sight
her
when
came
view
again
the
cloud
had
passed
and
the
moonlight
struck
brilliantly
that
could
see
lucy
half
reclining
with
her
head
lying
over
the
back
the
seat
she
was
quite
alone
and
there
was
not
sign
any
living
thing
about
when
bent
over
her
could
see
that
she
was
still
asleep
her
lips
were
parted
and
she
was
breathing
not
softly
usual
with
her
but
long
heavy
gasps
though
striving
get
her
lungs
full
every
breath
came
close
she
put
her
hand
her
sleep
and
pulled
the
collar
her
nightdress
close
around
her
throat
whilst
she
did
there
came
little
shudder
through
her
though
she
felt
the
cold
flung
the
warm
shawl
over
her
and
drew
the
edges
tight
round
her
neck
for
dreaded
lest
she
should
get
some
deadly
chill
from
the
night
air
unclad
she
was
feared
wake
her
all
once
order
have
hands
free
that
might
help
her
fastened
the
shawl
her
throat
with
big
safety
pin
but
must
have
been
clumsy
anxiety
and
pinched
pricked
her
with
for
and
when
her
breathing
became
quieter
she
put
her
hand
her
throat
again
and
moaned
when
had
her
carefully
wrapped
put
shoes
her
feet
and
then
began
very
gently
wake
her
first
she
did
not
respond
but
gradually
she
became
more
and
more
uneasy
her
sleep
moaning
and
sighing
occasionally
last
time
was
passing
fast
and
for
many
other
reasons
wished
get
her
home
once
shook
her
more
forcibly
till
finally
she
opened
her
eyes
and
awoke
she
did
not
seem
surprised
see
course
she
did
not
realise
all
once
where
she
was
lucy
always
wakes
prettily
and
even
such
time
when
her
body
must
have
been
chilled
with
cold
and
her
mind
somewhat
appalled
waking
unclad
churchyard
night
she
did
not
lose
her
grace
she
trembled
little
and
clung
when
told
her
come
once
with
home
she
rose
without
word
with
the
obedience
child
passed
along
the
gravel
hurt
feet
and
lucy
noticed
wince
she
stopped
and
wanted
insist
upon
taking
shoes
but
would
not
however
when
got
the
pathway
outside
the
churchyard
where
there
was
puddle
water
remaining
from
the
storm
daubed
feet
with
mud
using
each
foot
turn
the
other
that
went
home
one
case
should
meet
any
one
should
notice
bare
feet
fortune
favoured
and
got
home
without
meeting
soul
once
saw
man
who
seemed
not
quite
sober
passing
along
street
front
but
hid
door
till
had
disappeared
opening
such
there
are
here
steep
little
closes
wynds
they
call
them
scotland
heart
beat
loud
all
the
time
that
sometimes
thought
should
faint
was
filled
with
anxiety
about
lucy
not
only
for
her
health
lest
she
should
suffer
from
the
exposure
but
for
her
reputation
case
the
story
should
get
wind
when
got
and
had
washed
our
feet
and
had
said
prayer
thankfulness
together
tucked
her
into
bed
before
falling
asleep
she
asked
even
implored
not
say
word
any
one
even
her
mother
about
her
sleep
walking
adventure
hesitated
first
promise
but
thinking
the
state
her
mother
health
and
how
the
knowledge
such
thing
would
fret
her
and
thinking
too
how
such
story
might
become
distorted
nay
infallibly
would
case
should
leak
out
thought
wiser
hope
did
right
have
locked
the
door
and
the
key
tied
wrist
perhaps
shall
not
again
disturbed
lucy
sleeping
soundly
the
reflex
the
dawn
high
and
far
over
the
sea
same
day
noon
all
goes
well
lucy
slept
till
woke
her
and
seemed
not
have
even
changed
her
side
the
adventure
the
night
does
not
seem
have
harmed
her
the
contrary
has
benefited
her
for
she
looks
better
this
morning
than
she
has
done
for
weeks
was
sorry
notice
that
clumsiness
with
the
safety
pin
hurt
her
indeed
might
have
been
serious
for
the
skin
her
throat
was
pierced
must
have
pinched
piece
loose
skin
and
have
transfixed
for
there
are
two
little
red
points
like
pin
pricks
and
the
band
her
nightdress
was
drop
blood
when
apologised
and
was
concerned
about
she
laughed
and
petted
and
said
she
did
not
even
feel
fortunately
cannot
leave
scar
tiny
same
day
night
passed
happy
day
the
air
was
clear
and
the
sun
bright
and
there
was
cool
breeze
took
our
lunch
mulgrave
woods
mrs
westenra
driving
the
road
and
lucy
and
walking
the
cliff
path
and
joining
her
the
gate
felt
little
sad
myself
for
could
not
but
feel
how
absolutely
happy
would
have
been
had
jonathan
been
with
but
there
must
only
patient
the
evening
strolled
the
casino
terrace
and
heard
some
good
music
spohr
and
mackenzie
and
went
bed
early
lucy
seems
more
restful
than
she
has
been
for
some
time
and
fell
asleep
once
shall
lock
the
door
and
secure
the
key
the
same
before
though
not
expect
any
trouble
night
august
expectations
were
wrong
for
twice
during
the
night
was
wakened
lucy
trying
get
out
she
seemed
even
her
sleep
little
impatient
finding
the
door
shut
and
went
back
bed
under
sort
protest
woke
with
the
dawn
and
heard
the
birds
chirping
outside
the
window
lucy
woke
too
and
was
glad
see
was
even
better
than
the
previous
morning
all
her
old
gaiety
manner
seemed
have
come
back
and
she
came
and
snuggled
beside
and
told
all
about
arthur
told
her
how
anxious
was
about
jonathan
and
then
she
tried
comfort
well
she
succeeded
somewhat
for
though
sympathy
can
alter
facts
can
help
make
them
more
bearable
august
another
quiet
day
and
bed
with
the
key
wrist
before
again
awoke
the
night
and
found
lucy
sitting
bed
still
asleep
pointing
the
window
got
quietly
and
pulling
aside
the
blind
looked
out
was
brilliant
moonlight
and
the
soft
effect
the
light
over
the
sea
and
sky
merged
together
one
great
silent
mystery
was
beautiful
beyond
words
between
and
the
moonlight
flitted
great
bat
coming
and
going
great
whirling
circles
once
twice
came
quite
close
but
was
suppose
frightened
seeing
and
flitted
away
across
the
harbour
towards
the
abbey
when
came
back
from
the
window
lucy
had
lain
down
again
and
was
sleeping
peacefully
she
did
not
stir
again
all
night
august
the
east
cliff
reading
and
writing
all
day
lucy
seems
have
become
much
love
with
the
spot
and
hard
get
her
away
from
when
time
come
home
for
lunch
tea
dinner
this
afternoon
she
made
funny
remark
were
coming
home
for
dinner
and
had
come
the
top
the
steps
from
the
west
pier
and
stopped
look
the
view
generally
the
setting
sun
low
down
the
sky
was
just
dropping
behind
kettleness
the
red
light
was
thrown
over
the
east
cliff
and
the
old
abbey
and
seemed
bathe
everything
beautiful
rosy
glow
were
silent
for
while
and
suddenly
lucy
murmured
herself
his
red
eyes
again
they
are
just
the
same
was
such
odd
expression
coming
apropos
nothing
that
quite
startled
slewed
round
little
see
lucy
well
without
seeming
stare
her
and
saw
that
she
was
half
dreamy
state
with
odd
look
her
face
that
could
not
quite
make
out
said
nothing
but
followed
her
eyes
she
appeared
looking
over
our
own
seat
whereon
was
dark
figure
seated
alone
was
little
startled
myself
for
seemed
for
instant
the
stranger
had
great
eyes
like
burning
flames
but
second
look
dispelled
the
illusion
the
red
sunlight
was
shining
the
windows
mary
church
behind
our
seat
and
the
sun
dipped
there
was
just
sufficient
change
the
refraction
and
reflection
make
appear
the
light
moved
called
lucy
attention
the
peculiar
effect
and
she
became
herself
with
start
but
she
looked
sad
all
the
same
may
have
been
that
she
was
thinking
that
terrible
night
there
never
refer
said
nothing
and
went
home
dinner
lucy
had
headache
and
went
early
bed
saw
her
asleep
and
went
out
for
little
stroll
myself
walked
along
the
cliffs
the
westward
and
was
full
sweet
sadness
for
was
thinking
jonathan
when
coming
home
was
then
bright
moonlight
bright
that
though
the
front
our
part
the
crescent
was
shadow
everything
could
well
seen
threw
glance
our
window
and
saw
lucy
head
leaning
out
thought
that
perhaps
she
was
looking
out
for
opened
handkerchief
and
waved
she
did
not
notice
make
any
movement
whatever
just
then
the
moonlight
crept
round
angle
the
building
and
the
light
fell
the
window
there
distinctly
was
lucy
with
her
head
lying
against
the
side
the
window
sill
and
her
eyes
shut
she
was
fast
asleep
and
her
seated
the
window
sill
was
something
that
looked
like
good
sized
bird
was
afraid
she
might
get
chill
ran
upstairs
but
came
into
the
room
she
was
moving
back
her
bed
fast
asleep
and
breathing
heavily
she
was
holding
her
hand
her
throat
though
protect
from
cold
did
not
wake
her
but
tucked
her
warmly
have
taken
care
that
the
door
locked
and
the
window
securely
fastened
she
looks
sweet
she
sleeps
but
she
paler
than
her
wont
and
there
drawn
haggard
look
under
her
eyes
which
not
like
fear
she
fretting
about
something
wish
could
find
out
what
august
rose
later
than
usual
lucy
was
languid
and
tired
and
slept
after
had
been
called
had
happy
surprise

and
sorry

later

day

grieved

very
own
but
she
rejoiced
that

some
one

her
poor
dear
sweet
lady
she
confided
that
she
has
got
her
death
warrant

has
not
told
lucy
and
made
promise
secrecy
her
doctor
told
her
that
within
few
months
most
she
must
die
for
her
heart
weakening
any
time
even
now
sudden
shock
would
almost

were
wise

dreadful

two
whole

the
heart

sort
shadowy
pall
seems
coming
over

growing
weaker
whilst
her
mother
hours
are
numbering
close
not

lucy
fading

well
and
sleeps
well
and
enjoys
the
fresh

more
languid

cried
silently
between
long
painful
struggles
for
breath
when
asked
her
how

shook
her
head
and
turned

happy
day
and

sitting
the
seat
the
churchyard
lucy
ever
much
better
last
night
she
slept
well
all
night
and
did
not
disturb
once
the
roses
seem
coming
back
already
her
cheeks
though
she
still
sadly
pale
and
wan
looking
she
were
any
way
anæmic
could
understand
but
she
not
she
gay
spirits
and
full
life
and
cheerfulness
all
the
morbid
reticence
seems
have
passed
from
her
and
she
has
just
reminded
needed
any
reminding
that
night
and
that
was
here
this
very
seat
found
her
asleep
she
told
she
tapped
playfully
with
the
heel
her
boot
the
stone
slab
and
said
poor
little
feet
didn
make
much
noise
then
daresay
poor
old
swales
would
have
told
that
was
because
didn
want
wake
geordie
she
was
such
communicative
humour
asked
her
she
had
dreamed
all
that
night
before
she
answered
that
sweet
puckered
look
came
into
her
forehead
which
arthur
call
him
arthur
from
her
habit
says
loves
and
indeed
don
wonder
that
does
then
she
went
half
dreaming
kind
way
trying
recall
herself
didn
quite
dream
but
all
seemed
real
only
wanted
here
this
spot
don
know
why
for
was
afraid
something
don
know
what
remember
though
suppose
was
asleep
passing
through
the
streets
and
over
the
bridge
fish
leaped
went
and
leaned
over
look
and
heard
lot
dogs
howling
the
whole
town
seemed
must
full
dogs
all
howling
once
went
the
steps
then
had
vague
memory
something
long
and
dark
with
red
eyes
just
saw
the
sunset
and
something
very
sweet
and
very
bitter
all
around
once
and
then
seemed
sinking
into
deep
green
water
and
there
was
singing
ears
have
heard
there
drowning
men
and
then
everything
seemed
passing
away
from
soul
seemed
out
from
body
and
float
about
the
air
seem
remember
that
once
the
west
lighthouse
was
right
under
and
then
there
was
sort
agonising
feeling
were
earthquake
and
came
back
and
found
you
shaking
body
saw
you
before
felt
you
then
she
began
laugh
seemed
little
uncanny
and
listened
her
breathlessly
did
not
quite
like
and
thought
better
not
keep
her
mind
the
subject
drifted
other
subjects
and
lucy
was
like
her
old
self
again
when
got
home
the
fresh
breeze
had
braced
her
and
her
pale
cheeks
were
really
more
rosy
her
mother
rejoiced
when
she
saw
her
and
all
spent
very
happy
evening
together

seward

august
strange
and
sudden
change
renfield
last
night
about
eight
clock
began
get
excited
and
sniff
about
dog
does
when
setting
the
attendant
was
struck
his
manner
and
knowing
interest
him
encouraged
him
talk
usually
respectful
the
attendant
and
times
servile
but
night
the
man
tells
was
quite
haughty
would
not
condescend
talk
with
him
all
all
would
say
was
don
want
talk
you
you
don
count
now
the
master
hand
the
attendant
thinks
some
sudden
form
religious
mania
which
has
seized
him
must
look
out
for
squalls
for
strong
man
with
homicidal
and
religious
mania
once
might
dangerous
the
combination
dreadful
one
nine
clock
visited
him
myself
his
attitude
was
the
same
that
the
attendant
his
sublime
self
feeling
the
difference
between
myself
and
attendant
seemed
him
nothing
looks
like
religious
mania
and
will
soon
think
that
himself
god
these
infinitesimal
distinctions
between
man
and
man
are
too
paltry
for
omnipotent
being
how
these
madmen
give
themselves
away
the
real
god
taketh
heed
lest
sparrow
fall
but
the
god
created
from
human
vanity
sees
difference
between
eagle
and
sparrow
men
only
knew
for
half
hour
more
renfield
kept
getting
excited
greater
and
greater
degree
did
not
pretend
watching
him
but
kept
strict
observation
all
the
same
all
once
that
shifty
look
came
into
his
eyes
which
always
see
when
madman
has
seized
idea
and
with
the
shifty
movement
the
head
and
back
which
asylum
attendants
come
know
well
became
quite
quiet
and
went
and
sat
the
edge
his
bed
resignedly
and
looked
into
space
with
lack
lustre
eyes
thought
would
find
out
his
apathy
were
real
only
assumed
and
tried
lead
him
talk
his
pets
theme
which
had
never
failed
excite
his
attention
first
made
reply
but
length
said
testily
bother
them
all
don
care
pin
about
them
what
said
you
don
mean
tell
you
don
care
about
spiders
spiders
present
are
his
hobby
and
the
note
book
filling
with
columns
small
figures
this
answered
enigmatically
the
bride
maidens
rejoice
the
eyes
that
wait
the
coming
the
bride
but
when
the
bride
draweth
nigh
then
the
maidens
shine
not
the
eyes
that
are
filled
would
not
explain
himself
but
remained
obstinately
seated
his
bed
all
the
time
remained
with
him
weary
night
and
low
spirits
cannot
but
think
lucy
and
how
different
things
might
have
been

that
renfield

ran
down

about
those
ideas

work
out
dangerously
with
strangers
the
attendant
was
waiting
for

not
ten
minutes
before
seemingly
asleep

his
attention
was
called
the
sound

back
and
saw
his
feet
disappear
through
the
window
and
had
once
sent
for

only
his
night
gear
and
cannot

unhurt
the

just
disappearing
behind

side
the
house
found
him
pressed
close
against
the
old
ironbound
oak
door
the
chapel
was
talking
apparently
some
one
but
was
afraid
near
enough
hear
what
was
saying
lest
might
frighten
him
and
should
run
off
chasing
errant
swarm
bees
nothing
following
naked
lunatic
when
the
fit
escaping
upon
him
after
few
minutes
however
could
see
that
did
not
take
note
anything
around
him
and
ventured
draw
nearer
him
the
more
men
had
now
crossed
the
wall
and
were
closing
him
heard
him
say
here

the
case
renfield
grows
even
more
interesting
has
now
far
quieted
that
there
are
spells
cessation
from
his
passion
for
the
first
week
after
his
attack
was
perpetually
violent
then
one
night
just
the
moon
rose
grew
quiet
and
kept
murmuring
himself
now
can
wait
now
can
wait
the
attendant
came
tell
ran
down
once
have
look
him
was
still
the
strait
waistcoat
and
the
padded
room
but
the
suffused
look
had
gone
from
his
face
and
his
eyes
had
something
their
old
pleading
might
almost
say
cringing
softness
was
satisfied
with
his
present
condition
and
directed
him
relieved
the
attendants
hesitated
but
finally
carried
out
wishes
without
protest
was
strange
thing
that
the
patient
had
humour
enough
see
their
distrust
for
coming
close
said
whisper
all
the
while
looking
furtively
them
they
think
could
hurt
you
fancy
hurting
you
the
fools
was
soothing
somehow
the
feelings
find
myself
dissociated
even
the
mind
this
poor
madman
from
the
others
but
all
the
same
not
follow
his
thought
take
that
have
anything
common
with
him
that
are
were
stand
together
has
gain
from
some
good
stupendous
that
well
being
needful
him
must
find
out
later
night
will
not
speak
even
the
offer
kitten
even
full
grown
cat
will
not
tempt
him
will
only
say
don
take
any
stock
cats
have
more
think
now
and
can
wait
can
wait
after
while
left
him
the
attendant
tells
that
was
quiet
until
just
before
dawn
and
that
then
began
get
uneasy
and
length
violent
until
last
fell
into
paroxysm
which
exhausted
him
that
swooned
into
sort
coma
three
nights
has
the
same
thing
happened
violent
all
day
then
quiet
from
moonrise
sunrise
wish
could
get
some
clue
the
cause
would
almost
seem
there
was
some
influence
which
came
and
went
happy
thought
shall
night
play
sane
wits
against
mad
ones
escaped
before

found
miss

her

was

and
few
seconds
made
mind
that
she
was
trying
all
she
knew

her

and
prevent
her
from
being
anxious
have

she

there
lunched
alone
and
all
exerted
ourselves
cheerful
got
some
kind
reward
for
our
labours
some
real
cheerfulness
amongst
then
mrs
westenra
went
lie
down
and
lucy
was
left
with
went
into
her
boudoir
and
till
got
there
her
gaiety
remained
for
the
servants
were
coming
and
going
soon
the
door
was
closed
however
the
mask
fell
from
her
face
and
she
sank
down
into
chair
with
great
sigh
and
hid
her
eyes
with
her
hand
when
saw
that
her
high
spirits
had
failed
once
took
advantage
her
reaction
make
diagnosis
she
said
very
sweetly
cannot
tell
you
how
loathe
talking
about
myself
reminded
her
that
doctor
confidence
was
sacred
but
that
you
were
grievously
anxious
about
her
she
caught
meaning
once
and
settled
that
matter
word
tell
arthur
everything
you
choose
not
care
for
myself
but
all
for
him
quite
free
could
easily
see
that
she
somewhat
bloodless
but
could
not
see
the
usual
anæmic
signs
and
chance
was
actually
able
test
the
quality
her
blood
for
opening
window
which
was
stiff
cord
gave
way
and
she
cut
her
hand
slightly
with
broken
glass
was
slight
matter
itself
but
gave
evident
chance
and
secured
few
drops
the
blood
and
have
analysed
them
the
qualitative
analysis
gives
quite
normal
condition
and
shows
should
infer
itself
vigorous
state
health
other
physical
matters
was
quite
satisfied
that
there
need
for
anxiety
but
there
must
cause
somewhere
have
come
the
conclusion
that
must
something
mental
she
complains
difficulty
breathing
satisfactorily
times
and
heavy
lethargic
sleep
with
dreams
that
frighten
her
but
regarding
which
she
can
remember
nothing
she
says
that
child
she
used
walk
her
sleep
and
that
when
whitby

habit
came

with
hillingham
and
found
that
lucy
discretion
her
mother
was
lunching
out
that
were
alone
with
her
van
helsing
made
very
careful
examination
the
patient
report
and
shall
advise
you
for
course
was
not
present
all
the
time
fear
much
concerned
but
says
must
think
when
told
him
our
friendship
and
how
you
trust
the
matter
said
you
must
tell
him
all
you
think
tell
him
what
think
you
can
guess
you
will
nay
not
jesting
this
jest
but
life
and
death
perhaps
more
asked
what
meant
that
for
was
very
serious
this
was
when
had
come
back
town
and
was
having
cup
tea
before
starting
his
return
amsterdam
would
not
give
any
further
clue
you
must
not
angry
with
art
because
his
very
reticence
means
that
all
his
brains
are
working
for
her
good
will
speak
plainly
enough
when
the
time
comes
sure
told
him
would
simply
write
account
our
visit
just
were
doing
descriptive
special
article
for
the
daily
telegraph
seemed
not
notice
but
remarked
that
the
smuts
london
were
not
quite
bad
they
used
when
was
student
here
get
his
report
morrow
can
possibly
make
any
case
have
letter
well
the
visit
lucy
was
more
cheerful
than
the
day
first
saw
her
and
certainly
looked
better
she
had
lost
something
the
ghastly
look
that
upset
you
and
her
breathing
was
normal
she
was
very
sweet
the
professor
she
always
and
tried
make
him
feel
ease
though
could
see
that
the
poor
girl
was
making
hard
struggle
for
believe
van
helsing
saw
too
for
saw
the
quick
look
under
his
bushy
brows
that
knew
old
then
began
chat
all
things
except
ourselves
and
diseases
and
with
such
infinite
geniality
that
could
see
poor
lucy
pretense
animation
merge
into
reality
then
without
any
seeming
change
brought
the
conversation
gently
round
his
visit
and
suavely
said
dear
young
miss
have
the
great
pleasure
because
you
are
much
beloved
that
much
dear
ever
were
there
that
which
not
see
they
told
you
were
down
the
spirit
and
that
you
were
ghastly
pale
them
say
pouf
and
snapped
his
fingers
and
went
but
you
and
shall
show
them
how
wrong
they
are
how
can
and
pointed
with
the
same
look
and
gesture
that
with
which
once
pointed
out
his
class
rather
after
particular
occasion
which
never
fails
remind
know
anything
young
ladies
has
his
madams
play
with
and
bring
them
back
happiness
and
those
that
love
them
much
and
but
there
are
rewards
that
can
bestow
such
happiness
but
the
young
ladies
has
wife
nor
daughter
and
the
young
not
tell
themselves
the
young
but
the
old
like
who
have
known
many
sorrows
and
the
causes
them
dear
will
send
him
away
smoke
the
cigarette
the
garden
whiles
you
and
have
little
talk
all
ourselves
took
the
hint
and
strolled
about
and
presently
the
professor
came
the
window
and
called
looked
grave
but
said
have
made
careful
examination
but
there
functional
cause
with
you
agree
that
there
has
been
much
blood
lost

been
but

but
the
conditions

are
way
anæmic
have
asked
her

her
maid
that
may
ask
just
one
two
question
that
may
not
chance
miss
nothing

well
what
she
will
say
and
yet
there
cause
there
always

for
everything

back
home
and
think
you
must
send
the
telegram
every
day

from

september
zoöphagous
patient
still
keeps
our
interest
him
had
only
one
outburst
and
that
was
yesterday
unusual
time
just
before
the
stroke
noon
began
grow
restless
the
attendant
knew
the
symptoms
and
once
summoned
aid
fortunately
the
men
came
run
and
were
just
time
for
the
stroke
noon
became
violent
that
took
all
their
strength
hold
him
about
five
minutes
however
began
get
more
and
more
quiet
and
finally
sank
into
sort
melancholy
which
state
has
remained
now
the
attendant
tells
that
his
screams
whilst
the
paroxysm
were
really
appalling
found
hands
full
when
got
attending
some
the
other
patients
who
were
frightened
him
indeed
can
quite
understand
the
effect
for
the
sounds
disturbed
even
though
was
some
distance
away
now
after
the
dinner
hour
the
asylum
and
yet
patient
sits
corner
brooding
with
dull
sullen
woe
begone
look
his
face
which
seems
rather
indicate
than
show
something
directly
cannot
quite
understand
later
another
change
patient
five
clock
looked
him
and
found
him
seemingly
happy
and
contented
used
was
catching
flies
and
eating
them
and
was
keeping
note
his
capture
making
nail
marks
the
edge
the
door
between
the
ridges
padding
when
saw
came
over
and
apologised
for
his
bad
conduct
and
asked
very
humble
cringing
way
led
back
his
own
room
and
have
his
note
book
again
thought
well
humour
him
back
his
room
with
the
window
open
has
the
sugar
his
tea
spread
out
the
window
sill
and
reaping
quite
harvest
flies
not
now
eating
them
but
putting
them
into
box
old
and
already
examining
the
corners
his
room
find
spider
tried
get
him
talk
about
the
past
few
days
for
any
clue
his
thoughts
would
immense
help
but
would
not
rise
for
moment
two
looked
very
sad
and
said
sort
far
away
voice
though
saying
rather
himself
than
all
over
all
over
has
deserted
hope
for
now
unless
for
myself
then
suddenly
turning
resolute
way
said
doctor
won
you
very
good
and
let
have
little
more
sugar
think
would
good
for
and
the
flies
said
yes
the
flies
like
too
and
like
the
flies
therefore
like
and
there
are
people
who
know
little
think
that
madmen
not
argue
procured
him
double
supply
and
left
him
happy
man
suppose
any
the
world
wish
could
fathom
his
mind
midnight
another
change
him
had
been
see
miss
westenra
whom
found
much
better
and
had
just
returned
and
was
standing
our
own
gate
looking
the
sunset
when
once
more
heard
him
yelling
his
room
this
side
the
house
could
hear
better
than
the
morning
was
shock
turn
from
the
wonderful
smoky
beauty
sunset
over
london
with
its
lurid
lights
and
inky
shadows
and
all
the
marvellous
tints
that
come
foul
clouds
even
foul
water
and
realise
all
the
grim
sternness
own
cold
stone
building
with
its
wealth
breathing
misery
and
own
desolate
heart
endure
all
reached
him
just
the
sun
was
going
down
and
from
his
window
saw
the
red
disc
sink
sank
became
less
and
less
frenzied
and
just
dipped
slid
from
the
hands
that
held
him
inert
mass
the
floor
wonderful
however

but

and
good
friend
john
let
caution
you
you
deal
with
the
madmen
all
men
are
mad
some
way
the
other
and
inasmuch
you
deal
discreetly
with
your
madmen
deal
with
god
madmen
too
the
rest
the
world
you
tell
not
your
madmen
what
you
nor
why
you
you
tell
them
not
what
you
think
you
shall
keep
knowledge
its
place
where
may
rest
where
may
gather
its
kind
around
and
breed
you
and
shall
keep
yet
what
know
here
and
here
touched
the
heart
and
the
forehead
and
then
touched
himself
the
same
way
have
for
myself
thoughts
the
present
later
shall
unfold
you
why
not
now
asked
may
some
good
may
arrive
some
decision
stopped
and
looked
and
said
friend
john
when
the
corn
grown
even
before
has
ripened
while
the
milk
its
mother
earth
him
and
the
sunshine
has
not
yet
begun
paint
him
with
his
gold
the
husbandman
pull
the
ear
and
rub
him
between
his
rough
hands
and
blow
away
the
green
chaff
and
say
you
look
good
corn
will
make
good
crop
when
the
time
comes
did
not
see
the
application
and
told
him
for
reply
reached
over
and
took
ear
his
hand
and
pulled
playfully
used
long
ago
lectures
and
said
the
good
husbandman
tell
you
then
because
knows
but
not
till
then
but
you
not
find
the
good
husbandman
dig
his
planted
corn
see
grow
that
for
the
children
who
play
husbandry
and
not
for
those
who
take
the
work
their
life
see
you
now
friend
john
have
sown
corn
and
nature
has
her
work
making
sprout
sprout
all
there
some
promise
and
wait
till
the
ear
begins
swell
broke
off
for
evidently
saw
that
understood
then
went
and
very
gravely
you
were
always
careful
student
and
your
case
book
was
ever
more
full
than
the
rest
you
were
only
student
then
now
you
are
master
and
trust
that
good
habit
have
not
fail
remember
friend
that
knowledge
stronger
than
memory
and
should
not
trust
the
weaker
even
you
have
not
kept
the
good
practise
let
tell
you
that
this
case
our
dear
miss
one
that
may
mind
say
may
such
interest
and
others
that
all
the
rest
may
not
make
him
kick
the
beam
your
peoples
say
take
then
good
note
nothing
too
small
counsel
you
put
down
record
even
your
doubts
and
surmises
hereafter
may
interest
you
see
how
true
you
guess
learn
from
failure
not
from
success
when
described
lucy
symptoms
the
same
before
but
infinitely
more
marked
looked
very
grave
but
said
nothing
took
with
him
bag
which
were
many
instruments
and
drugs
the
ghastly
paraphernalia
our
beneficial
trade
once
called
one
his
lectures
the
equipment
professor
the
healing
craft
when
were
shown
mrs
westenra
met
she
was
alarmed
but
not
nearly
much
expected
find
her
nature
one
her
beneficent
moods
has
ordained
that
even
death
has
some
antidote
its
own
terrors
here
case
where
any
shock
may
prove
fatal
matters
are
ordered
that
from
some
cause
other
the
things
not
personal
even
the
terrible
change
her
daughter
whom
she
attached
not
seem
reach
her
something
like
the
way
dame
nature
gathers
round
foreign
body
envelope
some
insensitive
tissue
which
can
protect
from
evil
that
which
would
otherwise
harm
contact
this
ordered
selfishness
then
should
pause
before
condemn
any
one
for
the
vice
egoism
for
there
may
deeper
root
for
its
causes
than
have
knowledge
used

this
phase
spiritual
pathology
and
laid
down
rule
that
she
should
not
present

almost
touched
over

nose
lucy
lay
motionless
and
did
not
seem

for
while

all
silent
then
van

went
gently
out

room
the
instant

its
origin
his
answer

arthur
turned

and
said

not

but
she
was
simply
too
weak
make
the
effort
her
eyes
spoke
that
was
all
van
helsing
took
some
things
from
his
bag
and
laid
them
little
table
out
sight
then
mixed
narcotic
and
coming
over
the

effort
with
success
astonished
how
long
the
drug
took
act
this
fact
marked
the
extent
her
weakness
the
time
seemed
endless
until
sleep
began
flicker
her
eyelids
last
however
the
narcotic
began
manifest
its
potency
and
she
fell
into
deep
sleep
when
the
professor
was
satisfied
called
arthur
into
the
room
and
bade
him
strip
off
his
coat
then
added

one
little
kiss

neither
looked
whilst
bent
over
her
van
helsing
turning
said
young
and
strong
and
blood
pure
that
need
not
defibrinate
then
with
swiftness
but
with
absolute
method
van
helsing
performed
the
operation
the
transfusion
went
something
like
life
seemed
come
back
poor
lucy
cheeks
and
through
arthur
growing
pallor
the
joy
his
face
seemed
absolutely
shine
after
bit
began
grow
anxious
for
the
loss

was
telling
arthur
strong
man
was
gave
idea
what
terrible
strain
lucy
system
must
have
undergone
that
what
weakened
arthur
only
partially
restored
her
but
the
professor
face
was
set
and
stood
watch
hand
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
now
the
patient
and
now
arthur
could
hear
own
heart
beat
presently
said
soft
voice
not
stir
instant
enough
you
attend
him
will
look
her
when
all
was
over
could
see
how
much
arthur
was
weakened
dressed
the
wound
and
took
his
arm
bring
him
away
when
van
helsing
spoke
without
turning
round
the
man
seems
have
eyes
the
back
his
head
the
brave
lover
think
deserve
another
kiss
which
shall
have
presently
and
had
now
finished
his
operation
adjusted
the
pillow
the
patient
head
did
the
narrow
black
velvet
band
which
she
seems
always
wear
round
her
throat
buckled
with
old
diamond
buckle
which
her
lover
had
given
her
was
dragged
little
and
showed
red
mark
her
throat
arthur
did
not
notice
but
could
hear
the
deep
hiss
indrawn
breath
which
one
van
helsing
ways
betraying
emotion
said
nothing
the
moment
but
turned
saying
now
take
down
our
brave
young
lover
give
him
the
port
wine
and
let
him
lie
down
while
must
then
home
and
rest
sleep
much
and
eat
much

bye
when
arthur
had
gone
went
back
the
room
lucy
was
sleeping
gently
but
her
breathing
was
stronger
could
see
the
counterpane
move
her
breast
heaved
the
bedside
sat
van
helsing
looking
her
intently
the
velvet
band
again
covered
the
red
mark
asked
the
professor
whisper
what
you
make
that
mark
her
throat
what
you
make
have
not
examined
yet
answered
and
then
and
there
proceeded
loose
the
band
just
over
the
external
jugular
vein
there
were
two
punctures
not
large
but
not
wholesome
looking
there
was
sign
disease
but
the
edges
were
white
and
worn
looking
some
trituration
once
occurred
that
this
wound
whatever
was
might
the
means
that
manifest
loss
blood
but
abandoned
the
idea
soon
formed
for
such
thing

whole
bed
would
have
been
drenched
scarlet
with
the
blood
which
the
girl
must
have

seward
diary
continued
september
sat
all
night
with
lucy
the
opiate
worked
itself
off
towards
dusk
and
she
waked
naturally
she
looked
different
being
from
what
she
had
been
before
the
operation
her
spirits
even
were
good
and
she
was
full
happy
vivacity
but
could
see
evidences
the
absolute
prostration
which
she
had
undergone
when
told
mrs
westenra
that
van
helsing
had
directed
that
should
sit
with
her
she
almost
pooh
poohed
the
idea
pointing
out
her
daughter
renewed
strength
and
excellent
spirits
was
firm
however
and
made
preparations
for
long
vigil
when
her
maid
had
prepared
her
for
the
night
came
having
the
meantime
had
supper
and
took
seat
the
bedside
she
did
not
any
way
make
objection
but
looked
gratefully
whenever
caught
her
eye
after
long
spell
she
seemed
sinking
off
sleep
but
with
effort
seemed
pull
herself
together
and
shook
off
this
was
repeated
several
times
with
greater
effort
and
with
shorter
pauses
the
time
moved
was
apparent
that
she
did
not
want
sleep
tackled
the
subject
once
you
not
want
sleep
afraid
afraid
sleep
why
the
boon
all
crave
for
not
you
were
like
sleep
was
you
presage
horror
presage
horror
what
earth
you
mean
don
know
don
know
and
that
what
terrible
all
this
weakness
comes
sleep
until
dread
the
very
thought
but
dear
girl
you
may
sleep
night
here
watching
you
and
can
promise
that
nothing
will
happen
can
trust
you
seized
the
opportunity
and
said
promise
you
that
see
any
evidence
bad
dreams
will
wake
you
once
you
will
will
you
really
how
good
you
are
then
will
sleep
and
almost
the
word
she
gave
deep
sigh
relief
and
sank
back
asleep
all
night
long
watched
her
she
never
stirred
but
slept
and
deep
tranquil
life
giving
health
giving
sleep
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
and
her
breast
rose
and
fell
with
the
regularity
pendulum
there
was
smile
her
face
and
was
evident
that
bad
dreams
had
come
disturb
her
peace
mind
the
early
morning
her
maid
came
and

swoon
lay
poor

more
horribly
white
and
wan

now
next
duty
was
keep
strength
felt
very
weak
and
the
weakness
lost
something
the
amazement
what
had
occurred
fell
asleep
the
sofa
however
wondering
over
and
over
again
how
lucy
had
made
such
retrograde
movement
and
how
she
could
have
been
drained
much
blood
with
sign
anywhere

have
continued
wonder

for
sleeping
and

came
back
the
little
punctures
her
throat
and
the
ragged
exhausted
appearance
their
edges
tiny
though
they
were
lucy
slept
well
into
the
day
and
when
she
woke
she
was
fairly
well
and
strong
though
not
nearly
much
the
day
before
when
van
helsing
had
seen
her
went
out
for
walk
leaving
charge
with
strict
injunctions
that
was
not

her
for
moment
could
hear
his
voice
the
hall
asking
the
way
the
nearest
telegraph
office
lucy
chatted
with
freely
and
seemed
quite
unconscious
that
anything
had
happened
tried
keep
her
amused
and
interested
when
her
mother
came
see
her
she
did
not
seem
notice
any
change
whatever
but
said
gratefully
owe
you
much
seward
for
all
you
have
done
but
you
really
must
now
take
care
not
overwork
yourself
you
are
looking
pale
yourself
you
want
wife
nurse
and
look
after
you
bit
that

she
spoke
lucy
turned
crimson
though
was
only
momentarily
for
her
poor
wasted
veins
could
not
stand
for
long
such
unwonted
drain
the
head
the
reaction
came
excessive
pallor
she
turned
imploring
eyes
smiled
and
nodded
and
laid
finger
lips
with
sigh
she
sank
back
amid
her
pillows
van
helsing
returned
couple
hours
and
presently
said
now

and
asked

implored

van

that

they
asked
quite
piteously

with
the
foreign
gentleman

much
touched
their
kindness

because
weak

and
perhaps
because
was

the
floridas
and
find
him
all
too
late
whilst
was
speaking
lucy
had
been
examining
the
flowers
and
smelling
them
now
she
threw
them
down
saying
with
half
laughter
and
half
disgust
professor
believe
you
are
only
putting
joke
why
these
flowers
are
only
common
garlic
surprise
van
helsing
rose
and
said
with
all
his
sternness
his
iron
jaw
set
and
his
bushy
eyebrows
meeting
trifling
with
never
jest
there
grim
purpose
all
and
warn
you
that
you
not
thwart
take
care
for
the
sake

not
for
your
own
then
seeing
poor
lucy
scared
she
might
well

securely
next
taking
handful

all
over

though
ensure
that
every
whiff

then
with
the
wisp
rubbed
all
over
the
jamb
the
door
above
below
and
each
side
and
round
the
fireplace
the

stern
sadness
and
infinite
pity

murmured
with
that
hissing
inspiration
his
which
meant
much

the

whilst
van

recruited
himself
and
rested
presently
took
opportunity
telling
mrs
westenra
that
she
must
not
remove
anything
from

room
without
consulting
him
that
the
flowers
were
medicinal

and
that
the
breathing

saying
that

the
next
and
would
send

with
that
lifts
his
perlite
lord
and
walks
away
old
bersicker
kep
lookin
arter
till
was
out
sight
and
then
went
and
lay
down
corner
and
wouldn
come
hout
the
ole
hevening
well
larst
night
soon
the
moon
was
hup
the
wolves
here
all
began
owling
there
warn
nothing
for
them
owl
there
warn
one
near
except
some
one
that
was
evidently
callin
dog
somewheres
out
back
the
gardings
the
park
road
once
twice
went
out
see
that
all
was
right
and
was
and
then
the
owling
stopped
just
before
twelve
clock
just
took
look
round
afore
turnin
bust
but
when
kem
opposite
old
bersicker
cage
see
the
rails
broken
and
twisted
about
and
the
cage
empty
and
that
all
know
for
certing
did
any
one
else
see
anything
one
our
gard
ners
was
comin
ome
about
that
time
from
armony
when
sees
big
grey
dog
comin
out
through
the
garding
edges
least
says
but
don
give
much
for
myself
for
did
never
said
word
about
his
missis
when
got
ome
and
was
only
after
the
escape
the
wolf
was
made
known
and
had
been
all
night
huntin
the
park
for
bersicker
that
remembered
seein
anything
own
belief
was
that
the
armony
got
into
his
ead
now
bilder
can
you
account
any
way
for
the
escape
the
wolf
well
sir
said
with
suspicious
sort
modesty
think
can
but
don
know
you
satisfied
with
the
theory
certainly
shall
man
like
you
who
knows
the
animals
from
experience
can
hazard
good
guess
any
rate
who
even
try
well
then
sir
accounts
for
this
way
seems
that
ere
wolf
escaped
simply
because
wanted
get
out
from
the
hearty
way
that
both
thomas
and
his
wife
laughed
the
joke
could
see
that
had
done
service
before
and
that
the
whole
explanation
was
simply
elaborate
sell
couldn
cope
badinage
with
the
worthy
thomas
but
thought
knew
surer
way
his
heart
said
now
bilder
consider
that
first
half
sovereign
worked
off
and
this
brother
his
waiting
claimed
when
you
told
what
you
think
will
happen
right
are
sir
said
briskly
excoose
know
for
chaffin
but
the
old
woman
here
winked
which
was
much
telling
well
never
said
the
old
lady
opinion
this
that
ere
wolf
idin
somewheres
the
gard
ner
wot
didn
remember
said
was
gallopin
northward
faster
than
horse
could
but
don
believe
him
for
yer
see
sir
wolves
don
gallop
more
nor
dogs
does
they
not
bein
built
that
way
wolves
fine
things
storybook
and
dessay
when
they
gets
packs
and
does
chivyin
somethin
that
more
afeared
than
they
they
can
make
devil
noise
and
chop
whatever
but

something
came
bobbing
against

length
with
surprise
god

most
unnecessary

always
thought
that
wild
animal
never
looks
well
when
some
obstacle
pronounced
durability
between
personal
experience
has
intensified
rather
than
diminished
that
idea
after
all
however
there
nothing
like
custom
for
neither
bilder
nor
his
wife
thought
any
more
the
wolf
than
should
dog
the

well
behaved
that

had
paralysed
london
and
set
all
the
children

and
was
received
and
petted
like
sort
vulpine
prodigal
son
old
bilder
examined
him
all
over
with
most
tender
solicitude
and
when
had
finished
with
his
penitent
said
there
knew
the
poor
old
chap
would
get
into
some
kind
trouble

howl
like
dog
but
more
fierce
and
deeper
went
the
window
and
looked
out
but
could
see
nothing
except
big
bat
which
had
evidently
been
buffeting
its
wings
against
the
window
went
back

again
but
determined
not
sleep
presently
the
door
opened
and
mother
looked

and
sat
she
said
even
more
sweetly

uneasy
about

came
into

and
lay
down
beside

did
not
take
off
her
dressing
gown

said
she
would
only
stay
while
and
then
back
her
own
bed
she
lay
there

and
hers
the
flapping
and
buffeting
came
the
window
again
she
was
startled
and
little
frightened
and
cried
out
what
that
tried
pacify
her
and
last
succeeded
and
she
lay
quiet
but
could
hear
her
poor
dear
heart
still
beating
terribly
after
while
there
was
the
low
howl
again
out
the
shrubbery
and
shortly
after
there
was
crash
the
window
and
lot
broken
glass
was
hurled
the
floor
the
window
blind
blew
back
with
the
wind
that
rushed
and
the
aperture
the
broken
panes
there
was
the
head
great
gaunt
grey
wolf
mother
cried
out
fright
and
struggled
into
sitting
posture
and
clutched
wildly
anything
that
would
help
her
amongst
other
things
she
clutched
the
wreath
flowers
that
van
helsing
insisted
wearing
round
neck
and
tore
away
from
for
second
two
she
sat
pointing
the
wolf
and
there
was
strange
and
horrible
gurgling
her
throat
then
she
fell
over
struck
with
lightning
and
her
head
hit
forehead
and
made
dizzy
for
moment
two
the
room
and
all
round
seemed
spin
round
kept
eyes
fixed
the
window
but
the
wolf
drew
his
head
back
and
whole
myriad
little
specks
seemed
come
blowing
through
the
broken
window
and
wheeling
and
circling
round
like
the
pillar
dust
that
travellers
describe
when
there
simoon
the
desert
tried
stir
but
there
was
some
spell
upon
and
dear
mother
poor
body
which
seemed
grow
cold
already
for
her
dear
heart
had
ceased
beat
weighed
down
and
remembered
more
for
while
the
time
did
not
seem
long
but
very
very
awful
till
recovered
consciousness
again
somewhere
near
passing
bell
was
tolling
the
dogs
all
round
the
neighbourhood
were
howling
and
our
shrubbery
seemingly
just
outside
nightingale
was
singing
was
dazed
and
stupid
with
pain
and
terror
and
weakness
but
the
sound
the
nightingale
seemed
like
the
voice
dead
mother
come
back
comfort
the
sounds
seemed
have
awakened
the
maids
too
for
could
hear
their
bare
feet
pattering
outside
door
called
them
and
they
came
and
when
they
saw
what
had
happened
and
what
was
that
lay
over
the
bed
they
screamed
out
the
wind
rushed
through
the
broken
window
and
the
door
slammed
they
lifted
off
the
body
dear
mother
and
laid
her
covered
with
sheet
the
bed
after
had
got
they
were
all
frightened
and
nervous
that
directed
them
the
dining
room
and
have
each
glass
wine
the
door
flew
open
for
instant
and
closed
again
the
maids
shrieked
and
then
went
body
the
dining
room
and
laid
what
flowers
had
dear
mother
breast
when
they
were
there
remembered
what
van
helsing
had
told
but
didn
like
remove
them
and
besides
would
have
some
the
servants
sit
with

surprised
that
the
maids
did
not
come
back
called
them
but
got
answer
went
the
dining
room
look
for
them
heart
sank
when
saw
what
had
happened
they
all
four
lay
helpless
the
floor
breathing
heavily
the
decanter
sherry
was
the
table
half
full
but
there
was
queer
acrid
smell
about
was
suspicious
and
examined
the
decanter
smelt
laudanum
and
looking
the
sideboard
found
that
the
bottle
which
mother
doctor
uses
for
her
did
use
was
empty
what
what
back
the
room
with
mother
cannot
leave
her
and
alone
save
for
the
sleeping
servants
whom
some
one
has
drugged
alone
with
the
dead
dare
not
out
for
can
hear
the
low
howl
the
wolf
through
the
broken
window
the
air
seems
full
specks
floating
and
circling
the
draught
from
the
window
and
the
lights
burn
blue
and
dim
what
god
shield
from
harm
this
night
shall
hide
this
paper

where
they
shall
find
when
they
come

gently
and
entered
the
room
how
shall
describe
what
saw

two
women

her
mother
the
latter
lay
farthest
and
she
was
covered
with
white
sheet
the
edge
which
had
been
blown
back
the
draught
through
the
broken
window
showing
the
drawn
white
face
with
look
terror
fixed
upon
her
side
lay
lucy
with
face
white
and
still
more
drawn
the
flowers
which
had
been
round
her
neck
found
upon
her
mother
bosom
and
her
throat
was
bare
showing
the
two
little
wounds
which
had
noticed
before
but
looking
horribly
white
and
mangled
without
word
the
professor
bent
over
the
bed
his
head
almost
touching
poor
lucy
breast
then
gave
quick
turn
his
head
one
who
listens
and
leaping
his
feet
cried
out
not
yet
too
late
quick
quick
bring

with
taking
care

and
taste
lest

drugged
like
the
decanter

found
the
table
the
maids
were
still
breathing
but
more
restlessly
and

narcotic
was
wearing

not
stay

sure
but
returned
van

evidently
affected
her
more
strongly
lifted
her

sofa
and
let
her
sleep
the
others
were
dazed
first
but
remembrance
came
back
them
they
cried
and

and
would
not

her
simply
tell

that

answered
way
that

not
understand
but
with
the
sternest
look
that
his
face
could
wear
that
were
all

stop
here
where
are
now
and
let
her
fade
away
into
peace
for
see
light
life
over
her
horizon
went
with
his
work
with
possible
renewed
and
more
frenzied
vigour
presently

conscious
that
the
heat
was
beginning

drops
brandy
down
her
throat
noticed
that
van
helsing
tied
soft
silk
handkerchief
round
her
throat

was
still
unconscious

one
the
women
and
told
her

carefully
behind

already
down
with
that
obedience
the
etiquette
death
which
the
british
woman
the
lower
classes
always
rigidly
observes
the

was
therefore
dimly
dark
was
however
light

our
purposes

somewhat
relieved

came
speak
about
the

and
that
paper
would
have
produced
hopes
that
need
have
inquest
for
had
would
surely
kill
poor
lucy
nothing
else
did
know
and
you
know
and
the
other
doctor
who
attended
her
knows
that
mrs
westenra
had
disease

heart
and
can
certify
that
she
died
let
fill
the
certificate
once
and
shall
take
myself

was
waiting
for
told

him
soon
knew
about
lucy
and
went
her
room
she
was
still
sleeping
and
the
professor
seemingly
had
not
moved
from
his
seat
her
side
from
his
putting
his
finger
his
lips
gathered
that
expected
her
wake
before
long
and
was
afraid
forestalling
nature
went
down
quincey
and
took
him
into
the
breakfast
room
where
the
blinds
were
not
drawn
down
and
which
was
little
more
cheerful
rather
less
cheerless
than
the
other
rooms
when
were
alone
said
jack
seward
don
want
shove
myself
anywhere
where
right
but
this
ordinary
case
you
know
loved
that
girl
and
wanted
marry
her
but
although
that
all
past
and
gone
can
help
feeling
anxious
about
her
all
the
same
what
that
wrong
with
her
the
dutchman
and
fine
old
fellow
can
see
that
said
that
time
you

into
the
room
that
you
must
have
another
transfusion
blood
and
that
both
you
and
were
exhausted
now
know
well
that
you
medical
men
speak
camera
and
that
man
must
not
expect
know
what
they
consult
about
private
but
this
common
matter
and
whatever
have
done
part
not
that
that
said
and
went
take
that
both
you
and
van
helsing
had
done
already
what
did
day

that
and
guess
art

too
when
saw

four
days
ago

his
own
place

and
the
vein
left
open
there
wasn
enough
blood
her
let
her
stand
and
had
put
bullet
through
her
she
lay
jack
you
may
tell
without
betraying
confidence
arthur
was
the
first
not
that
spoke
the
poor
fellow
looked
terribly
anxious
was
torture
suspense
regarding
the
woman
loved
and
his
utter
ignorance
the
terrible
mystery
which
seemed
surround
her
intensified
his
pain
his
very
heart
was
bleeding
and
took
all
the
manhood
him
and
there
was
royal
lot
too
keep
him
from
breaking
down
paused
before
answering
for
felt
that
must
not
betray
anything
which
the
professor
wished
kept
secret
but
already
knew
much
and
guessed
much
that
there
could
reason
for
not
answering
answered
the
same
phrase
that
and
how
long
has
this
been
going
about
ten
days
ten
days
then
guess
jack
seward
that
that
poor
pretty
creature
that
all
love
has
had
put
into
her
veins
within
that
time
the
blood
four
strong
men
man
alive
her
whole
body
wouldn
hold
then
coming
close
spoke
fierce
half
whisper
what
took
out
shook
head
that
said
the
crux
van
helsing
simply
frantic
about
and
wits
end
can
even
hazard
guess
there
has
been
series
little
circumstances
which
have
thrown
out
all
our
calculations
lucy
being
properly
watched
but
these
shall
not
occur
again
here
stay
until
all
well
ill
quincey
held
out
his
hand
count
said
you
and
the
dutchman
will
tell
what
and
when
she
woke
late
the
afternoon
lucy
first
movement
was
feel
her
breast
and
surprise
produced
the
paper
which
van
helsing
had
given
read
the
careful
professor
had
replaced
where
had
come
from
lest
waking
she
should
alarmed
her
eye
then
lit
van
helsing
and
too
and
gladdened
then
she
looked
around
the
room
and
seeing
where
she
was
shuddered
she
gave
loud
cry
and
put
her
poor
thin
hands
before
her
pale
face
both
understood
what
that
meant
that
she
had
realised
the
full
her
mother
death
tried
what
could
comfort
her
doubtless
sympathy
eased
her
somewhat
but
she
was
very
low
thought
and
spirit
and
wept
silently
and
weakly
for
long
time
told
her
that
either
both
would
now
remain
with
her
all
the
time
and
that
seemed
comfort
her
towards
dusk
she
fell
into
doze
here
very
odd
thing
occurred
whilst
still
asleep
she
took
the
paper
from
her
breast
and
tore
two
van
helsing
stepped
over
and
took
the
pieces
from
her
all
the
same
however
she
went
with
the
action
tearing
though
the
material
were
still
her
hands
finally
she
lifted
her
hands
and
opened
them
though
scattering
the
fragments
van
helsing
seemed
surprised
and
his
brows
gathered
thought
but
said
nothing
september
all
last
night
she
slept
fitfully
being
always
afraid
sleep
and
something
weaker
when
she
woke
from
the
professor
and
took
turns
watch
and
never
left
her
for
moment
unattended
quincey
morris
said
nothing
about
his
intention
but
knew
that
all
night
long
patrolled
round
and
round
the
house
when
the
day
came
its
searching
light
showed
the
ravages
poor
lucy
strength
she
was
hardly
able
turn
her
head
and
the
little
nourishment
which
she
could
take
seemed
her
good
times
she
slept
and
both
van
helsing
and
noticed
the
difference
her
between
sleeping
and
waking
whilst
asleep
she
looked
stronger
although
more
haggard
and
her
breathing
was
softer
her
open
mouth
showed
the
pale
gums
drawn
back
from
the
teeth
which
thus
looked
positively
longer
and
sharper
than
usual
when
she
woke
the
softness
her
eyes
evidently
changed
the
expression
for
she
looked
her
own
self
although
dying
one
the
afternoon
she
asked
for
arthur
and
telegraphed
for
him
quincey
went
off
meet
him
the
station
when
arrived
was
nearly
six
clock
and
the
sun
was
setting
full
and
warm
and
the
red
light
streamed
through
the
window
and
gave
more
colour
the
pale
cheeks
when
saw
her
arthur
was
simply
choking
with
emotion
and
none
could
speak
the
hours
that
had
passed
the
fits
sleep
the
comatose
condition
that
passed
for
had
grown
more
frequent
that
the
pauses
when
conversation
was
possible
were
shortened
arthur
presence
however
seemed
act
stimulant
she
rallied
little
and
spoke
him
more
brightly
than
she
had
done
since
arrived
too
pulled
himself
together
and
spoke
cheerily
could
that
the
best
was
made
everything
was
now
nearly
one
clock

renfield

more
say
has
had
another
outbreak
which
might
have
had
dreadful
ending
but
which
fortunately
happened
was
unattended
with
any
unhappy
results
this
afternoon
carrier
cart
with
two
men
made
call
the
empty
house
whose
grounds
abut
ours
the
house
which
you
will
remember
the
patient
twice
ran
away
the
men
stopped
our
gate
ask
the
porter
their
way
they
were
strangers

looking
out
the

having
smoke
after
dinner
and
saw
one
them
come
the
house
passed
the
window
renfield
room
the
patient
began
rate
him
from
within
and
called
him
all
the
foul
names
could
lay
his
tongue
the
man
who
seemed
decent
fellow
enough
contented
himself
telling
him
shut
for
foul
mouthed
beggar
whereon
our
man
accused
him
robbing
him
and
wanting
murder
him
and
said
that
would
hinder
him
were
swing
for
opened
the
window
and
signed
the
man
not
notice
contented
himself
after
looking
the
place
over
and
making
his
mind
what
kind
place
had
got
saying
lor
bless
yer
sir
wouldn
mind
what
was
said
bloomin
madhouse
pity
and
the
guv
nor
for
havin
live
the

with
wild
beast
like
that
then
asked
his
way
civilly
enough
and
told
him
where
the
gate
the
empty
house
was
went
away
followed
threats
and
curses
and
revilings
from
our
man
went
down
see
could
make
out
any
cause
for
his
anger
since
usually
such
well
behaved
man
and
except
his
violent
fits
nothing
the
kind
had
ever
occurred
found
him
astonishment
quite
composed
and
most
genial
his
manner
tried
get
him
talk
the
incident
but
blandly
asked
questions
what
meant
and
led
believe
that
was
completely
oblivious
the
affair
was
sorry
say
however
only
another
instance
his
cunning
for
within
half
hour
heard
him
again
this
time
had
broken
out
through
the
window
his
room
and
was
running
down
the
avenue
called
the
attendants
follow
and
ran
after
him
for
feared
was
intent
some
mischief
fear
was
justified
when
saw
the
same
cart
which
had
passed
before
coming
down
the
road
having
some
great
wooden
boxes
the
men
were
wiping
their
foreheads
and
were
flushed
the
face
with
violent
exercise
before
could
get
him
the
patient
rushed
them
and
pulling
one
them
off
the
cart
began
knock
his
head
against
the
ground
had
not
seized
him
just
the
moment
believe
would
have
killed
the
man
there
and
then
the
other
fellow
jumped
down
and
struck
him
over
the
head
with
the
butt
end
his
heavy
whip
was
terrible
blow
but
did
not
seem
mind
but
seized
him
also
and
struggled
with
the
three
pulling
and
fro
were
kittens
you
know
light
weight
and
the
others
were
both
burly
men
first
was
silent
his
fighting
but
began
master
him
and
the
attendants
were
putting
strait
waistcoat
him
began
shout
frustrate
them
they
shan
rob
they
shan
murder
inches
fight
for
lord
and
master
and
all
sorts
similar
incoherent
ravings
was
with
very
considerable
difficulty
that
they
got
him
back
the
house
and
put
him
the
padded
room
one
the
attendants
hardy
had
finger
broken
however
set
all
right
and
going
well
the
two
carriers
were
first
loud
their
threats
actions
for
damages
and
promised
rain
all
the
penalties
the
law
their
threats
were
however
mingled
with
some
sort
indirect
apology
for
the
defeat
the
two
them
feeble
madman
they
said
that
had
not
been
for
the
way
their
strength
had
been
spent
carrying
and
raising
the
heavy
boxes
the
cart
they
would
have
made
short
work
him
they
gave
another
reason
for
their
defeat
the
extraordinary
state
drouth
which
they
had
been
reduced
the
dusty
nature
their
occupation
and
the
reprehensible
distance
from
the
scene
their
labours
any
place
public
entertainment
quite
understood
their
drift
and
after
stiff
glass
grog
rather
more
the
same
and
with
each
sovereign
hand
they
made
light
the
attack
and
swore
that
they

was
only
when

that

and
that

not
all
break
down
for

arthur
went
off
with
him
casting
back
longing
look
lucy
face
which
lay
her
pillow
almost
whiter
than
the
lawn
she
lay
quite
still
and
looked
round
the
room
see
that
all
was
should
could
see
that
the
professor
had
carried
out
this
room
the
other
his
purpose
using
the
garlic
the
whole
the
window
sashes
reeked
with
and
round
lucy
neck
over
the
silk
handkerchief
which
van
helsing
made
her
keep
was
rough
chaplet
the
same
odorous
flowers
lucy
was
breathing
somewhat
stertorously
and
her
face
was
its
worst
for
the
open
mouth
showed
the
pale
gums
her
teeth
the
dim
uncertain
light
seemed
longer
and
sharper
than
they
had
been
the
morning
particular
some
trick
the
light
the
canine
teeth
looked
longer
and
sharper
than
the
rest
sat
down
her
and
presently
she
moved
uneasily
the
same
moment
there
came
sort
dull
flapping
buffeting
the
window
went
over
softly
and
peeped
out
the
corner
the
blind
there
was
full
moonlight
and
could
see
that
the
noise
was
made
great
bat
which
wheeled
round
doubtless
attracted
the
light
although
dim
and
every
now
and
again
struck
the
window
with
its
wings
when
came
back
seat
found
that
lucy
had
moved
slightly
and
had
torn
away
the
garlic
flowers
from
her
throat
replaced
them
well
could
and
sat
watching
her
presently
she
woke
and
gave
her
food
van
helsing
had
prescribed
she
took
but
little
and
that
languidly
there
did
not
seem
with
her
now
the
unconscious
struggle
for
life
and
strength
that
had
hitherto
marked
her
illness
struck
curious
that
the
moment
she
became
conscious
she
pressed
the
garlic
flowers
close
her
was
certainly
odd
that
whenever
she
got
into
that
lethargic
state
with
the
stertorous
breathing
she
put
the
flowers
from
her
but
that
when
she
waked
she
clutched
them
close
there
was
possibility
making
any
mistake
about
this
for
the
long
hours
that
followed
she
had
many
spells
sleeping
and
waking
and
repeated
both
actions
many
times
six
clock
van
helsing
came
relieve
arthur
had
then
fallen
into
doze
and
mercifully
let
him
sleep
when
saw
lucy
face
could
hear
the
sissing
indraw
his
breath
and
said
sharp
whisper
draw
the
blind
want
light
then
bent
down
and
with
his
face
almost
touching
lucy
examined
her
carefully
removed
the
flowers
and
lifted
the
silk
handkerchief
from
her
throat
did
started
back
and
could
hear
his
ejaculation
mein
gott
was
smothered
his
throat
bent
over
and
looked
too
and
noticed
some
queer
chill
came
over
the
wounds
the
throat
had
absolutely
disappeared
for
fully
five
minutes
van
helsing
stood
looking
her
with
his
face
its
sternest
then
turned
and
said
calmly
she
dying
will
not
long
now
will
much
difference
mark
whether
she
dies
conscious
her
sleep
wake
that
poor
boy
and
let
him
come
and
see
the
last
trusts
and
have
promised
him
went
the
dining
room
and
waked
him
was
dazed
for
moment
but
when
saw
the
sunlight
streaming
through
the
edges
the
shutters
thought
was
late
and
expressed
his
fear
assured
him
that
lucy
was
still
asleep
but
told
him
gently
could
that
both
van
helsing
and
feared
that
the
end
was
near
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
slid
down
his
knees
the
sofa
where
remained
perhaps
minute
with
his
head
buried
praying
whilst
his
shoulders
shook
with
grief
took
him
the
hand
and
raised
him
come
said
dear
old
fellow
summon
all
your
fortitude
will
best
and
easiest
for
her
when
came
into
lucy
room
could
see
that
van
helsing
had
with
his
usual
forethought
been
putting
matters
straight
and
making
everything
look
pleasing
possible
had
even
brushed
lucy
hair
that
lay
the
pillow
its
usual
sunny
ripples
when
came
into
the
room
she
opened
her
eyes
and
seeing
him
whispered
softly
arthur
love
glad
you
have
come
was
stooping
kiss
her
when
van
helsing
motioned
him
back
whispered
not
yet
hold
her
hand
will
comfort
her
more
arthur
took
her
hand
and
knelt
beside
her
and
she
looked
her
best
with
all
the
soft
lines
matching
the
angelic
beauty
her
eyes
then
gradually
her
eyes
closed
and
she
sank
sleep
for
little
bit
her
breast
heaved
softly
and
her
breath
came
and
went
like
tired
child
and
then
insensibly
there
came
the
strange
change
which
had
noticed
the
night
her
breathing
grew
stertorous
the
mouth
opened
and
the
pale
gums
drawn
back
made
the
teeth
look
longer
and
sharper
than
ever
sort
sleep
waking
vague
unconscious
way
she
opened
her
eyes
which
were
now
dull
and
hard
once
and
said
soft
voluptuous
voice
such
had
never
heard
from
her
lips
arthur
love
glad
you
have
come
kiss
arthur
bent
eagerly
over
kiss
her
but
that
instant
van
helsing
who
like
had
been
startled
her
voice
swooped
upon
him
and
catching
him
the
neck
with
both
hands
dragged
him
back
with
fury
strength
which
never
thought
could
have
possessed
and
actually
hurled
him
almost
across
the
room
not
for
your
life
said
not
for
your
living
soul
and
hers
and
stood
between
them
like
lion
bay
arthur
was
taken
aback
that
did
not
for
moment
know
what
say
and
before
any
impulse
violence
could
seize
him
realised
the
place
and
the
occasion
and
stood
silent
waiting
kept
eyes
fixed
lucy
did
van
helsing
and
saw
spasm
rage
flit
like
shadow
over
her
face
the
sharp
teeth
champed
together
then
her
eyes
closed
and
she
breathed
heavily
very
shortly
after
she
opened
her
eyes
all
their
softness
and
putting
out
her
poor
pale
thin
hand
took
van
helsing
great
brown
one
drawing
her
she
kissed
true
friend
she
said
faint
voice
but
with
untellable
pathos
true
friend
and
his
guard
him
and
give
peace
swear
said
solemnly
kneeling
beside
her
and
holding
his
hand
one
who
registers
oath
then
turned
arthur
and
said
him
come
child
take
her
hand
yours
and
kiss
her
the
forehead
and
only
once
their
eyes
met
instead
their
lips
and
they
parted
lucy
eyes
closed
and
van
helsing
who
had
been
watching
closely
took
arthur
arm
and
drew
him
away
and
then
lucy
breathing
became
stertorous
again
and
all
once
ceased
all
over
said
van
helsing
she
dead
took
arthur
the
arm
and
led
him
away
the
drawing
room
where
sat
down
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
sobbing
way
that
nearly
broke
down
see
went
back
the
room
and
found
van
helsing
looking
poor
lucy
and
his
face
was
sterner
than
ever
some
change
had
come
over
her
body
death
had
given
back
part
her
beauty
for
her
brow
and
cheeks
had
recovered
some
their
flowing
lines
even
the
lips
had
lost
their
deadly
pallor
was
the
blood
longer
needed
for
the
working
the
heart
had
gone
make
the
harshness
death
little
rude
might
thought
her
dying
whilst
she
slept
and
sleeping
when
she
died
stood
beside
van
helsing
and
said
well
poor
girl
there
peace
for
her
last
the
end
turned
and
said
with
grave
solemnity
not
alas
not
only
the
beginning
when
asked
him
what
meant
only
shook
his
head
and
answered
can
nothing
yet
wait
and
see
chapter
xiii
seward
diary
continued
the
funeral
was
arranged
for
the
next
succeeding
day
that
lucy
and
her
mother
might
buried
together
attended
all
the
ghastly
formalities
and
the
urbane
undertaker
proved
that
his
staff
were
afflicted
blessed
with
something
his
own
obsequious
suavity
even
the
woman
who
performed
the
last
offices
for

that

never
kept

was
possible
from

insisted
upon
looking
over
lucy
papers
himself
asked
him
why

feared
that

not
quite
aware
english
legal
requirements

might
ignorance
make
some
unnecessary
trouble
answered

paused
moment
and

solemnly
friend

there

and
terrible
days

end
will
you
not
have
faith
took
his
hand
and
promised
him
held
door
open
went
away
and
watched
him
into
his
room
and
close
the
door
stood
without
moving
saw
one
the
maids
pass
silently
along
the
passage
she
had
her
back
towards
did
not
see
and
into
the
room
where
lucy
lay
the
sight
touched
devotion
rare
and
are
grateful
those
who
show
unasked
those
love
here
was
poor
girl
putting
aside
the
terrors
which
she
naturally
had
death
watch
alone
the
bier
the
mistress
whom
she
loved
that
the
poor
clay
might
not
lonely
till
laid
eternal
rest
must
have
slept
long
and
soundly
for
was
broad
daylight
when
van
helsing
waked
coming
into
room
came
over
bedside
and
said
you
need
not
trouble
about
the
knives
shall
not
why
not
asked
for
his
solemnity
the
night
before
had
greatly
impressed
because
said
sternly
too
late
too
early
see
here
held
the
little
golden
crucifix
this
was
stolen
the
night
how
stolen
asked
wonder
since
you
have
now
because
get
back
from
the
worthless
wretch
who
stole
from
the
woman
who
robbed
the
dead
and
the
living
her
punishment
will
surely
come
but
not
through
she
knew
not
altogether
what
she
did
and
thus
unknowing
she
only
stole
now
must
wait
went
away
the
word
leaving
with
new
mystery
think
new
puzzle
grapple
with
the
forenoon
was
dreary
time
but
noon
the
solicitor
came
marquand
wholeman
sons
marquand
lidderdale
was
very
genial
and
very
appreciative
what
had
done
and
took
off
our
hands
all
cares
details
during
lunch
told
that
mrs
westenra
had
for
some
time
expected
sudden
death
from
her
heart
and
had
put
her
affairs
absolute
order
informed
that
with
the
exception
certain
entailed
property
lucy
father
which
now
default
direct
issue
went
back
distant
branch
the
family
the
whole
estate
real
and
personal
was
left
absolutely
arthur
holmwood
when
had
told
much
went
frankly
did
our
best
prevent
such
testamentary
disposition
and
pointed
out
certain
contingencies
that
might
leave
her
daughter
either
penniless
not
free
she
should
act
regarding
matrimonial
alliance
indeed
pressed
the
matter
far
that
almost
came
into
collision
for
she
asked
were
were
not
prepared
carry
out
her
wishes
course
had
then
alternative
but
accept
were
right
principle
and
ninety
nine
times
out
hundred
should
have
proved
the
logic
events
the
accuracy
our
judgment
frankly
however
must
admit
that
this
case
any
other
form
disposition
would
have
rendered
impossible
the
carrying
out
her
wishes
for
her
predeceasing
her
daughter
the
latter
would
have
come
into
possession
the
property
and
even
had
she
only
survived
her
mother
five
minutes
her
property
would
case
there
were
will
and
will
was
practical
impossibility
such
case
have
been
treated
her
decease
under
intestacy
which
case
lord
godalming
though
dear
friend
would
have
had
claim
the
world
and
the
inheritors
being
remote
would
not
likely
abandon
their
just
rights
for
sentimental
reasons
regarding
entire
stranger
assure
you
dear
sirs
rejoiced
the
result
perfectly
rejoiced
was
good
fellow
but
his
rejoicing
the
one
little
part
which
was
officially
interested
great
tragedy
was
object
lesson
the
limitations
sympathetic
understanding
did
not
remain
long
but
said
would
look
later
the
day
and
see
lord
godalming
his
coming
however
had
been
certain
comfort
since
assured
that
should
not
have
dread
hostile
criticism
any
our
acts
arthur
was
expected
five
clock
little
before
that
time
visited
the
death
chamber
was
very
truth
for
now
both
mother
and
daughter
lay
the
undertaker
true
his
craft
had
made
the
best
display
could
his
goods
and
there
was
mortuary
air
about
the
place
that
lowered
our
spirits
once
van
helsing
ordered
the
former
arrangement
adhered
explaining
that
lord
godalming
was
coming
very
soon
would
less
harrowing
his
feelings
see
all
that
was
left
his
fiancee
quite
alone
the
undertaker
seemed
shocked
his
own
stupidity
and
exerted
himself
restore
things
the
condition
which
left
them
the
night
before
that
when
arthur
came
such
shocks
his
feelings
could
avoid
were
saved
poor
fellow
looked
desperately
sad
and
broken
even
his
stalwart
manhood
seemed
have
shrunk
somewhat
under
the
strain
his
much
tried
emotions
had
knew
been
very
genuinely
and
devotedly
attached
his
father
and
lose
him
and
such
time
was
bitter
blow
him
with
was
warm
ever
and
van
helsing
was
sweetly
courteous
but
could
not
help
seeing
that
there
was
some
constraint
with
him
the
professor
noticed
too
and
motioned
bring
him
upstairs
did
and
left
him
the
door
the
room
felt
would
like
quite
alone
with
her
but
took
arm
and
led
saying
huskily
you
loved
her
too
old
fellow
she
told
all
about
and
there
was
friend
had
closer
place
her
heart
than
you
don
know
how
thank
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
her
can
think
yet
here
suddenly
broke
down
and
threw
his
arms
round
shoulders
and
laid
his
head
breast
crying
jack
jack
what
shall
the
whole
life
seems
gone
from
all
once
and
there
nothing
the
wide
world
for
live
for
comforted
him
well
could
such
cases
men
not
need
much
expression
grip
the
hand
the
tightening
arm
over
the
shoulder
sob
unison
are
expressions
sympathy
dear
man
heart
stood
still
and
silent
till
his
sobs
died
away
and
then
said
softly
him
come
and
look
her
together
moved
over
the
bed
and
lifted
the
lawn
from
her
face
god
how
beautiful
she
was
every
hour
seemed
enhancing
her
loveliness
frightened
and
amazed
somewhat
and
for
arthur
fell
trembling
and
finally
was
shaken
with
doubt
with
ague
last
after
long
pause
said
faint
whisper
jack
she
really
dead
assured
him
sadly
that
was
and
went
suggest
for
felt
that
such
horrible
doubt
should
not
have
life
for
moment
longer
than
could
help
that
often
happened
that
after
death
faces
became
softened
and
even
resolved
into
their
youthful
beauty
that
this
was
especially
when
death
had
been
preceded
any
acute
prolonged
suffering
seemed
quite
away
with
any
doubt
and
after
kneeling
beside
the
couch
for
while
and
looking
her
lovingly
and
long
turned
aside
told
him
that
that
must
good
bye
the
coffin
had
prepared
went
back
and
took
her
dead
hand
his
and
kissed
and
bent
over
and
kissed
her
forehead
came
away
fondly
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
her
came
left
him
the
drawing
room
and
told
van
helsing
that
had
said
good
bye
the
latter
went
the
kitchen
tell
the
undertaker
men
proceed
with
the
preparations
and
screw
the
coffin
when
came
out
the
room
again
told
him
arthur
question
and
replied
not
surprised
just
now
doubted
for
moment
myself
all
dined
together
and
could
see
that
poor
art
was
trying
make
the
best
things
van
helsing
had
been
silent
all
dinner
time
but
when
had
lit
our
cigars
said
lord
but
arthur
interrupted
him
not
that
for
god
sake
not
yet
any
rate
forgive
sir
did
not
mean
speak
offensively
only
because
loss
recent
the
professor
answered
very
sweetly
only
used
that
name
because
was
doubt
must
not
call
you
and
have
grown
love
you
yes
dear
boy
love
you
arthur
arthur
held
out
his
hand
and
took
the
old
man
warmly
call
what
you
will
said
hope
may
always
have
the
title
friend
and
let
say
that
loss
for
words
thank
you
for
your
goodness
poor
dear
paused
moment
and
went
know
that
she
understood
your
goodness
even
better
than
and
was
rude
any
way
wanting
that
time
you
acted
you
remember
the
professor
nodded
you
must
forgive
answered
with
grave
kindness
know
was
hard
for
you
quite
trust
then
for
trust
such
violence
needs
understand
and
take
that
you
not
that
you
cannot
trust
now
for
you
not
yet
understand
and
there
may
more
times
when
shall
want
you
trust
when
you
cannot
and
may
not
and
must
not
yet
understand
but
the
time
will
come
when
your
trust
shall
whole
and
complete
and
when
you
shall
understand
though
the
sunlight
himself
shone
through
then
you
shall
bless
from
first
last
for
your
own
sake
and
for
the
sake
others
and
for
her
dear
sake
whom
swore
protect
and
indeed

said
arthur
warmly

and
believe
you
have
very
noble
heart
and
you
are
jack
friend
and
you
were
hers
you
shall
what
you
like
the
professor
cleared
his
throat
couple
times
though
about
speak
and
finally
said
may
ask
you
something
now
certainly
you
know
that
mrs
westenra
left
you
all
her
property

thought
and

that

into
her
soul

solemnly

that
night

all
went
and
fro
patrolling
the

and
was
never
out

the
room
where
lucy
lay
her
coffin
strewn
with
the
wild
garlic
flowers
which
sent
through
the

the

exeter
jonathan
sleeping
seems
only
yesterday
that
the
last
entry
was
made
and
yet
how
much
between
then
whitby
and
all
the
world
before
jonathan
away
and
news
him
and
now
married
jonathan
jonathan

rich

his

hawkins
dead
and
buried
and
jonathan
with
another
attack
that
may
harm
him
some
day
may
ask
about
down
all
goes
rusty
shorthand
see
what
unexpected
prosperity
does
for
may
well
freshen
again
with
exercise
anyhow
the
service
was
very
simple
and
very
solemn
there
were
only
ourselves
and
the
servants
there
one
two
old
friends
his
from
exeter
his
london
agent
and
gentleman
representing
sir
john
paxton
the
president
the
incorporated
law
society
jonathan
and
stood
hand
hand
and
felt
that
our
best
and
dearest
friend
was
gone
from
came
back
town
quietly
taking
bus
hyde
park
corner
jonathan
thought
would
interest
into
the
row
for
while
sat
down
but
there
were
very
few
people
there
and
was
sad
looking
and
desolate
see
many
empty
chairs
made
think
the
empty
chair
home
got
and
walked
down
piccadilly
jonathan
was
holding
the
arm
the
way
used
old
days
before
went
school
felt
very
improper
for
you
can
for
some
years
teaching
etiquette
and
decorum
other
girls
without
the
pedantry
biting
into
yourself
bit
but
was
jonathan
and
was
husband
and
didn
know
anybody
who
saw
and
didn
care
they
did
walked
was
looking
very
beautiful
girl
big
cart
wheel
hat
sitting
victoria
outside
guiliano
when
felt
jonathan
clutch
arm
tight
that
hurt
and
said
under
his
breath
god
always
anxious
about
jonathan
for
fear
that
some
nervous
fit
may
upset
him
again
turned
him
quickly
and
asked
him
what
was
that
disturbed
him
was
very
pale
and
his
eyes
seemed
bulging
out
half
terror
and
half
amazement
gazed
tall
thin
man
with
beaky
nose
and
black
moustache
and
pointed
beard
who
was
also
observing
the
pretty
girl
was
looking
her
hard
that
did
not
see
either
and
had
good
view
him
his
face
was
not
good
face
was
hard
and
cruel
and
sensual
and
his
big
white
teeth
that
looked
all
the
whiter
because
his
lips
were
red
were
pointed
like
animal
jonathan
kept
staring
him
till
was
afraid
would
notice
feared
might
take
ill
looked
fierce
and
nasty
asked
jonathan
why
was
disturbed
and
answered
evidently
thinking
that
knew
much
about
did
you
see
who
dear
said
don
know
him
who
his
answer
seemed
shock
and
thrill
for
was
said
did
not
know
that
was
mina
whom
was
speaking
the
man
himself
the
poor
dear
was
evidently
terrified
something
very
greatly
terrified
believe
that
had
not
had
lean
and
support
him
would
have
sunk
down
kept
staring
man
came
out
the
shop
with
small
parcel
and
gave
the
lady
who
then
drove
off
the
dark
man
kept
his
eyes
fixed
her
and
when
the
carriage
moved
piccadilly
followed
the
same
direction
and
hailed
hansom
jonathan
kept
looking
after
him
and
said
himself
believe
the
count
but
has
grown
young
god
this
god
god
only
knew
only
knew
was
distressing
himself
much
that
feared
keep
his
mind
the
subject
asking
him
any
questions
remained
silent
drew
him
away
quietly
and
holding
arm
came
easily
walked
little
further
and
then
went
and
sat
for
while
the
green
park
was
hot
day
for
autumn
and
there
was
comfortable
seat
shady
place
after
few
minutes
staring
nothing
jonathan
eyes
closed
and
went
quietly
into
sleep
with
his
head
shoulder
thought
was
the
best
thing
for
him
did
not
disturb
him
about
twenty
minutes
woke
and
said
quite
cheerfully
why
mina
have
been
asleep
forgive
for
being
rude
come
and
have
cup
tea
somewhere
had
evidently
forgotten
all
about
the
dark
stranger
his
illness
had
forgotten
all
that
this
episode
had
reminded
him
don
like
this
lapsing
into
forgetfulness
may
make
continue
some
injury
the
brain
must
not
ask
him
for
fear
shall
more
harm
than
good
but
must
somehow
learn
the
facts
his
journey
abroad
the
time
come
fear
when
must
open
that
parcel
and
know
what
written
jonathan

will
know

wrong

your
own
dear
sake

see
putting
some
terrible
restraint
himself
when
was
all
over

standing
beside
arthur

poor
fellow
was
speaking
his
part
the
operation
where
his

arthur
and
quincey
went
away
together

station
and
van
helsing
and
came
here
the
moment
were
alone
the
carriage
gave
way
regular
fit
hysterics
has
denied
since
that
was
hysterics
and
insisted
that
was
only
his
sense
humour
asserting
itself
under
very
terrible
conditions
laughed
till
cried
and
had
draw
down
the
blinds
lest
any
one
should
see
and
misjudge
and
then
cried
till
laughed
again
and
laughed
and
cried
together
just
woman
does
tried
stern
with
him
one
woman
under
the
circumstances
but
had
effect
men
and
women
are
different
manifestations
nervous
strength
weakness
then
when
his
face
grew
grave
and
stern
again
asked
him
why
his
mirth
and
why
such
time
his
reply
was
way
characteristic
him
for
was
logical
and
forceful
and
mysterious
said
you
don
comprehend
friend
john
not
think
that
not
sad
though
laugh
see
have
cried
even
when
the
laugh
did
choke
but
more
think
that
all
sorry
when
cry
for
the
laugh
come
just
the
same
keep
always
with
you
that
laughter
who
knock
your
door
and
say
may
come
not
the
true
laughter
king
and
come
when
and
how
like
ask
person
choose
time
suitability
say
here
behold
example
grieve
heart
out
for
that
sweet
young
girl
give
blood
for
her
though
old
and
worn
give
time
skill
sleep
let
other
sufferers
want
that
she
may
have
all
and
yet
can
laugh
her
very
grave
laugh
when
the
clay
from
the
spade
the
sexton
drop
upon
her
coffin
and
say
thud
thud
heart
till
send
back
the
blood
from
cheek
heart
bleed
for
that
poor
boy
that
dear
boy
the
age
mine
own
boy
had
been
blessed
that
live
and
with
his
hair
and
eyes
the
same
there
you
know
now
why
love
him
and
yet
when
say
things
that
touch
husband
heart
the
quick
and
make
father
heart
yearn
him
other
man
not
even
you
friend
john
for
are
more
level
experiences
than
father
and
son
yet
even
such
moment
king
laugh
come
and
shout
and
bellow
ear
here
here
till
the
blood
come
dance
back
and
bring
some
the
sunshine
that
carry
with
him
cheek
friend
john
strange
world
sad
world
world
full
miseries
and
woes
and
troubles
and
yet
when
king
laugh
come
make
them
all
dance
the
tune
play
bleeding
hearts
and
dry
bones
the
churchyard
and
tears
that
burn
they
fall
all
dance
together
the
music
that
make
with
that
smileless
mouth
him
and
believe
friend
john
that
good
come
and
kind
men
and
women
are
like
ropes
drawn
tight
with
strain
that
pull
different
ways
then
tears
come
and
like
the
rain
the
ropes
they
brace
until
perhaps
the
strain
become
too
great
and
break
but
king
laugh
come
like
the
sunshine
and
ease
off
the
strain
again
and
bear
with
our
labour
what
may
did
not
like
wound
him
pretending
not
see
his
idea
but
did
not
yet
understand
the
cause
his
laughter
asked
him
answered
his
face
grew
stern
and
said
quite
different
tone
was
the
grim
irony
all
this
lovely
lady
garlanded
with
flowers
that
looked
fair
life
till
one
one
wondered
she
were
truly
dead
she
laid
that
fine
marble
house
that
lonely
churchyard
where
rest
many
her
kin
laid
there
with
the
mother
who
loved
her
and
whom
she
loved
and
that
sacred
bell
going
toll
toll
toll
sad
and
slow
and
those
holy
men
with
the
white
garments
the
angel
pretending
read
books
and
yet
all
the
time
their
eyes
never
the
page
and
all
with
the
bowed
head
and
all
for
what
she
dead
not
well
for
the
life
professor
said
can
see
anything
laugh
all
that
why
your
explanation
makes
harder
puzzle
than
before
but
even
the
burial
service
was
comic
what
about
poor
art
and
his
trouble
why
his
heart
was
simply
breaking
just
said
not
that
the
transfusion
his
blood
her
veins
had
made
her
truly
his
bride
yes
and
was
sweet
and
comforting
idea
for
him
quite
but
there
was
difficulty
friend
john
that
then
what
about
the
others
then
this
sweet
maid
polyandrist
and
with
poor
wife
dead
but
alive
church
law
though
wits
all
gone
even
who
faithful
husband
this
now
wife
bigamist
don
see
where
the
joke
comes
there
either
said
and
did
not
feel
particularly
pleased
with
him
for
saying
such
things
laid
his
hand
arm
and
said
friend
john
forgive
pain
showed
not
feeling
others
when
would
wound
but
only
you
old
friend
whom
can
trust
you
could
have
looked
into
very
heart
then
when
want
laugh
you
could
have
done
when
the
laugh
arrived
you
could
now
when
king
laugh
have
pack
his
crown
and
all
that
him
for
far
far
away
from
and
for
long
long
time
maybe
you
would
perhaps
pity
the
most
all
was
touched
the
tenderness
his
tone
and
asked
why
because
know
and
now
are
all
scattered
and
for
many
long
day
loneliness
will
sit
over
our
roofs
with
brooding
wings
lucy
lies
the
tomb
her
kin
lordly
death
house
lonely
churchyard
away
from
teeming

headlines
the

horror
the

black
during
the
past
two

days
several
cases
have
occurred
young
children
straying
from
home
neglecting
return
from
their
playing
the
heath
all
these
cases
the
children
were
too
young
give
any
properly
intelligible
account
themselves
but
the
consensus
their
excuses
that
they
had
been
with
bloofer
lady
has
always
been
late
the
evening
when
they
have
been
missed
and
two
occasions
the
children
have
not
been
found
until
early
the
following
morning
generally
supposed
the
neighbourhood
that
the
first
child
missed
gave
his
reason
for
being
away
that

had
asked
him
come
for
walk
the
others

picked
the
phrase

might
says
take
lesson
the
irony
grotesque
comparing
the
reality
and
the

only

with
general

human
nature
that
the

should

naively
says
that
even
ellen
terry
could
not
winningly
attractive
some
these
grubby

little

pretend
and
even
imagine
themselves
there
however

serious
side
the
question
for
some
the

indeed
all
who

have

torn

how
your

the
previous
night
and
while
were
talking
the
carriage
window
waiting
for
the
train
start
was
turning
them
over
his
eyes
suddenly
seemed
catch
something
one
them
the
westminster
gazette
knew
the
colour
and
grew
quite
white
read
something
intently
groaning
himself
mein
gott
mein
gott
soon
soon
not
think
remembered
the
moment
just
then
the
whistle
blew
and
the
train
moved
off
this
recalled
him
himself
and
leaned
out
the
window
and
waved
his
hand
calling
out
love
madam
mina
shall
write
soon
ever
can
seward
diary
september
truly
there
such
thing
finality
not
week
since
said
finis
and
yet
here
starting
fresh
again
rather
going
with
the
same
record
until
this
afternoon
had
cause
think
what
done
renfield
had
become
all
intents
sane
ever
was
was
already
well
ahead
with
his
fly
business
and
had
just
started
the
spider
line
also
had
not
been
any
trouble
had
letter
from
arthur
written
sunday
and
from
gather
that
bearing
wonderfully
well
quincey
morris
with
him
and
that
much
help
for
himself
bubbling
well
good
spirits
quincey
wrote
line
too
and
from
him
hear
that
arthur
beginning
recover
something
his
old
buoyancy
them
all
mind
rest
for
myself
was
settling
down
work
with
the
enthusiasm
which
used
have
for
that
might
fairly
have
said
that
the
wound
which
poor
lucy
left
was
becoming
cicatrised
everything
however
now
reopened
and
what
the
end
god
only
knows
have
idea
that
van
helsing
thinks
knows
too
but
will
only
let
out
enough
time
whet
curiosity
went
exeter
yesterday
and
stayed
there
all
night
day
came
back
and
almost
bounded
into
the
room
about
half
past
five
clock
and
thrust
last
night
westminster
gazette
into
hand
what
you
think
that
asked
stood
back
and
folded
his
arms
looked
over
the
paper
for
really
did
not
know
what
meant
but
took
from
and
pointed
out
paragraph
about
children
being
decoyed
away
hampstead
did
not
convey
much
until
reached
passage
where
described
small
punctured
wounds
their
throats
idea
struck
and
looked
well
said
like
poor
lucy
and
what
you
make
simply
that
there
some
cause
common
whatever
was
that
injured
her
has
injured
them
did
not
quite
understand
his
answer
that
true
indirectly
but
not
directly
how
you
mean
professor
asked
was
little
inclined
take
his
seriousness
lightly
for
after
all
four
days
rest
and
freedom
from
burning
harrowing
anxiety
does
help
restore
one
spirits
but
when
saw
his
face
sobered
never
even
the
midst
our
despair
about
poor
lucy
had
looked
more
stern
tell
said
can
hazard
opinion
not
know
what
think
and
have
data
which
found
conjecture
you
mean
tell
friend
john
that
you
have
suspicion
what
poor
lucy
died
not
after
all
the
hints
given
not
only
events
but
nervous
prostration
following
great
loss
waste
blood
and
how
the
blood
lost
waste
shook
head
stepped
over
and
sat
down
beside
and
went
you
are
clever
man
friend
john
you
reason
well
and
your
wit
bold
but
you
are
too
prejudiced
you
not
let
your
eyes
see
nor
your
ears
hear
and
that
which
outside
your
daily
life
not
account
you
you
not
think
that
there
are
things
which
you
cannot
understand
and
yet
which
are
that
some
people
see
things
that
others
cannot
but
there
are
things
old
and
new
which
must
not
contemplate
men
eyes
because
they
know
think
they
know
some
things
which
other
men
have
told
them
the
fault
our
science
that
wants
explain
all
and
explain
not
then
says
there
nothing
explain
but
yet
see
around
every
day
the
growth
new
beliefs
which
think
themselves
new
and
which
are
yet
but
the
old
which
pretend
young
like
the
fine
ladies
the
opera
suppose
now
you
not
believe
corporeal
transference
nor
materialisation
nor
astral
bodies
nor
the
reading
thought
nor
hypnotism
yes
said
charcot
has
proved
that
pretty
well
smiled
went
then
you
are
satisfied
yes
and
course
then
you
understand
how
act
and
can
follow
the
mind
the
great
charcot
alas
that
more
into
the
very
soul
the
patient
that
influence
then
friend
john
take
that
you
simply
accept
fact
and
are
satisfied
let
from
premise
conclusion
blank
then
tell
for
student
the
brain
how
you
accept
the
hypnotism
and
reject
the
thought
reading
let
tell
you
friend
that
there
are
things
done
day
electrical
science
which
would
have
been
deemed
unholy
the
very
men
who
discovered
electricity
who
would
themselves
not
long
before
have
been
burned
wizards
there
are
always
mysteries
life
why
was
that
methuselah
lived
nine
hundred
years
and
old
parr
one
hundred
and
sixty
nine
and
yet
that
poor
lucy
with
four
men
blood
her
poor
veins
could
not
live
even
one
day
for
had
she
live
one
more
day
could
have
save
her
you
know
all
the
mystery
life
and
death
you
know
the
altogether
comparative
anatomy
and
can
say
wherefore
the
qualities
brutes
are
some
men
and
not
others
can
you
tell
why
when
other
spiders
die
small
and
soon
that
one
great
spider
lived
for
centuries
the
tower
the
old
spanish
church
and
grew
and
grew
till
descending
could
drink
the
oil
all
the
church
lamps
can
you
tell
why
the
pampas
and
elsewhere
there
are
bats
that
come
night
and
open
the
veins
cattle
and
horses
and
suck
dry
their
veins
how
some
islands
the
western
seas
there
are
bats
which
hang
the
trees
all
day
and
those
who
have
seen
describe
like
giant
nuts
pods
and
that
when
the
sailors
sleep
the
deck
because
that
hot
flit
down
them
and
then
and
then
the
morning
are
found
dead
men
white
even
miss
lucy
was
good
god
professor
said
starting
you
mean
tell
that
lucy
was
bitten
such
bat
and
that
such
thing
here
london
the
nineteenth
century
waved
his
hand
for
silence
and
went
can
you
tell
why
the
tortoise
lives
more
long
than
generations
men
why
the
elephant
goes
and
till
have
seen
dynasties
and
why
the
parrot
never
die
only
bite
cat
dog
other
complaint
can
you
tell
why
men
believe
all
ages
and
places
that
there
are
some
few
who
live
always
they
permit
that
there
are
men
and
women
who
cannot
die
all
know
because
science
has
vouched
for
the
fact
that
there
have
been
toads
shut
rocks
for
thousands
years
shut
one
small
hole
that
only
hold
him
since
the
youth
the
world
can
you
tell
how
the
indian
fakir
can
make
himself
die
and
have
been
buried
and
his
grave
sealed
and
corn
sowed
and
the
corn
reaped
and
cut
and
sown
and
reaped
and
cut
again
and
then
men
come
and
take
away
the
unbroken
seal
and
that
there
lie
the
indian
fakir
not
dead
but
that
rise
and
walk
amongst
them
before
here
interrupted
him
was
getting
bewildered
crowded
mind
his
list
nature
eccentricities
and
possible
impossibilities
that
imagination
was
getting
fired
had
dim
idea
that
was
teaching
some
lesson
long
ago
used
his
study
amsterdam
but
used
then
tell
the
thing
that
could
have
the
object
thought
mind
all
the
time
but
now
was
without
this
help
yet
wanted
follow
him
said
professor
let
your
pet
student
again
tell
the
thesis
that
may
apply
your
knowledge
you
present
going
mind
from
point
point
mad
man
and
not
sane
one
follows
idea
feel
like
novice
lumbering

defined
faith
that
faculty
which
enables
believe
things
which
know
untrue
for
one
follow
that
man
meant
that
shall
have
open
mind
and
not
let
little
bit
truth
check
the
rush
big
truth
like
small
rock
does
railway
truck
get
the
small
truth
first
good
keep
him
and
value
him
but
all
the
same
must
not
let
him
think
himself
all
the
truth
the
universe
then
you
want
not
let
some
previous
conviction
injure
the
receptivity
mind
with
regard
some
strange
matter
read
your
lesson
aright
you
are
favourite
pupil
still
worth
teach
you
now
that
you
are
willing
understand

have
taken
the
first

and
then
took

pocket
and
held
and
then
spend
the
night
you
and
the
churchyard
where
lucy
lies

the
key
that

from
the
coffin

give
arthur
heart
sank
within
for
felt
that
there
was
some
fearful
ordeal
before
could
nothing
however
plucked
what
heart
could
and
said
that
had
better
hasten
the
afternoon
was
passing
found
the
child
awake
had
had
sleep
and
taken
some
food
and
altogether
was
going
well
vincent
took
the
bandage
from
its
throat
and
showed
the
punctures
there
was
mistaking
the
similarity
those
which
had
been
lucy
throat
they
were
smaller
and
the
edges
looked
fresher
that
was
all
asked
vincent
what
attributed
them
and
replied
that
must
have
been
bite
some
animal
perhaps
rat
but
for
his
own
part
was
inclined
think
that
was
one
the
bats
which
are
numerous
the
northern
heights
london
out
many
harmless
ones
said
there
may
some
wild
specimen
from
the
south
more
malignant
species
some
sailor
may
have
brought
one
home
and
managed
escape
even
from
the
zoölogical
gardens
young
one
may
have
got
loose
one
bred
there
from
vampire
these
things
occur
you
know
only
ten
days
ago
wolf
got
out
and
was
believe
traced
this
direction
for
week
after
the
children
were
playing
nothing
but
red
riding
hood
the
heath
and
every
alley
the
place
until
this
bloofer
lady
scare
came
along
since
when
has
been
quite
gala
time
with
them
even
this
poor
little
mite
when
woke
day
asked
the
nurse
might
away
when
she
asked
him
why
wanted
said
wanted
play
with
the
bloofer
lady
hope
said
van
helsing
that
when
you
are
sending
the
child
home
you
will
caution
its
parents
keep
strict
watch
over
these
fancies
stray
are
most
dangerous
and
the
child
were
remain
out
another
night
would
probably
fatal
but
any
case
suppose
you
will
not
let
away
for
some
days
certainly
not
not
for
week
least
longer
the
wound
not
healed
our
visit
the
hospital
took
more
time
than
had
reckoned
and
the
sun
had
dipped
before
came
out
when
van
helsing
saw
how
dark
was
said
there
hurry
more
late
than
thought
come
let
seek
somewhere
that
may
eat
and
then
shall
our
way
dined
jack
straw
castle
along
with
little
crowd
bicyclists
and
others
who
were
genially
noisy
about
ten
clock
started
from
the
inn
was
then
very
dark
and
the
scattered
lamps
made
the
darkness
greater
when
were
once
outside
their
individual
radius
the
professor
had
evidently
noted
the
road
were
for
went
unhesitatingly
but
for
was
quite
mixup
locality
went
further
met
fewer
and
fewer
people
till
last
were
somewhat
surprised
when
met
even
the
patrol
horse
police
going
their
usual
suburban
round
last
reached
the
wall
the
churchyard
which
climbed
over
with
some
little
difficulty
for
was
very
dark
and
the
whole
place
seemed
strange
found
the
westenra
tomb
the
professor
took
the
key
opened
the
creaky
door
and
standing
back
politely
but
quite
unconsciously
motioned
precede
him
there
was
delicious
irony
the
offer
the
courtliness
giving
preference
such
ghastly
occasion
companion
followed
quickly
and
cautiously
drew
the
door
after
carefully
ascertaining
that
the
lock
was
falling
and
not
spring
one
the
latter
case
should
have
been
bad
plight
then
fumbled
his
bag
and
taking
out
matchbox
and
piece
candle
proceeded
make
light
the
tomb
the
day
time
and
when
wreathed
with
fresh
flowers
had
looked
grim
and
gruesome
enough
but
now
some
days
afterwards
when
the
flowers
hung
lank
and
dead
their
whites
turning
rust
and
their
greens
browns
when
the
spider
and
the
beetle
had
resumed
their
accustomed
dominance
when
time
discoloured
stone
and
dust
encrusted
mortar
and
rusty
dank
iron
and
tarnished
brass
and
clouded
silver
plating
gave
back
the
feeble
glimmer
candle
the
effect
was
more
miserable
and
sordid
than
could
have
been
imagined
conveyed
irresistibly
the
idea
that
life
animal
life
was
not
the
only
thing
which
could
pass
away
van
helsing
went
about
his
work
systematically
holding
his
candle
that
could
read
the
coffin
plates
and
holding
that
the
sperm
dropped
white
patches
which
congealed
they
touched
the
metal
made
assurance
lucy
coffin
another
search
his
bag
and
took
out
turnscrew
what
are
you
going
asked
open
the
coffin
you
shall
yet
convinced
straightway
began
taking
out
the
screws
and
finally
lifted
off
the
lid
showing
the
casing
lead
beneath
the
sight
was
almost
too
much
for
seemed
much
affront
the
dead
would
have
been
have
stripped
off
her
clothing
her
sleep
whilst
living
actually
took
hold
his
hand
stop
him
only
said
you
shall
see
and
again
fumbling
his
bag
took
out
tiny
fret
saw
striking
the
turnscrew
through
the
lead
with
swift
downward
stab
which
made
wince
made
small
hole
which
was
however
big
enough
admit
the
point
the
saw
had
expected
rush
gas
from
the
week
old
corpse
doctors
who
have
had
study
our
dangers
have
become
accustomed
such
things
and
drew
back
towards
the
door
but
the
professor
never
stopped
for
moment
sawed
down
couple
feet
along
one
side
the
lead
coffin
and
then
across
and
down
the
other
side
taking
the
edge
the
loose
flange
bent
back
towards
the
foot
the
coffin
and
holding
the
candle
into
the
aperture
motioned
look
drew
near
and
looked
the
coffin
was
empty
was
certainly
surprise
and
gave
considerable
shock
but
van
helsing
was
unmoved
was
now
more
sure
than
ever
his
ground
and
emboldened
proceed
his
task
are
you
satisfied
now
friend
john
asked
felt
all
the
dogged
argumentativeness
nature
awake
within
answered
him
satisfied
that
lucy
body
not
that
coffin
but
that
only
proves
one
thing
and
what
that
friend
john
that
not
there
that
good
logic
said
far
goes
but
how
you
how
can
you
account
for
not
being
there
perhaps
body
snatcher
suggested
some
the
undertaker
people
may
have
stolen
felt
that
was
speaking
folly
and
yet
was
the
only
real
cause
which
could
suggest
the
professor
sighed
well
said
must
have
more
proof
come
with
put
the
coffin
lid
again
gathered
all
his
things
and
placed
them
the
bag
blew
out
the
light
and
placed
the
candle
also
the
bag
opened
the
door
and
went
out
behind
closed
the
door
and
locked
handed
the
key
saying
will
you
keep
you
had
better
assured
laughed
was
not
very
cheerful
laugh
bound
say
motioned
him
keep
key
nothing
said
there
may
duplicates
and
anyhow
not
difficult
pick
lock
that
kind
said
nothing
but
put
the
key
his
pocket
then
told
watch
one
side
the
churchyard
whilst
would
watch
the
other
took
place
behind
yew
tree
and
saw
his
dark
figure
move
until
the
intervening
headstones
and
trees
hid
from
sight
was
lonely
vigil
just
after
had
taken
place
heard
distant
clock
strike
twelve
and
time
came
one
and
two
was
chilled
and
unnerved
and
angry
with
the
professor
for
taking
such
errand
and
with
myself
for
coming
was
too
cold
and
too
sleepy
keenly
observant
and
not
sleepy
enough
betray
trust
altogether
had
dreary
miserable
time
suddenly
turned
round
thought
saw
something
like
white
streak
moving
between
two
dark
yew
trees
the
side
the
churchyard
farthest
from
the
tomb
the
same
time
dark
mass
moved
from
the
professor
side
the
ground
and
hurriedly
went
towards
then
too
moved
but
had
round
headstones
and
railed
off
tombs
and
stumbled
over
graves
the
sky
was
overcast
and
somewhere
far
off
early
cock
crew
little
way
off
beyond
line
scattered
juniper
trees
which
marked
the
pathway
the
church
white
dim
figure
flitted
the
direction
the
tomb
the
tomb
itself
was
hidden
trees
and
could
not
see
where
the
figure
disappeared
heard
the
rustle
actual
movement
where
had
first
seen
the
white
figure
and
coming
over
found
the
professor
holding
his
arms
tiny
child
when
saw
held
out
and
said
are
you
satisfied
now
said
way
that
felt
was
aggressive
you
not
see
the
child
yes
child
but
who
brought
here
and
wounded
asked
shall
see
said
the
professor
and
with
one
impulse
took
our
way
out
the
churchyard
carrying
the
sleeping
child
when
had
got
some
little
distance
away
went
into
clump
trees
and
struck
match
and
looked
the
child
throat
was
without
scratch
scar
any
kind
was
right
asked
triumphantly
were
just
time
said
the
professor
thankfully
had
now
decide
what
were
with
the
child
and
consulted
about
were
take
police
station
should
have
give
some
account
our
movements
during
the
night
least
should
have
had
make
some
statement
how
had
come
find
the
child
finally
decided
that
would
take
the
heath
and
when
heard
policeman
coming
would
leave
where
could
not
fail
find
would
then
seek
our
way
home
quickly
could
all
fell
out
well
the
edge
hampstead
heath
heard
policeman
heavy
tramp
and
laying
the
child
the
pathway
waited
and
watched
until
saw
flashed
his
lantern
and
fro
heard
his
exclamation
astonishment
and
then
went
away
silently
good
chance
got
cab
near
the
spaniards
and
drove
town
cannot
sleep
make
this
entry
but
must
try
get
few
hours
sleep
van
helsing
call
for
noon
insists
that
shall
with
him
another
expedition
september
was
two
clock
before
found
suitable
opportunity
for
our
attempt
the
funeral
held
noon
was
all
completed
and
the
last
stragglers
the
mourners
had
taken
themselves
lazily
away
when
looking
carefully
from
behind
clump
alder
trees
saw
the
sexton
lock
the
gate
after
him
knew
then
that
were
safe
till
morning
did
desire
but
the
professor
told
that
should
not
want
more
than
hour
most
again
felt
that
horrid
sense
the
reality
things
which
any
effort
imagination
seemed
out
place
and
realised
distinctly
the
perils
the
law
which
were
incurring
our
unhallowed
work
besides
felt
was
all
useless
outrageous
was
open
leaden
coffin
see
woman
dead
nearly
week
were
really
dead
now
seemed
the
height
folly
open
the
tomb
again
when
knew
from
the
evidence
our
own
eyesight
that
the
coffin
was
empty
shrugged
shoulders
however
and
rested
silent
for
van
helsing
had
way
going
his
own
road
matter
who
remonstrated
took
the
key
opened
the
vault
and
again
courteously
motioned
precede
the
place
was
not
gruesome
last
night
but
how
unutterably
mean
looking
when
the
sunshine
streamed
van
helsing
walked
over
lucy
coffin
and
followed
bent
over
and
again
forced
back
the
leaden
flange
and
then
shock
surprise
and
dismay
shot
through
there
lay
lucy
seemingly
just
had
seen
her
the
night
before
her
funeral
she
was
possible
more
radiantly
beautiful
than
ever
and
could
not
believe
that
she
was
dead
the
lips
were
red
nay
redder
than
before
and
the
cheeks
was
delicate
bloom
this
juggle
said
him
are
you
convinced
now
said
the
professor
response
and
spoke
put
over
his
hand
and
way
that
made
shudder
pulled
back
the
dead
lips
and
showed
the
white
teeth
see
went
see
they
are
even
sharper
than
before
with
this
and
this
and
touched
one
the
canine
teeth
and
that
below
the
little
children
can
bitten
are
you
belief
now
friend
john
once
more
argumentative
hostility
woke
within
could
not
accept
such
overwhelming
idea
suggested
with
attempt
argue
which
was
even
the
moment
ashamed
said
she
may
have
been
placed
here
since
last
night
indeed
that
and
whom
not
know
some
one
has
done
and
yet
she
has
been
dead
one
week
most
peoples
that
time
would
not
look
had
answer
for
this
was
silent
van
helsing
did
not
seem
notice
silence
any
rate
showed
neither
chagrin
nor
triumph
was
looking
intently
the
face
the
dead
woman
raising
the
eyelids
and
looking
the
eyes
and
once
more
opening
the
lips
and
examining
the
teeth
then
turned
and
said
here
there
one
thing
which
different
from
all
recorded
here
some
dual
life
that
not
the
common
she
was
bitten
the
vampire
when
she
was
trance
sleep
walking
you
start
you
not
know
that
friend
john
but
you
shall
know
all
later
and
trance
could
best
come
take
more
blood
trance
she
died
and
trance
she
dead
too
that
she
differ
from
all
other
usually
when
the
dead
sleep
home
spoke
made
comprehensive
sweep
his
arm
designate
what
vampire
was
home
their
face
show
what
they
are
but
this
sweet
that
was
when
she
not
dead
she
back
the
nothings
the
common
dead
there
malign
there
see
and
make
hard
that
must
kill
her
her
sleep
this
turned
blood
cold
and
began
dawn
upon
that
was
accepting
van
helsing
theories
but
she
were
really
dead
what
was
there
terror
the
idea
killing
her
looked
and
evidently
saw
the
change
face
for
said
almost
joyously
you
believe
now
answered
not
press
too
hard
all
once
willing
accept
how
will
you
this
bloody
work
shall
cut
off
her
head
and
fill
her
mouth
with
garlic
and
shall
drive
stake
through
her
body
made
shudder
think
mutilating
the
body
the
woman
whom
had
loved
and
yet
the
feeling
was
not
strong
had
expected
was
fact
beginning
shudder
the
presence
this
being
this
dead
van
helsing
called
and
loathe
possible
that
love
all
subjective
all
objective
waited
considerable
time
for
van
helsing
begin
but
stood
wrapped
thought
presently
closed
the
catch
his
bag
with
snap
and
said
have
been
thinking
and
have
made
mind
what
best
did
simply
follow
inclining
would
now
this
moment
what
done
but
there
are
other
things
follow
and
things
that
are
thousand
times
more
difficult
that
them
not
know
this
simple
she
have
yet
life
taken
though
that
time
and
act
now
would
take
danger
from
her
for
ever
but
then
may
have
want
arthur
and
how
shall
tell
him
this
you
who
saw
the
wounds
lucy
throat
and
saw
the
wounds
similar
the
child
the
hospital
you
who
saw
the
coffin
empty
last
night
and
full
day
with
woman
who
have
not
change
only
more
rose
and
more
beautiful
whole
week
after
she
die
you
know
this
and
know
the
white
figure
last
night
that
brought
the
child
the
churchyard
and
yet
your
own
senses
you
did
not
believe
how
then
can
expect
arthur
who
know
none
those
things
believe
doubted
when
took
him
from
her
kiss
when
she
was
dying
know
has
forgiven
because
some
mistaken
idea
have
done
things
that
prevent
him
say
good
bye
ought
and
may
think
that
some
more
mistaken
idea
this
woman
was
buried
alive
and
that
most
mistake
all
have
killed
her
will
then
argue
back
that
mistaken
ones
that
have
killed
her
our
ideas
and
will
much
unhappy
always
yet
never
can
sure
and
that
the
worst
all
and
will
sometimes
think
that
she
loved
was
buried
alive
and
that
will
paint
his
dreams
with
horrors
what
she
must
have
suffered
and
again
will
think
that
may
right
and
that
his
beloved
was
after
all
dead

him
once
and
since
then

thousand
times

bitter
waters

wonderful
what
good
night
sleep
will
for
one
yesterday
was
almost
willing
accept
van
helsing
monstrous
ideas
but
now
they
seem
start
out
lurid
before
outrages
common
sense
have
doubt
that
believes
all
wonder
his
mind
can
have
become
any
way
unhinged
surely
there
must
some
rational
explanation
all
these
mysterious
things
possible
that
the
professor
can
have
done
himself
abnormally
clever
that
went
off
his
head
would
carry
out
his
intent
with
regard
some
fixed
idea
wonderful
way
loath
think
and
indeed
would
almost
great
marvel
the
other
find
that
van
helsing
was
mad
but
anyhow
shall
watch
him
carefully
may
get
some
light
the
mystery
september
morning
last
night
little
before
ten
clock
arthur
and
quincey
came
into
van
helsing
room
told
all
that
wanted
but
especially
addressing
himself
arthur
all
our
wills
were
centred
his
began
saying
that
hoped
would
all
come
with
him
too
for
said
there
grave
duty
done
there
you
were
doubtless
surprised
letter
this
query
was
directly
addressed
lord
godalming
was
rather
upset
for
bit
there
has
been
much
trouble
around
house
late
that
could
without
any
more
have
been
curious
too
what
you
mean
quincey
and
talked
over
but
the
more
talked
the
more
puzzled
got
till
now
can
say
for
myself
that
about
tree
any
meaning
about
anything
too
said
quincey
morris
laconically
said
the
professor
then
you
are
nearer
the
beginning
both
you
than
friend
john
here
who
has
long
way
back
before
can
even
get
far
begin
was
evident
that
recognised
return
old
doubting
frame
mind
without
saying
word
then
turning
the
other
two
said
with
intense
gravity
want
your
permission
what
think
good
this
night
know
much
ask
and
when
you
know
what
propose
you
will
know
and
only
then
how
much
therefore
may
ask
that
you
promise
the
dark
that
afterwards
though
you
may
angry
with
for
time
must
not
disguise
from
myself
the
possibility
that
such
may
you
shall
not
blame
yourselves
for
anything
that
frank
anyhow
broke
quincey
answer
for
the
professor
don
quite
see
his
drift
but
swear
honest
and
that
good
enough
for
thank
you
sir
said
van
helsing
proudly
have
done
myself
the
honour
counting
you
one
trusting
friend
and
such
endorsement
dear
held
out
hand
which
quincey
took
then
arthur
spoke
out
van
helsing
don
quite
like
buy
pig
poke
they
say
scotland
and
anything
which
honour
gentleman
faith
christian
concerned
cannot
make
such
promise
you
can
assure
that
what
you
intend
does
not
violate
either
these
two
then
give
consent
once
though
for
the
life
cannot
understand
what
you
are
driving
accept
your
limitation
said
van
helsing
and
all
ask
you
that
you
feel
necessary
condemn
any
act
mine
you
will
first
consider
well
and
satisfied
that
does
not
violate
your
reservations
agreed
said
arthur
that
only
fair
and
now
that
the
pourparlers
are
over
may
ask
what
are

you
come
with
and
come

arthur
face
fell
said
amazed
sort
way
where
poor
lucy
buried
the
professor
bowed
arthur
went
and
when
there
enter
the
tomb
arthur
stood
professor
are
you
earnest
some
monstrous
joke
pardon
see
that
you
are
earnest
sat
down
again
but
could
see
that
sat
firmly
and
proudly
one
who
his
dignity
there
was
silence
until
asked
again
and
when
the
tomb
open
the
coffin
this
too
much
said
angrily
rising
again
willing
patient
all
things
that
are
reasonable
but
this
this
desecration
the
grave
one
who
fairly
choked
with
indignation
the
professor
looked
pityingly
him
could
spare
you
one
pang
poor
friend
said
god
knows
would
but
this
night
our
feet
must
tread
thorny
paths
later
and
for
ever
the
feet
you
love
must
walk
paths
flame
arthur
looked
with
set
white
face
and
said
take
care
sir
take
care
would
not
well
hear
what
have
say
said
van
helsing
and
then
you
will
least
know
the
limit
purpose
shall
that
fair
enough
broke
morris
after
pause
van
helsing
went
evidently
with
effort
miss
lucy
dead
not
yes
then
there
can
wrong
her
but
she
not
dead
arthur
jumped
his
feet
good
god
cried
what
you
mean
has
there
been
any
mistake
has
she
been
buried
alive
groaned
anguish
that
not
even

could
soften
did
not
say
she
was
alive
child
did
not
think
further
than
say
that
she
might

what
you
mean
this
all
nightmare
what
there
are
mysteries
which
men

van
helsing
rose
from
where
had
all
the

been

and
said
gravely
and
sternly
lord

god
shall
all
ask
you
now
that

when
later
make

broke
little
and
went
with
voice
full
pity
but
beseech
you
not
forth
anger
with
long
life
acts
which
were
often
not
pleasant
and
which
sometimes
did
wring
heart

never
had
heavy
task
now
believe
that
the
time
comes
for
you
change
your
mind
towards
one
look
from
you
will
wipe
away
all
this
sad
hour
for

what

came

for
her
ashamed
say
much
but
say
kindness
gave
what
you
gave
the
blood

gave
who
was
not

only
her
physician
and

death
can
her
good
even
now
when
she
the

dead

said
this
with
very
grave
sweet
pride

arthur
was
much
affected

with
you

chapter

seward
diary
continued
was
just
quarter
before
twelve
clock
when
got
into
the
churchyard
over
the
low
wall
the
night
was
dark
with
occasional
gleams
moonlight
between
the
rents
the
heavy
clouds
that
scudded
across
the
sky
all
kept
somehow
close
together
with
van
helsing
slightly
front
led
the
way
when
had
come
close
the
tomb
looked
well
arthur
for
feared
that
the
proximity
place
laden
with
sorrowful
memory
would
upset
him
but
bore
himself
well
took
that
the
very
mystery
the
proceeding
was
some
way
counteractant
his
grief
the
professor
unlocked
the
door
and
seeing
natural
hesitation
amongst
for
various
reasons
solved
the
difficulty
entering
first
himself
the
rest
followed
and
closed
the
door
then
lit
dark
lantern
and
pointed
the
coffin
arthur
stepped
forward
hesitatingly
van
helsing
said
you
were
with
here
yesterday
was
the
body
miss
lucy
that
coffin
was
the
professor
turned
the
rest
saying
you
hear
and
yet
there
one
who
does
not
believe
with
took
his
screwdriver
and
again
took
off
the
lid
the
coffin
arthur
looked
very
pale
but
silent
when
the
lid
was
removed
stepped
forward
evidently
did
not
know
that
there
was
leaden
coffin
any
rate
had
not
thought
when
saw
the
rent
the
lead
the
blood
rushed
his
face
for
instant
but
quickly
fell
away
again
that
remained
ghastly
whiteness
was
still
silent
van
helsing
forced
back
the
leaden
flange
and
all
looked
and
recoiled
the
coffin
was
empty
for
several
minutes
one
spoke
word
the
silence
was
broken
quincey
morris
professor
answered
for
you
your
word
all
want
wouldn
ask
such
thing
ordinarily
wouldn
dishonour
you
imply
doubt
but
this
mystery
that
goes
beyond
any
honour
dishonour
this
your
doing
swear
you
all
that
hold
sacred
that
have
not
removed
nor
touched
her
what
happened
was
this
two
nights
ago
friend
seward
and
came
here
with
good
purpose
believe
opened
that
coffin
which
was
then
sealed
and
found
now
empty
then
waited
and
saw
something
white
come
through
the
trees
the
next
day
came
here
day
time
and
she
lay
there
did
she
not
friend
john
yes
that
night
were
just
time
one
more
small
child
was
missing
and
find
thank
god
unharmed
amongst
the
graves
yesterday
came
here
before
sundown
for
sundown
the
dead
can
move
waited
here
all
the
night
till
the
sun
rose
but
saw
nothing
was
most
probable
that
was
because
had
laid
over
the
clamps
those
doors
garlic
which
the
dead
cannot
bear
and
other
things
which
they
shun
last
night
there
was
exodus
night
before
the
sundown
took
away
garlic
and
other
things
and
find
this
coffin
empty
but
bear
with
far
there
much
that
strange
wait
you
with
outside
unseen
and
unheard
and
things
much
stranger
are
yet
here
shut
the
dark
slide
his
lantern
now
the
outside
opened
the
door
and
filed
out
coming
last
and
locking
the
door
behind
him
but
seemed
fresh
and
pure
the
night
air
after
the
terror
that
vault
how
sweet
was
see
the
clouds
race
and
the
passing
gleams
the
moonlight
between
the
scudding
clouds
crossing
and
passing
like
the
gladness
and
sorrow
man
life
how
sweet
was
breathe
the
fresh
air
that
had
taint
death
and
decay
how
humanising
see
the
red
lighting
the
sky
beyond
the
hill
and
hear
far
away
the
muffled
roar
that
marks
the
life
great
city
each
his
own
way
was
solemn
and
overcome
arthur
was
silent
and
was
could
see
striving
grasp
the
purpose
and
the
inner
meaning
the
mystery
was
myself
tolerably
patient
and
half
inclined
again
throw
aside
doubt
and
accept
van
helsing
conclusions
quincey
morris
was
phlegmatic
the
way
man
who
accepts
all
things
and
accepts
them
the
spirit
cool
bravery
with
hazard
all
has
stake
not
being
able
smoke
cut
himself
good
sized
plug
tobacco
and
began
chew
van
helsing
was
employed
definite
way
first
took
from
his
bag
mass
what
looked
like
thin
wafer
like
biscuit
which
was
carefully
rolled
white
napkin
next
took
out
double
handful
some
whitish
stuff
like
dough
putty
crumbled
the
wafer
fine
and
worked
into
the
mass
between
his
hands
this
then
took
and
rolling
into
thin
strips
began
lay
them
into
the
crevices
between
the
door
and
its
setting
the
tomb
was
somewhat
puzzled
this
and
being
close
asked
him
what
was
that
was
doing
arthur
and
quincey
drew
near
also
they
too
were
curious
answered
closing
the
tomb
that
the
dead
may
not
enter
and
that
stuff
you
have
put
there
going
asked
quincey
great
scott
this
game
what
that
which
you
are
using
this
time
the
question
was
arthur
van
helsing
reverently
lifted
his
hat
answered
the
host
brought
from
amsterdam
have
indulgence
was
answer
that
appalled
the
most
sceptical
and
felt
individually
that
the
presence
such
earnest
purpose
the
professor
purpose
which
could
thus
use
the
him
most
sacred
things
was
impossible
distrust
respectful
silence
took
the
places
assigned
close
round
the
tomb
but
hidden
from
the
sight
any
one
approaching
pitied
the
others
especially
arthur
had
myself
been
apprenticed
former
visits
this
watching
horror
and
yet
who
had
hour
ago
repudiated
the
proofs
felt
heart
sink
within
never
did
tombs
look
ghastly
white
never
did
cypress
yew
juniper
seem
the
embodiment
funereal
gloom
never
did
tree
grass
wave
rustle
ominously
never
did
bough
creak
mysteriously
and
never
did
the
far
away
howling
dogs
send
such
woeful
presage
through
the
night
there
was
long
spell
silence
big
aching
void
and
then
from
the
professor
keen
pointed
and
far
down
the
avenue
yews
saw
white
figure
advance
dim
white
figure
which
held
something
dark
its
breast
the
figure
stopped
and
the
moment
ray
moonlight
fell
upon
the
masses
driving
clouds
and
showed
startling
prominence
dark
haired
woman
dressed
the
cerements
the
grave
could
not
see
the
face
for
was
bent
down
over
what
saw
fair
haired
child
there
was
pause
and
sharp
little
cry
such
child
gives
sleep
dog
lies
before
the
fire
and
dreams
were
starting
forward
but
the
professor
warning
hand
seen
stood
behind
yew
tree
kept
back
and
then
looked
the
white
figure
moved
forwards
again
was
now
near
enough
for
see
clearly
and
the
moonlight
still
held
own
heart
grew
cold
ice
and
could
hear
the
gasp
arthur
recognised
the
features
lucy
westenra
lucy
westenra
but
yet
how
changed
the
sweetness
was
turned
adamantine
heartless
cruelty
and
the
purity
voluptuous
wantonness
van
helsing
stepped
out
and
obedient
his
gesture
all
advanced
too
the
four
ranged
line
before
the
door
the
tomb
van
helsing
raised
his
lantern
and
drew
the
slide
the
concentrated
light
that
fell
lucy
face
could
see
that
the
lips
were
crimson
with
fresh
blood
and
that
the
stream
had
trickled
over
her
chin
and
stained
the
purity
her
lawn
death
robe
shuddered
with
horror
could
see
the
tremulous
light
that
even
van
helsing
iron
nerve
had
failed
arthur
was
next
and
had
not
seized
his
arm
and
held
him
would
have
fallen
when
lucy
call
the
thing
that
was
before
lucy
because
bore
her
shape
saw
she
drew
back
with
angry
snarl
such
cat
gives
when
taken
unawares
then
her
eyes
ranged
over
lucy
eyes
form
and
colour
but
lucy
eyes
unclean
and
full
hell
fire
instead
the
pure
gentle
orbs
knew
that
moment
the
remnant
love
passed
into
hate
and
loathing
had
she
then
killed
could
have
done
with
savage
delight
she
looked
her
eyes
blazed
with
unholy
light
and
the
face
became
wreathed
with
voluptuous
smile
god
how
made
shudder
see
with
careless
motion
she
flung
the
ground
callous
devil
the
child
that
now
she
had
clutched
strenuously
her
breast
growling
over
dog
growls
over
bone
the
child
gave
sharp
cry
and
lay
there
moaning
there
was
cold
bloodedness
the
act
which
wrung
groan
from
arthur
when
she
advanced
him
with
outstretched
arms
and
wanton
smile
fell
back
and
hid
his
face
his
hands
she
still
advanced
however
and
with
languorous
voluptuous
grace
said
come
arthur
leave
these
others
and
come
arms
are
hungry
for
you
come
and
can
rest
together
come
husband
come
there
was
something
diabolically
sweet
her
tones
something
the
tingling
glass
when
struck
which
rang
through
the
brains
even
who
heard
the
words
addressed
another
for
arthur
seemed
under
spell
moving
his
hands
from
his
face
opened
wide
his
arms
she
was
leaping
for
them
when
van
helsing
sprang
forward
and
held
between
them
his
little
golden
crucifix
she
recoiled
from
and
with
suddenly
distorted
face
full
rage
dashed
past
him
enter
the
tomb
when
within
foot
two
the
door
however
she
stopped
arrested
some
irresistible
force
then
she
turned
and
her
face
was
shown
the
clear
burst
moonlight
and
the
lamp
which
had
now
quiver
from
van
helsing
iron
nerves
never
did
see
such
baffled
malice
face
and
never
trust
shall
such
ever
seen
again
mortal
eyes
the
beautiful
colour
became
livid
the
eyes
seemed
throw
out
sparks
hell
fire
the
brows
were
wrinkled
though
the
folds
the
flesh
were
the
coils
medusa
snakes
and
the
lovely
blood
stained
mouth
grew
open
square
the
passion
masks
the
greeks
and
japanese
ever
face
meant
death
looks
could
kill
saw
that
moment
and
for
full
half
minute
which
seemed
eternity
she
remained
between
the
lifted
crucifix
and
the
sacred
closing
her
means
entry
van
helsing
broke
the
silence
asking
arthur
answer
friend
proceed
work
arthur
threw
himself
his
knees
and
hid
his
face
his
hands
answered
you
will
friend
you
will
there
can
horror
like
this
ever
any
more
and
groaned
spirit
quincey
and
simultaneously
moved
towards
him
and
took
his
arms
could
hear
the
click
the
closing
lantern
van
helsing
held
down
coming
close
the
tomb
began
remove
from
the
chinks
some
the
sacred
emblem
which
had
placed
there
all
looked
horrified
amazement
saw
when
stood
back
the
woman
with
corporeal
body
real
that
moment
our
own
pass
through
the
interstice
where
scarce
knife
blade
could
have
gone
all
felt
glad
sense
relief
when
saw
the
professor
calmly
restoring
the
strings
putty
the
edges
the
door
when
this
was
done
lifted
the
child
and
said
come
now
friends
can
more
till
morrow
there
funeral
noon
here
shall
all
come
before
long
after
that
the
friends
the
dead
will
all
gone
two
and
when
the
sexton
lock
the
gate
shall
remain
then
there
more
but
not
like
this
night
for
this
little
one
not
much
harm
and
morrow
night
shall
well
shall
leave
him
where
the
police
will
find
him
the
other
night
and
then
home
coming
close
arthur
said
friend
arthur
you
have
had
sore
trial
but
after
when
you
look
back
you
will
see
how
was
necessary
you
are
now
the
bitter
waters
child
this
time
morrow
you
will
please
god
have
passed
them
and
have
drunk
the
sweet
waters
not
mourn
overmuch
till
then
shall
not
ask
you
forgive
arthur
and
quincey
came
home
with
and
tried
cheer
each
other
the
way
had
left
the
child
safety
and
were
tired
all
slept
with
more
less
reality
sleep
september
night
little
before
twelve
clock
three
arthur
quincey
morris
and
myself
called
for
the
professor
was
odd
notice
that
common
consent
had
all
put
black
clothes
course
arthur
wore
black
for
was
deep
mourning
but
the
rest
wore
instinct
got
the
churchyard
half
past
one
and
strolled
about
keeping
out
official
observation
that
when
the
gravediggers
had
completed
their
task
and
the
sexton
under
the
belief
that
every
one
had
gone
had
locked
the
gate
had
the
place
all
ourselves
van
helsing
instead
his
little
black
bag
had
with
him
long
leather
one
something
like
cricketing
bag
was
manifestly
fair
weight
when
were
alone
and
had
heard
the
last
the
footsteps
die
out
the
road
silently
and
ordered
intention
followed
the
professor
the
tomb
unlocked
the
door
and
entered
closing
behind
then
took
from
his
bag
the
lantern
which
lit
and
also
two
wax
candles
which
when
lighted
stuck
melting
their
own
ends
other
coffins
that
they
might
give
light
sufficient
work
when
again
lifted
the
lid
off
lucy
coffin
all
looked
arthur
trembling
like
aspen
and
saw
that
the
body
lay
there
all
its
death
beauty
but
there
was
love
own
heart
nothing
but
loathing
for
the
foul
thing
which
had
taken
lucy
shape
without
her
soul
could
see
even
arthur
face
grow
hard
looked
presently
said
van
helsing
this
really
lucy
body
only
demon
her
shape
her
body
and
yet
not
but
wait
while
and
you
all
see
her
she
was
and
she
seemed
like
nightmare
lucy
she
lay
there
the
pointed
teeth
the
bloodstained
voluptuous
mouth
which
made
one
shudder
see
the
whole
carnal
and
unspiritual
appearance
seeming
like
devilish
mockery
lucy
sweet
purity
van
helsing
with
his
usual
methodicalness
began
taking
the
various
contents
from
his
bag
and
placing
them
ready
for
use
first
took
out
soldering
iron
and
some
plumbing
solder
and
then
small
oil
lamp
which
gave
out
when
lit
corner
the
tomb
gas
which
burned
fierce
heat
with
blue
flame
then
his
operating
knives
which
placed
hand
and
last
round
wooden
stake
some
two
and
half
three
inches
thick
and
about
three
feet
long
one
end
was
hardened
charring
the
fire
and
was
sharpened
fine
point
with
this
stake
came
heavy
hammer
such
households
used
the
coal
cellar
for
breaking
the
lumps
doctor
preparations
for
work
any
kind
are
stimulating
and
bracing
but
the
effect
these
things
both
arthur
and
quincey
was
cause
them
sort
consternation
they
both
however
kept
their
courage
and
remained
silent
and
quiet
when
all
was
ready
van
helsing
said
before
anything
let
tell
you
this
out
the
lore
and
experience
the
ancients
and
all
those
who
have
studied
the
powers
the
dead
when
they
become
such
there
comes
with
the
change
the
curse
immortality
they
cannot
die
but
must
age
after
age
adding
new
victims
and
multiplying
the
evils
the
world
for
all
that
die
from
the
preying
the
dead
becomes
themselves
dead
and
prey
their
kind
and
the
circle
goes
ever
widening
like
the
ripples
from
stone
thrown
the
water
friend
arthur
you
had
met
that
kiss
which
you
know
before
poor
lucy
die
again
last
night
when
you
open
your
arms
her
you
would
time
when
you
had
died
have
become
nosferatu
they
call
eastern
europe
and
would
all
time
make
more
those
deads
that
have
fill
with
horror
the
career
this
unhappy
dear
lady
but
just
begun
those
children
whose
blood
she
suck
are
not
yet
much
the
worse
but
she
live
dead
more
and
more
they
lose
their
blood
and
her
power
over
them
they
come
her
and
she
draw
their
blood
with
that
wicked
mouth
but
she
die
truth
then
all
cease
the
tiny
wounds
the
throats
disappear
and
they
back
their
plays
unknowing
ever
what
has
been
but
the
most
blessed
all
when
this
now
dead
made
rest
true
dead
then
the
soul
the
poor
lady
whom
love
shall
again
free
instead
working
wickedness
night
and
growing
more
debased
the
assimilating
day
she
shall
take
her
place
with
the
other
angels
that
friend
will
blessed
hand
for
her
that
shall
strike
the
blow
that
sets
her
free
this
willing
but
there
none
amongst
who
has
better
right
will
joy
think
hereafter
the
silence
the
night
when
sleep
not
was
hand
that
sent
her
the
stars
was
the
hand
him
that
loved
her
best
the
hand
that
all
she
would
herself
have
chosen
had
been
her
choose
tell
there
such
one
amongst
all
looked
arthur
saw
too
what
all
did
the
infinite
kindness
which
suggested
that
his
should
the
hand
which
would
restore
lucy
holy
and
not
unholy
memory
stepped
forward
and
said
bravely
though
his
hand
trembled
and
his
face
was
pale
snow
true
friend
from
the
bottom
broken
heart
thank
you
tell
what
and
shall
not
falter
van
helsing
laid
hand
his
shoulder
and
said
brave
lad
moment
courage
and
done
this
stake
must
driven
through
her
will
fearful
ordeal
not
deceived
that
but
will
only
short
time
and
you
will
then
rejoice
more
than
your
pain
was
great
from
this
grim
tomb
you
will
emerge
though
you
tread
air
but
you
must
not
falter
when
once
you
have
begun
only
think
that
your
true
friends
are
round
you
and
that
pray
for
you
all
the
time
said
arthur
hoarsely
tell
what
take
this
stake
your
left
hand
ready
place
the
point
over
the
heart
and
the
hammer
your
right
then
when
begin
our
prayer
for
the
dead
shall
read
him
have
here
the
book
and
the
others
shall
follow
strike
god
name
that
all
may
well
with
the
dead
that
love
and
that
the
dead
pass
away
arthur
took
the
stake
and
the
hammer
and
when
once
his
mind
was
set
action
his
hands
never
trembled
nor
even
quivered
van
helsing
opened
his
missal
and
began
read
and
quincey
and
followed
well
could
arthur
placed
the
point
over
the
heart
and
looked
could
see
its
dint
the
white
flesh
then
struck
with
all
his
might
the
thing
the
coffin
writhed
and
hideous
blood
curdling
screech
came
from
the
opened
red
lips
the
body
shook
and
quivered
and
twisted
wild
contortions
the
sharp
white
teeth
champed
together
till
the
lips
were
cut
and
the
mouth
was
smeared
with
crimson
foam
but
arthur
never
faltered
looked
like
figure
thor
his
untrembling
arm
rose
and
fell
driving
deeper
and
deeper
the
mercy
bearing
stake
whilst
the
blood
from
the
pierced
heart
welled
and
spurted
around
his
face
was
set
and
high
duty
seemed
shine
through
the
sight
gave
courage
that
our
voices
seemed
ring
through
the
little
vault
and
then
the
writhing
and
quivering
the
body
became
less
and
the
teeth
seemed
champ
and
the
face
quiver
finally
lay
still
the
terrible
task
was
over
the
hammer
fell
from
arthur
hand
reeled
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
caught
him
the
great
drops
sweat
sprang
from
his
forehead
and
his
breath
came
broken
gasps
had
indeed
been
awful
strain
him
and
had
not
been
forced
his
task
more
than
human
considerations
could
never
have
gone
through
with
for
few
minutes
were
taken
with
him
that
did
not
look
towards
the
coffin
when
did
however
murmur
startled
surprise
ran
from
one
the
other
gazed
eagerly
that
arthur
rose
for
had
been
seated
the
ground
and
came
and
looked
too
and
then
glad
strange
light
broke
over
his
face
and
dispelled
altogether
the
gloom
horror
that
lay
upon
there
the
coffin
lay
longer
the
foul
thing
that
had
dreaded
and
grown
hate
that
the
work
her
destruction
was
yielded
privilege
the
one
best
entitled
but
lucy
had
seen
her
her
life
with
her
face
unequalled
sweetness
and
purity
true
that
there
were
there
had
seen
them
life
the
traces
care
and
pain
and
waste
but
these
were
all
dear
for
they
marked
her
truth
what
knew
one
and
all
felt
that
the
holy
calm
that
lay
like
sunshine
over
the
wasted
face
and
form
was
only
earthly
token
and
symbol
the
calm
that
was
reign
for
ever
van
helsing
came
and
laid
his
hand
arthur
shoulder
and
said
him
and
now
arthur
friend
dear
lad
not
forgiven
the
reaction
the
terrible
strain
came
took
the
old
man
hand
his
and
raising
his
lips
pressed
and
said
forgiven
god
bless
you
that
you
have
given
dear
one
her
soul
again
and
peace
put
his
hands
the
professor
shoulder
and
laying
his
head
his
breast
cried
for
while
silently
whilst
stood
unmoving
when
raised
his
head
van
helsing
said
him
and
now
child
you
may
kiss
her
kiss
her
dead
lips
you
will
she
would
have
you
for
her
choose

the
devil

him
and
quincey
out

professor
and
sawed
the
top
off
the
stake
leaving
the
point

body
then
cut
off
the
head
and
filled
the
mouth
with
garlic
soldered
the
leaden
coffin
screwed
the
coffin
lid
and
gathering
our
belongings
came
away
when
the
professor
locked
the
door
gave
the
key
arthur
outside
the
air
was
sweet
the
sun
shone
and
the
birds
sang
and
seemed
all
nature
were
tuned
different
pitch
there
was
gladness
and
mirth
and
peace
everywhere
for
were
rest
ourselves

account
and
were
glad
though
was
with
tempered
joy
before
moved

entered
intense
surprise
there

the

opposite
him
was
what

from
the
description

was
much
interested

blurted
out
why

beats
even
shorthand

something
certainly
replied
with
alacrity
and
stood
put
train
for
speaking
then
paused
and
troubled
look
overspread
his
face
the
fact
began
awkwardly
only
keep
diary
and
entirely
almost
entirely
about
cases
may
awkward
that
mean
stopped
and
tried
help
him
out
his
embarrassment

some
grave
terrible
feeling

coming
over
again
paused
and
could
see
that
was
trying
invent
excuse
length
stammered
out
you
see
not
know
how
pick
out
any
particular
part
the
diary
even
while
was
speaking
idea
dawned
upon
him
and
said
with
unconscious
simplicity
different
voice
and
with
the
naivete
child
that
quite
true
upon
honour
honest
indian
could
not
but
smile
which
grimaced
gave
myself
away
that
time
said
but
you

that
although
have
kept
the
diary
for
months
past
never
once
struck
how
was
going
find
any
particular
part

time
mind
was
made
that
the
diary

they
lit
great
batch
typewriting
the
table
his
eyes
caught
the
look

seward
diary
september
was
absorbed
that
wonderful
diary
jonathan
harker
and
that
other
his
wife
that
let
the
time
run
without
thinking
mrs
harker
was
not
down
when
the
maid
came
announce
dinner
said
she
possibly
tired
let
dinner
wait
hour
and
went
with
work
had
just
finished
mrs
harker
diary
when
she
came
she
looked
sweetly
pretty
but
very
sad
and
her
eyes
were
flushed
with
crying
this
somehow
moved
much
late
have
had
cause
for
tears
god
knows
but
the
relief
them
was
denied
and
now
the
sight
those
sweet
eyes
brightened
with
recent
tears
went
straight
heart
said
gently
could
greatly
fear
have
distressed
you
not
distressed
she
replied
but
have
been
more
touched
than
can
say
your
grief
that
wonderful
machine
but
cruelly
true
told
its
very
tones
the
anguish
your
heart
was
like
soul
crying
out
almighty
god
one
must
hear
them
spoken
ever
again
see
have
tried
useful
have
copied
out
the
words
typewriter
and
none
other
need
now
hear
your
heart
beat
did
one
need
ever
know
shall
ever
know
said
low
voice
she
laid
her
hand
mine
and
said
very
gravely
but
they
must
must
but
why
asked
because
part
the
terrible
story
part
poor
dear
lucy
death
and
all
that
led
because
the
struggle
which
have
before
rid
the
earth
this
terrible
monster
must
have
all
the
knowledge
and
all
the
help
which
can
get
think
that
the
cylinders
which
you
gave
contained
more
than

but
can
see
that
there
are
your
record
many
lights

dark
mystery
you
will
let
help
will
you
not
know
all
certain

how
her
terrible
doom
was
being
wrought

have
secrets
amongst
working
together
and
with
absolute
trust
can
surely
stronger
than
some
were
the
dark
she
looked
appealingly
and
the
same
time
manifested
such
courage
and
resolution
her
bearing
that
gave
once
her
wishes
you
shall
said
you
like
the

terrible
things

but
you
have
far
travelled
the
road
poor

not
content

though

september
after
dinner
came
with
seward
his
study
brought
back
the
phonograph
from
room
and
took
typewriter
placed
comfortable
chair
and
arranged
the
phonograph
that
could
touch
without
getting
and
showed
how
stop
case
should
want
pause
then
very
thoughtfully
took
chair
with
his
back
that
might
free
possible
and
began
read
put
the
forked
metal
ears
and
listened
when
the
terrible
story
lucy
death
and
and
all
that
followed
was
done
lay
back
chair
powerless
fortunately
not
fainting
disposition
when
seward
saw
jumped
with
horrified
exclamation
and
hurriedly
taking
case
bottle
from
cupboard
gave
some
brandy
which
few
minutes
somewhat
restored
brain
was
all
whirl
and
only
that
there
came
through
all
the
multitude
horrors
the
holy
ray
light
that
dear
dear
lucy
was
last
peace
not
think
could
have
borne
without
making
scene
all
wild
and
mysterious
and
strange
that
had
not
known
jonathan
experience
transylvania
could
not
have
believed
was
didn
know
what
believe
and
got
out
difficulty
attending
something
else
took
the
cover
off
typewriter
and
said
seward
let
write
this
all
out
now
must

accordingly
set
the
phonograph
slow
pace
and
began
typewrite
from
the
beginning
the
seventh
cylinder
used
manifold
and
took
three
copies
the
diary
just
had
done
with
all
the
rest
was
late
when
got
through
but
seward
went
about
his
work
going
his
round
the
patients
when
had
finished
came
back
and
sat
near
reading
that
did
not
feel
too
lonely
whilst
worked
how
good
and
thoughtful
the
world
seems
full
good
men
even
there
are
monsters
before
left
him
remembered
what
jonathan
put
his
diary
the
professor
perturbation
reading
something
evening
paper
the
station
exeter
seeing
that
seward
keeps
his
newspapers
borrowed
the
files
the
westminster
gazette
and
the
pall
mall
gazette
and
took
them
room
remember
how
much
the
dailygraph
and
the
whitby
gazette
which
had
made
cuttings
helped
understand
the
terrible
events
whitby
when
count
dracula
landed
shall
look
through
the
evening
papers
since
then
and
perhaps
shall
get
some
new
light
not
sleepy
and
the
work
will
help
keep
quiet
seward

september
harker
arrived
nine
clock
had
got
his
wife
wire
just
before
starting
uncommonly
clever
one
can
judge
from
his
face
and
full
energy
this
journal
true
and
judging
one
own
wonderful
experiences
must
also
man
great
nerve
that
going
down
the
vault
second
time
was
remarkable
piece
daring
after
reading
his
account
was
prepared
meet
good
specimen
manhood
but
hardly
the
quiet
business
like
gentleman
who
came
here
day
later
after
lunch
harker
and
his
wife
went
back
their
own
room
and
passed
while
ago
heard
the
click
the
typewriter
they
are
hard
mrs
harker
says
that
they
are
knitting
together
chronological
order
every
scrap
evidence
they
have
harker
has
got
the
letters
between
the
consignee
the
boxes
whitby
and
the
carriers
london
who
took
charge
them
now
reading
his
wife
typescript
diary
wonder
what
they
make
out
here
strange
that
never
struck
that
the
very
next
house
might
the
count
hiding
place
goodness
knows
that
had
enough
clues
from
the
conduct
the
patient
renfield
the
bundle
letters
relating
the
purchase
the
house
were
with
the
typescript
had
only
had
them
earlier
might
have
saved
poor
lucy
stop
that
way
madness
lies
harker
has
gone
back
and
again
collating
his
material
says
that
dinner
time
they
will
able
show
whole
connected
narrative
thinks
that
the
meantime
should
see
renfield
hitherto
has
been
sort
index
the
coming
and
going
the
count
hardly
see
this
yet
but
when
get
the
dates
suppose
shall
what
good
thing
that
mrs
harker
put
cylinders
into
type
never
could
have
found
the
dates
otherwise
found
renfield
sitting
placidly
his
room
with
his
hands
folded
smiling
benignly
the
moment
seemed
sane
any
one
ever
saw
sat
down
and
talked
with
him
lot

all
which
treated
naturally
then
his
own
accord
spoke

never

during
his
sojourn
here
fact
spoke
quite
confidently
getting
his
discharge
once
believe
that
had
not
had
the
chat
with
harker
and
read
the
letters
and
the
dates
his
outbursts
should
have
been
prepared
sign
for
him
after
brief
time
observation
darkly
suspicious
all
those
outbreaks
were
some
way
linked
with
the
proximity
the
count
what
then
does
this
absolute
content
mean
can
that
his
instinct
satisfied
the
vampire
ultimate
triumph
stay
himself
zoöphagous
and
his
wild
ravings
outside
the
chapel
door
the
deserted
house
always
spoke

this
all
seems
confirmation
our
idea
however
after
while
came
away
friend
just
little
too
sane

him
too
deep
with

then

they
all

billington
had

everything

been

thought
out
and
done
systematically

with

americanism
had
taken
chances
and
the
absolute
accuracy
with
which
his

were
fulfilled
was
simply
the
logical

his

saw
the

and
took
note
fifty

also
the

their

this
was
all
the
information
billington
could
give
went
down
the
port
and
saw
the
coastguards
the
customs
officers
and
the
harbour
master
they
had
all
something
say
the
strange
entry
the
ship
which
already
taking
its
place
local
tradition
but
one
could
add
the
simple
description
fifty
cases
common
earth
then
saw
the
station
master
who
kindly
put
communication
with
the
men
who
had
actually
received
the
boxes
their
tally
was
exact
with
the
list
and
they
had
nothing
add
except
that
the
boxes
were
main
and
mortal
heavy
and
that
shifting
them
was
dry
work
one
them
added
that
was
hard

that
there
wasn
any

such
like

some
sort
appreciation
their

liquid

that
the

then
generated
was
such
that
even
the
time
which
had
elapsed
had
not
completely
allayed
needless
add
took
care
before
leaving
lift
for

and
adequately
this

reproach
september
the
station
master
was
good
enough
give
line
his
old
companion
the
station
master
king
cross
that
when
arrived
there
the
morning
was
able
ask
him
about
the
arrival
the
boxes
too
put
once
communication
with
the
proper
officials
and
saw
that
their
tally
was
correct
with
the
original
invoice
the
opportunities
acquiring
abnormal
thirst
had
been
here
limited
noble
use
them
had
however
been
made
and
again
was
compelled
deal
with
the
result
post

manner
from
thence
went

paterson
central
office
where
met
with
the
utmost
courtesy
they
looked
the

and
once
telephoned
their
king
cross
office
for
more

good
fortune
the

did
the

were
waiting
for

and
the

all
the

connected
with

here
again
found
the
tally
agreeing
exactly
the
carriers
men
were
able
supplement
the
paucity
the
written
words
with
few
details
these
were
shortly
found
connected
almost
solely
with
the
dusty
nature
the
job
and
the
consequent
thirst
engendered
the
operators
affording
opportunity
through
the
medium
the
currency

glad
that
hardly
know
how
contain
myself
suppose
the
reaction
from
the
haunting
fear
which
have
had
that
this
terrible
affair
and
the
reopening
his
old
wound
might
act
detrimentally
jonathan
saw
him
leave
for
whitby
with
brave
face
could
but
was
sick
with
apprehension
the
effort
has
however
done
him
good
was
never
resolute
never
strong
never
full
volcanic
energy
present
just
that
dear
good
professor
van
helsing
said
true
grit
and
improves
under
strain
that
would
kill
weaker
nature
came
back
full
life
and
hope
and
determination
have
got
everything
order
for
night
feel
myself
quite
wild
with
excitement
suppose
one
ought
pity
any
thing
hunted
the
count
that
just
this
thing
not
human
not
even
beast
read
seward
account
poor
lucy
death
and
what
followed
enough
dry
the
springs
pity
one
heart
later
lord
godalming
and
morris
arrived
earlier
than
expected
seward
was
out
business
and
had
taken
jonathan
with
him
had
see
them
was
painful
meeting
for
brought
back
all
poor
dear
lucy
hopes
only
few
months
ago
course
they
had
heard
lucy
speak
and
seemed
that
van
helsing
too
has
been
quite
blowing
trumpet
morris
expressed
poor
fellows
neither
them
aware
that
know
all
about
the
proposals
they
made
lucy
they
did
not
quite
know
what
say
they
were
ignorant
the
amount
knowledge
they
had
keep
neutral
subjects
however
thought
the
matter
over
and
came
the
conclusion
that
the
best
thing
could
would
post
them
affairs
right
date
knew
from
seward
diary
that
they
had
been
lucy
death
her
real
death
and
that
need
not
fear
betray
any
secret
before
the
time
told
them
well
could
that
had
read
all
the
papers
and
diaries
and
that
husband
and
having
typewritten
them
had
just
finished
putting
them
order
gave
them
each
copy
read
the
library
when
lord
godalming
got
his
and
turned
over
does
make
pretty
good
pile
said
did
you
write
all
this
mrs
harker
nodded
and
went
don
quite
see
the
drift
but
you
people
are
all
good
and
kind
and
have
been
working
earnestly
and
energetically
that
all
can
accept
your
ideas
blindfold
and
try
help
you
have
had
one
lesson
already
accepting
facts
that
should
make
man
humble
the
last
hour
his
life
besides
know
you
loved
poor
lucy
here
turned
away
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
could
hear
the
tears
his
voice
morris
with
instinctive
delicacy
just
laid
hand
for
moment
his
shoulder
and
then
walked
quietly
out
the
room
suppose
there
something
woman
nature
that
makes
man
free
break
down
before
her
and
express
his
feelings
the
tender
emotional
side
without
feeling
derogatory
his
manhood
for
when
lord
godalming
found
himself
alone
with
sat
down
the
sofa
and
gave
way
utterly
and
openly
sat
down
beside
him
and
took
his
hand
hope
didn
think
forward
and
that
ever
thinks
afterwards
never
will
have
such
thought
there
wrong
him
know
never
will
too
true
gentleman
said
him
for
could
see
that
his
heart
was
breaking
loved
dear
lucy
and
know
what
she
was
you
and
what
you
were
her
she
and
were
like
sisters
and
now
she
gone
will
you
not
let
like
sister
you
your
trouble
know
what
sorrows
you
have
had
though
cannot
measure
the
depth
them
sympathy
and
pity
can
help
your
affliction
won
you
let
some
little
service
for
lucy
sake
instant
the
poor
dear
fellow
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
seemed
that
all
that
had
late
been
suffering
silence
found
vent
once
grew
quite
hysterical
and
raising
his
open
hands
beat
his
palms
together
perfect
agony
grief
stood
and
then
sat
down
again
and
the
tears
rained
down
his
cheeks
felt
infinite
pity
for
him
and
opened
arms
unthinkingly
with
sob
laid
his
head
shoulder
and
cried
like
wearied
child
whilst
shook
with
emotion
women
have
something
the
mother
that
makes
rise
above
smaller
matters
when
the
mother
spirit
invoked
felt
this
big
sorrowing
man
head
resting
though
were
that
the
baby
that
some
day
may
lie
bosom
and
stroked
his
hair
though
were
own
child
never
thought
the
time
how
strange
all
was
after
little
bit
his
sobs
ceased
and
raised
himself
with
apology
though
made
disguise
his
emotion
told
that
for
days
and
nights
past
weary
days
and
sleepless
nights
had
been
unable
speak
with
any
one
man
must
speak
his
time
sorrow
there
was
woman
whose
sympathy
could
given
him
with
whom
owing
the
terrible
circumstance
with
which
his
sorrow
was
surrounded
could
speak
freely
know
now
how
suffered
said
dried
his
eyes
but
not
know
even
yet
and
none
other
can
ever
know
how
much
your
sweet
sympathy
has
been
day
shall
know
better
time
and
believe
that
though
not
ungrateful
now
gratitude
will
grow
with
understanding
you
will
let
like
brother
will
you
not
for
all
our
lives
for
dear
lucy
sake
for
dear
lucy
sake
said
clasped
hands
and
for
your
own
sake
added
for
man
esteem
and
gratitude
are
ever
worth
the
winning
you
have
won
mine
day
ever
the
future
should
bring
you
time
when
you
need
man
help
believe
you
will
not
call
vain
god
grant
that
such
time
may
ever
come
you
break
the
sunshine
your
life
but
should
ever
come
promise
that
you
will
let
know
was
earnest
and
his
sorrow
was
fresh
that
felt
would
comfort
him
said
promise
came
along
the
corridor
saw
morris
looking
out
window
turned
heard
footsteps
how
art
said
then
noticing
red
eyes
went
see
you
have
been
comforting
him
poor
old
fellow
needs
one
but
woman
can
help
man
when
trouble
the
heart
and
had
one
comfort
him
bore
his
own
trouble
bravely
that
heart
bled
for
him
saw
the
manuscript
his
hand
and
knew
that
when
read
would
realise
how
much
knew
said
him
wish
could
comfort
all
who
suffer
from
the
heart
will
you
let
your
friend
and
will
you
come
for
comfort

need

will
know
later
why
speak
saw
that
was
earnest
and
stooping
took
hand
and
raising
his
lips
kissed
seemed
but
poor
comfort
brave
and
unselfish
soul
and
impulsively
bent
over
and
kissed
him
the
tears
rose
his
eyes
and
there
was
momentary
choking
his
throat
said
quite
calmly
little
girl
you
will
never
regret
that
true
hearted
kindness
long
ever
you
live
then
went
into
the
study

very
words

seward
diary
september
got
home
five
clock
and
found
that
godalming
and
morris
had
not
only
arrived
but
had
already
studied
the
transcript
the
various
diaries
and
letters
which
harker
and
his
wonderful
wife
had
made
and
arranged
harker
had
not
yet
returned
from
his
visit
the
carriers
men
whom
hennessey
had
written
mrs
harker
gave
cup
tea
and
can
honestly
say
that
for
the
first
time
since
have
lived
this
old
house
seemed
like
home
when
had
finished
mrs
harker
said
seward
may
ask
favour
want
see
your
patient
renfield
let
see
him
what
you
have
said
him
your
diary
interests
much
she
looked
appealing
and
pretty
that
could
not
refuse
her
and
there
was
possible
reason
why
should
took
her
with
when
went
into
the
room
told
the
man
that
lady
would
like
see
him
which
simply
answered
why
she
going
through
the
house
and
wants
see
every
one
answered
very
well
said
let
her
come
all
means
but
just
wait
minute
till
tidy
the
place
his
method
tidying
was
peculiar
simply
swallowed
all
the
flies
and
spiders
the
boxes
before
could
stop
him
was
quite
evident
that
feared
was
jealous
some
interference
when
had
got
through
his
disgusting
task
said
cheerfully
let
the
lady
come
and
sat
down
the
edge
his
bed
with
his
head
down
but
with
his
eyelids
raised
that
could
see
her
she
entered
for
moment
thought
that
might
have
some
homicidal
intent
remembered
how
quiet
had
been
just
before
attacked
own
study
and
took
care
stand
where
could
seize
him
once
attempted
make
spring
her
she
came
into
the
room
with
easy
gracefulness
which
would
once
command
the
respect
any
lunatic
for
easiness
one
the
qualities
mad
people
most
respect
she
walked
over
him
smiling
pleasantly
and
held
out
her
hand
good
evening
renfield
said
she
you
see
know
you
for
seward
has
told
you
made
immediate
reply
but
eyed
her
all
over
intently
with
set
frown
his
face
this
look
gave
way
one
wonder
which
merged
doubt
then
intense
astonishment
said
you
not
the
girl
the
doctor
wanted
marry
are
you
you
can
you
know
for
she
dead
mrs
harker
smiled
sweetly
she
replied
have
husband
own
whom
was
married
before
ever
saw
seward
mrs
harker
then
what
are
you
doing
here
husband
and
are
staying
visit
with
seward
then
don
stay
but
why
not
thought
that
this
style
conversation
might
not
pleasant
mrs
harker
any
more
than
was
joined
how
did
you
know
wanted
marry
any
one
his
reply
was
simply
contemptuous
given
pause
which
turned
his
eyes
from
mrs
harker
instantly
turning
them
back
again
what
asinine
question
don
see
that
all
renfield
said
mrs
harker
once
championing
replied
her
with
much
courtesy
and
respect
had
shown
contempt
you
will
course
understand
mrs
harker
that
when
man
loved
and
honoured
our
host
everything
regarding
him
interest
our
little
community
seward
loved
not
only
his
household
and
his
friends
but
even
his
patients
who
being
some
them
hardly
mental
equilibrium
are
apt
distort
causes
and
effects
since
myself
have
been
inmate
lunatic
asylum
cannot
but
notice
that
the
sophistic
tendencies
some
its
inmates
lean
towards
the
errors
non
causa
and
ignoratio
elenchi
positively
opened
eyes
this
new
development
here
was
own
pet
lunatic
the
most
pronounced
his
type
that
had
ever
met
with
talking
elemental
philosophy
and
with
the
manner
polished
gentleman
wonder
was
mrs
harker
presence
which
had
touched
some
chord
his
memory
this
new
phase
was
spontaneous
any
way
due
her
unconscious
influence
she
must
have
some
rare
gift
power
continued
talk
for
some
time
and
seeing
that
was
seemingly
quite
reasonable
she
ventured
looking
questioningly
she
began
lead
him
his
favourite
topic
was
again
astonished
for
addressed
himself
the
question
with
the
impartiality
the
completest
sanity
even
took
himself
example
when
mentioned
certain
things
why
myself
instance
man
who
had
strange
belief
indeed
was
wonder
that
friends
were
alarmed
and
insisted
being
put
under
control
used
fancy
that
life
was
positive
and
perpetual
entity
and
that
consuming
multitude
live
things
matter
how
low
the
scale
creation
one
might
indefinitely
prolong
life
times
held
the
belief
strongly
that
actually
tried
take
human
life
the
doctor
here
will
bear
out
that
one
occasion
tried
kill
him
for
the
purpose
strengthening
vital
powers
the
assimilation
with
own
body
his
life
through
the
medium
his
blood
relying
course
upon
the
scriptural
phrase
for
the
blood
the
life
though
indeed
the
vendor
certain
nostrum
has
vulgarised
the
truism
the
very
point
contempt
isn
that
true
doctor
nodded
assent
for
was
amazed
that
hardly
knew
what
either
think
say
was
hard
imagine
that
had
seen
him
eat
his
spiders
and
flies
not
five
minutes
before
looking
watch
saw
that
should
the
station
meet
van
helsing
told
mrs
harker
that

came
once
after

pleasantly

astonishment
replied

hereafter

and
besides
she

must
consult
with

heartily
with
him
and
then
told
him
what
had
found
his
absence
that
the
house
which
dracula
had
bought
was
the
very
next
one

amazed
and
great
concern
seemed
come
him
that
had
known
before
said
for
then
might
have
reached
him
time
save
poor
lucy
however
the
milk
that
spilt
cries
not
out
afterwards
you
say

not
think
that
but
our

end
then
fell
into
silence
that
lasted
till
entered

gateway
before
went
prepare
for

said
mrs
harker
told
madam
mina
friend

make
his
record
and
from
all
the
means
that
are
tell
what
has
been
must
indeed
have
been
that
voivode
dracula
who
won
his
name
against
the
turk
over
the
great
river
the
very
frontier
turkey
land
then
was
common
man
for
that
time
and
for
centuries
after
was
spoken
the
cleverest
and
the
most
cunning
well
the
bravest
the
sons
the
land
beyond
the
forest
that
mighty
brain
and
that
iron
resolution
went
with
him
his
grave
and
are
even
now
arrayed
against
the
draculas
were
says
arminius
great
and
noble
race
though
now
and
again
were
scions
who
were
held
their
coevals
have
had
dealings
with
the
evil
one
they
learned
his
secrets
the
scholomance
amongst
the
mountains
over
lake
hermanstadt
where
the
devil
claims
the
tenth
scholar
his
due
the
records
are
such
words
stregoica
witch
ordog
and
pokol
satan
and
hell
and
one
manuscript
this
very
dracula
spoken
wampyr
which
all
understand
too
well
there
have
been
from
the
loins
this
very
one
great
men
and
good
women
and
their
graves
make
sacred
the
earth
where
alone
this
foulness
can
dwell
for
not
the
least
its
terrors
that
this
evil
thing
rooted
deep
all
good
soil
barren
holy
memories
cannot
rest
whilst
they
were
talking
morris
was
looking
steadily
the
window
and
now
got
quietly
and
went
out
the
room
there
was
little
pause
and
then
the
professor
went
and
now
must
settle
what
have
here
much
data
and
must
proceed
lay
out
our
campaign
know
from
the
inquiry
jonathan
that
from
the
castle
whitby
came
fifty
boxes
earth
all
which
were
delivered
carfax
also
know
that
least
some
these
boxes
have
been
removed
seems
that
our
first
step
should
ascertain
whether
all
the
rest
remain
the
house
beyond
that
wall
where
look
day
whether
any
more
have
been
removed
the
latter
must
trace
here
were
interrupted
very
startling
way
outside
the
house
came
the
sound
pistol
shot
the
glass
the
window
was
shattered
with
bullet
which
ricochetting
from
the
top
the
embrasure
struck
the
far
wall
the
room
afraid
heart
coward
for
shrieked
out
the
men
all
jumped
their
feet
lord
godalming
flew
over
the
window
and
threw
the
sash
did
heard
morris
voice
without
sorry
fear
have
alarmed
you
shall
come
and
tell
you
about
minute
later
came
and
said
was
idiotic
thing
and
ask
your
pardon
mrs
harker
most
sincerely
fear
must
have
frightened
you
terribly
but
the
fact
that
whilst
the
professor
was
talking
there
came
big
bat
and
sat
the
window
sill
have
got
such
horror
the
damned
brutes
from
recent
events
that
cannot
stand
them
and
went
out
have
shot
have
been
doing
late
evenings
whenever
have
seen
one
you
used
laugh
for
then
art
did
you
hit
asked
van
helsing
don
know
fancy
not
for
flew
away
into
the
wood
without
saying
any
more
took
his
seat
and
the
professor
began
resume
his
statement
must
trace
each
these
boxes
and
when
are
ready
must
either
capture
kill
this
monster
his
lair
must
speak
sterilise
the
earth
that
more
can
seek
safety
thus
the
end
may
find
him
his
form
man
between
the
hours
noon
and
sunset
and
engage
with
him
when
his
most
weak
and
now
for
you
madam
mina
this
night
the
end
until
all
well
you
are
too
precious
have
such
risk
when
part
night
you
more
must
question
shall
tell
you
all
good
time
are
men
and
are
able
bear
but
you
must
our
star
and
our
hope
and
shall
act
all
the
more
free
that
you
are
not
the
danger
such
are
all
the
men
even
jonathan
seemed
relieved
but
did
not
seem
good
that
they
should
brave
danger
and
perhaps
lessen
their
safety
strength
being
the
best
safety
through
care
but
their
minds
were
made
and
though
was
bitter
pill
for
swallow
could
say
nothing
save
accept
their
chivalrous
care
morris
resumed
the
discussion
there
time
lose
vote
have
look
his
house
right
now
time
everything
with
him
and
swift
action
our
part
may
save
another
victim
own
that
heart
began
fail
when
the
time
for
action
came
close
but
did
not
say
anything
for
had
greater
fear
that
appeared
drag
hindrance
their
work
they
might
even
leave
out
their
counsels
altogether
they
have
now
gone
off
carfax
with
means
get
into
the
house
manlike
they
had
told
bed
and
sleep
woman
can
sleep
when
those
she
loves
are
danger
shall
lie
down
and
pretend
sleep
lest
jonathan
have
added
anxiety
about
when
returns
seward
diary
october
just
were
about
leave
the
house
urgent
message
was
brought
from
renfield
know
would
see
him
once
had
something
the
utmost
importance
say
told
the
messenger
say
that
would
attend
his
wishes
the
morning
was
busy
just
the
moment
the
attendant
added
seems
very
importunate
sir
have
never
seen
him
eager
don
know
but
what
you
don
see
him
soon
will
have
one
his
violent
fits
knew
the
man
would
not
have
said
this
without
some
cause
said
all
right
now
and
asked
the
others
wait
few
minutes
for
had
and
see
patient
take
with
you
friend
john
said
the
professor
his
case
your
diary
interest
much
and
had
bearing
too
now
and
again
our
case
should
much
like
see
him
and
especial
when
his
mind
disturbed
may
come
also
asked
lord
godalming
too
said
quincey
morris
may
come
said
harker
nodded
and
all
went
down
the
passage
together
found
him
state
considerable
excitement
but
far
more
rational
his
speech
and
manner
than
had
ever
seen
him
there
was
unusual
understanding
himself
which
was
unlike
anything
had
ever
met
with
lunatic
and
took
for
granted
that
his
reasons
would
prevail
with
others
entirely
sane
all
four
went
into
the
room
but
none
the
others
first
said
anything
his
request
was
that
would
once
release
him
from
the
asylum
and
send
him
home
this
backed
with
arguments
regarding
his
complete
recovery
and
adduced
his
own
existing
sanity
appeal
your
friends
said
they
will
perhaps
not
mind
sitting
judgment
case
the
way
you
have
not
introduced
was
much
astonished
that
the
oddness
introducing
madman
asylum
did
not
strike
the
moment
and
besides
there
was
certain
dignity
the
man
manner
much
the
habit
equality
that
once
made
the
introduction
lord
godalming
professor
van
helsing
quincey
morris
texas
renfield
shook
hands
with
each
them
saying
turn
lord
godalming
had
the
honour
seconding
your
father
the
windham
grieve
know
your
holding
the
title
that
more
was
man
loved
and
honoured
all
who
knew
him
and
his
youth
was
have
heard
the
inventor
burnt
rum
punch
much
patronised
derby
night
morris
you
should
proud
your
great
state
its
reception
into
the
union
was
precedent
which
may
have
far
reaching
effects
hereafter
when
the
pole
and
the
tropics
may
hold
alliance
the
stars
and
stripes
the
power
treaty
may
yet
prove
vast
engine
enlargement
when
the
monroe
doctrine
takes
its
true
place
political
fable
what
shall
any
man
say
his
pleasure
meeting
van
helsing
sir
make
apology
for
dropping
all
forms
conventional
prefix
when
individual
has
revolutionised
therapeutics
his
discovery
the
continuous
evolution
brain
matter
conventional
forms
are
unfitting
since
they
would
seem
limit
him
one
class
you
gentlemen
who
nationality
heredity
the
possession
natural
gifts
are
fitted
hold
your
respective
places
the
moving
world
take
witness
that
sane
least
the
majority
men
who
are
full
possession
their
liberties
and
sure
that
you
seward
humanitarian
and
medico
jurist
well
scientist
will
deem
moral
duty
deal
with
one
considered
under
exceptional
circumstances
made
this
last
appeal
with
courtly
air
conviction
which
was
not
without
its
own
charm
think
were
all
staggered
for
own
part
was
under
the
conviction
despite
knowledge
the
man
character
and
history
that
his
reason
had
been
restored
and
felt
under
strong
impulse
tell
him
that
was
satisfied
his
sanity
and
would
see
about
the
necessary
formalities
for
his
release
the
morning
thought
better
wait
however
before
making
grave
statement
for
old
knew
the
sudden
changes
which
this
particular
patient
was
liable
contented
myself
with
making
general
statement
that
appeared
improving
very
rapidly
that
would
have
longer
chat
with
him
the
morning
and
would
then
see
what
could
the
direction
meeting
his
wishes
this
did
not
all
satisfy
him
for
said
quickly
but
fear
seward
that
you
hardly
apprehend
wish
desire
once
here
now
this

looked
keenly
and
seeing
the

turned
the

and
scrutinised
them
closely
not
meeting
any
sufficient
response
went
possible
that
have
erred
supposition
you
have
said
frankly
but
the
same
time
felt
brutally
there
was
considerable
pause
and
then
said
slowly
then
suppose

only
shift
ground
request
let
ask
for
this
concession
boon
privilege
what
you
will
content
implore
such
case
not

but
for
the
sake

not

give
you
the
whole

but
you
may
assure
you
take
from
that
they
are
good
ones
sound
and
unselfish
and
spring
from

looked
all
keenly

growing
conviction
that
this
sudden
change
his
entire
intellectual
method
was
but
yet
another
form
phase
his
madness
and
determined
let
him
little
longer
knowing
from
experience
that
would
like
all
lunatics
give
himself
away
the
end
van

gazing
him
with
look

intensity
his
bushy
eyebrows
almost
meeting
with
the
fixed
concentration
his
look

which
did
not
surprise
the
time
but
only
when
thought
afterwards
for

frankly
your
real
reason
for

will
satisfy
even
stranger
without
prejudice
and
with
the
habit
keeping
open

seward
will
give
you
his
own
risk
and
his
own
responsibility
the
privilege
you
seek
shook
his
head
sadly
and
with
look
poignant
regret
his
face
the
professor
went
come
sir
bethink
yourself
you
claim
the
privilege
reason
the
highest
degree
since
you
seek

with
your
complete
reasonableness

since

for
this
very
defect
you
will
not

have
nothing

complete
and
were
free

should
not
hesitate
moment
but
not
own
master
the
matter
can
only
ask
you
trust
refused
the
responsibility
does
not
rest
with
thought
was
now
time
end
the
scene
which
was
becoming
too
comically
grave
went
towards
the
door
simply
saying
come
friends
have
work
good
night
however
got
near
the
door
new
change
came
over
the
patient
moved
towards
quickly
that
for
the
moment
feared
that
was
about
make
another
homicidal
attack
fears
however
were
groundless
for
held
his
two
hands
imploringly
and
made
his
petition
moving
manner
saw
that
the
very
excess
his
emotion
was
militating
against
him
restoring
more
our
old
relations
became
still
more
demonstrative
glanced
van
helsing
and
saw
conviction
reflected
his
eyes
became
little
more
fixed
manner
not
more
stern
and
motioned
him
that
his
efforts
were
unavailing
had
previously
seen
something
the
same
constantly
growing
excitement
him
when
had
make
some
request
which
the
time
had
thought
much
such
for
instance
when
wanted
cat
and
was
prepared
see
the
collapse
into
the
same
sullen
acquiescence
this
occasion
expectation
was
not
realised
for
when
found
that
his
appeal
would
not
successful
got
into
quite
frantic
condition
threw
himself
his
knees
and
held
his
hands
wringing
them
plaintive
supplication
and
poured
forth
torrent
entreaty
with
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
and
his
whole
face
and
form
expressive
the
deepest
emotion
let
entreat
you
seward
let
implore

discreetly
suddenly
stopped
and
looked
intently
for
several
moments
then
without
word
rose
and
moving
over
sat
down
the
side
the
bed
the
collapse

went
with
the
party
the
search
with
easy
mind
for
think
never
saw
mina
absolutely
strong
and
well
glad
that
she
consented
hold
back
and
let
men
the
work
somehow
was
dread
that
she
was
this
fearful
business
all
but
now
that
her
work
done
and
that
due
her
energy
and
brains
and
foresight
that
the
whole
story
put
together
such
way
that
every
point
tells
she
may
well
feel
that
her
part
finished
and
that
she
can
henceforth
leave
the

were
think
all
little
upset
the
scene
with
renfield
when
came
away
from
his
room
were
silent
till
got
back
the
study
then
morris
said
seward
say
jack
that
man
wasn
attempting
bluff
about
the
sanest
lunatic
ever
saw
not
sure
but
believe
that
had
some
serious
purpose
and
had
was
pretty
rough
him
not
get

godalming
and
were
silent
but
van
helsing
added
friend
john
you
know
more
lunatics
than
and
glad
for
fear
that
had
been
decide
would
before
that
last
hysterical
outburst
have
given
him
free
but
live
and
learn
and
our
present
task
must
take
chance
friend
quincey
would
say
all
best
they
are
seward
seemed
answer
them
both
dreamy
kind
way
don
know
but
that
agree
with
you
that
man
had
been
ordinary
lunatic
would
have
taken
chance
trusting
him
but
seems
mixed
with
the
count
indexy
kind
way
that
afraid
doing
anything
wrong
helping
his
fads
can
forget
how
prayed
with
almost
equal
fervour
for
cat
and
then
tried
tear
throat
out
with
his
teeth
besides
called
the
count
lord
and
master
and
may
want
get
out
help
him
some
diabolical
way
that
horrid
thing
has
the
wolves
and
the
rats
and
his
own
kind
help
him
suppose
isn
above
trying

respectable
lunatic
certainly
did
seem
earnest
though
only
hope
have
done
what
best
these
things

with
the
wild
work

the
professor
stepped
over
and
laying
his
hand
his
shoulder
said
his
grave
kindly
way
friend
john
have
fear
are
trying
our
duty
very
sad
and
terrible
case
can
only
deem
best
what
else
have
hope
for
except
the
pity
the
good
god
lord
godalming
had
slipped
away
for
few
minutes
but
now
returned
held
little
silver
whistle
remarked
that

got

having
passed
the

took
our
way
the
house
taking
care
keep
the
shadows
the
trees
the
lawn
when
the
moonlight
shone
out
when
got
the
porch
the
professor
opened
his
bag
and
took
out
lot
things
which
laid
the
step
sorting
them
into
four
little
groups
evidently
one
for
each
then
spoke
friends
are
going
into
terrible
danger
and
need

many

our
enemy

remember
that
has

that
though

therefore
guard

from

spoke
lifted

this

for

all
these
small

equipped
now
said
friend
john
where
are
the
skeleton
keys
that
can
open

the

before
miss

tried
one
two

his
mechanical

surgeon
standing
him
good
stead
presently
got
one
suit
after
little
play
back
and
forward
the
bolt
yielded
and
with
rusty
clang
shot
back
pressed
the
door
the
rusty
hinges
creaked
and
slowly
opened
was
startlingly
like
the
image
conveyed
seward

the
opening
miss
westenra
tomb
fancy
that
the
same
idea
seemed
strike
the
others
for
with
one
accord
they
shrank
back
the
professor
was
the
first
move
forward
and
stepped
into
the
open
door
manus
tuas
domine
said
crossing
himself
passed
over
the
threshold
closed
the
door
behind
lest
when
should
have
lit
our
lamps
should
possibly
attract
attention
from
the
road
the
professor
carefully
tried
the
lock
lest
might
not
able
open
from
within
should
hurry
making
our
exit
then
all
lit
our
lamps
and
proceeded
our
search
the
light
from
the
tiny
lamps
fell
all
sorts
odd
forms
the
rays
crossed
each
other
the
opacity
our
bodies
threw
great
shadows
could
not
for
life
get
away
from
the
feeling
that
there
was
some
one
else
amongst
suppose
was
the
recollection
powerfully
brought
home
the
grim
surroundings
that
terrible
experience
transylvania
think
the
feeling
was
common
all
for
noticed
that
the
others
kept
looking
over
their
shoulders
every
sound
and
every
new
shadow
just
felt
myself
doing
the
whole
place
was
thick
with
dust
the
floor
was
seemingly
inches
deep
except
where
there
were
recent
footsteps
which
holding
down
lamp
could
see
marks
hobnails
where
the
dust
was
cracked
the
walls
were
fluffy
and
heavy
with
dust
and
the
corners
were
masses
spider
webs
whereon
the
dust
had
gathered
till
they
looked
like
old
tattered
rags
the
weight
had
torn
them
partly
down
table
the
hall
was
great
bunch
keys
with
time
yellowed
label
each
they
had
been
used
several
times
for
the
table
were
several
similar
rents
the
blanket
dust
similar
that
exposed
when
the
professor
lifted
them
turned
and
said
you
know
this
place
jonathan
you
have
copied
maps
and
you
know
least
more
than
which
the
way
the
chapel
had
idea
its
direction
though
former
visit
had
not
been
able
get
admission
led
the
way
and
after
few
wrong
turnings
found
myself
opposite
low
arched
oaken
door
ribbed
with
iron
bands
this
the
spot
said
the
professor
turned
his
lamp
small
map
the
house
copied
from
the
file
original
correspondence
regarding
the
purchase
with
little
trouble
found
the
key
the
bunch
and
opened
the
door
were
prepared
for
some
unpleasantness
for
were
opening
the
door
faint
malodorous
air
seemed
exhale
through
the
gaps
but
none
ever
expected
such
odour
encountered
none
the
others
had
met
the
count
all
close
quarters
and
when
had
seen
him
was
either
the
fasting
stage
his
existence
his
rooms
when
was
gloated
with
fresh
blood
ruined
building
open
the
air
but
here
the
place
was
small
and
close
and
the
long
disuse
had
made
the
air
stagnant
and
foul
there
was
earthy
smell
some
dry
miasma
which
came
through
the
fouler
air
but
the
odour
itself
how
shall
describe
was
not
alone
that
was
composed
all
the
ills
mortality
and
with
the
pungent
acrid
smell
blood
but
seemed
though
corruption
had
become
itself
corrupt
faugh
sickens
think
every
breath
exhaled
that
monster
seemed
have
clung
the
place
and
intensified
its
loathsomeness
under
ordinary
circumstances
such
stench
would
have
brought
our
enterprise
end
but
this
was
ordinary
case
and
the
high
and
terrible
purpose
which
were
involved
gave
strength
which
rose
above
merely
physical
considerations
after
the
involuntary
shrinking
consequent
the
first
nauseous
whiff
one
and
all
set
about
our
work
though
that
loathsome
place
were
garden
roses
made
accurate
examination
the
place
the
professor
saying
began
the
first
thing
see
how
many
the
boxes
are
left
must
then
examine
every
hole
and
corner
and
cranny
and
see
cannot
get
some
clue
what
has
become
the
rest
glance
was
sufficient
show
how
many
remained
for
the
great
earth
chests
were
bulky
and
there
was
mistaking
them
there
were
only
twenty
nine
left
out
the
fifty
once
got
fright
for
seeing
lord
godalming
suddenly
turn
and
look
out
the
vaulted
door
into
the
dark
passage
beyond
looked
too
and
for
instant
heart
stood
still
somewhere
looking
out
from
the
shadow
seemed
see
the
high
lights
the
count
evil
face
the
ridge
the
nose
the
red
eyes
the
red
lips
the
awful
pallor
was
only
for
moment
for
lord
godalming
said
thought
saw
face
but
was
only
the
shadows
and
resumed
his
inquiry
turned
lamp
the
direction
and
stepped
into
the
passage
there
was
sign
any
one
and
there
were
corners
doors
aperture
any
kind
but
only
the
solid
walls
the
passage
there
could
hiding
place
even
for
him
took
that
fear
had
helped
imagination
and
said
nothing
few
minutes
later
saw
morris
step
suddenly
back
from
corner
which
was
examining
all
followed
his
movements
with
our
eyes
for
undoubtedly
some
nervousness
was
growing
and
saw
whole
mass
phosphorescence
which
twinkled
like
stars
all
instinctively
drew
back
the
whole
place
was
becoming
alive
with
rats
for
moment
two
stood
appalled
all
save
lord
godalming
who
was
seemingly
prepared
for
such
emergency
rushing
over
the
great
iron
bound
oaken
door
which
seward
had
described
from
the
outside
and
which
had
seen
myself
turned
the
key
the
lock
drew
the
huge
bolts
and
swung
the
door
open
then
taking
his
little
silver
whistle
from
his
pocket
blew
low
shrill
call
was
answered
from
behind
seward
house
the
yelping
dogs
and
after
about
minute
three
terriers
came
dashing
round
the
corner
the
house
unconsciously
had
all
moved
towards
the
door
and
moved
noticed
that
the
dust
had
been
much
disturbed
the
boxes
which
had
been
taken
out
had
been
brought
this
way
but
even
the
minute
that
had
elapsed
the
number
the
rats
had
vastly
increased
they
seemed
swarm
over
the
place
all
once
till
the
lamplight
shining
their
moving
dark
bodies
and
glittering
baleful
eyes
made
the
place
look
like
bank
earth
set
with
fireflies
the
dogs
dashed
but
the
threshold
suddenly
stopped
and
snarled
and
then
simultaneously
lifting
their
noses
began
howl
most
lugubrious
fashion
the
rats
were
multiplying
thousands
and
moved
out
lord
godalming
lifted
one
the
dogs
and
carrying
him
placed
him
the
floor
the
instant
his
feet
touched
the
ground
seemed
recover
his
courage
and
rushed
his
natural
enemies
they
fled
before
him
fast
that
before
had
shaken
the
life
out
score
the
other
dogs
who
had
now
been
lifted
the
same
manner
had
but
small
prey
ere
the
whole
mass
had
vanished
with
their
going
seemed
some
evil
presence
had
departed
for
the
dogs
frisked
about
and
barked
merrily
they
made
sudden
darts
their
prostrate
foes
and
turned
them
over
and
over
and
tossed
them
the
air
with
vicious
shakes
all
seemed
find
our
spirits
rise
whether
was
the
purifying
the
deadly
atmosphere
the
opening
the
chapel
door
the
relief
which
experienced
finding
ourselves
the
open
know
not
but
most
certainly
the
shadow
dread
seemed
slip
from
like
robe
and
the
occasion
our
coming
lost
something
its
grim
significance
though
did
not
slacken
whit
our
resolution
closed
the
outer
door
and
barred
and
locked
and
bringing
the
dogs
with
began
our
search
the
house
found
nothing
throughout
except
dust
extraordinary
proportions
and
all
untouched
save
for

never
once
did
the

any
symptom
uneasiness
and
even
when
returned
the
chapel
they
frisked
about
though
they
had
been
rabbit

the
morning
was
quickening
the

taken
the

the

have
ascertained
how
many

more
than

that
this
our
first
and
perhaps
our
most
difficult
and
dangerous
step
has
been
accomplished
without
the

most
sweet
madam

that

many
nights
and
days
follow
full
peril
but
must
and
from
danger
shall
shrink
the
house
was
silent
when
got
back
save
for
some
poor
creature
who
was
screaming
away
one
the
distant
wards
and
low
moaning
sound
from
renfield
room
the
poor
wretch
was
doubtless
torturing
himself
after
the
manner
the
insane
with
needless
thoughts
pain
came
tiptoe
into
our
own
room
and
found
mina
asleep
breathing
softly
that
had
put
ear
down
hear
she
looks
paler
than
usual
hope
the
meeting
night
has
not
upset
her
truly
thankful
that
she
left
out
our
future
work
and
even
our
deliberations
too
great
strain
for
woman
bear
did
not
think
first
but
know
better
now
therefore
glad
that
settled
there
may
things
which
would
frighten
her
hear
and
yet
conceal
them
from
her
might
worse
than
tell
her
once
she
suspected
that
there
was
any
concealment
henceforth
our
work
sealed
book
her
till
least
such
time
can
tell
her
that
all
finished
and
the
earth
free
from
monster
the
nether
world
daresay
will
difficult
begin
keep
silence
after
such
confidence
ours
but
must
resolute
and
morrow
shall
keep
dark
over
night
doings
and
shall
refuse
speak
anything
that
has
happened
rest
the
sofa
not
disturb
her
october
later
suppose
was
natural
that
should
have
all
overslept
ourselves
for
the
day
was
busy
one
and
the
night
had
rest
all
even
mina
must
have
felt
its
exhaustion
for
though
slept
till
the
sun
was
high
was
awake
before
her
and
had
call
two
three
times
before
she
awoke
indeed
she
was
sound
asleep
that
for
few
seconds
she
did
not
recognize
but
looked
with
sort
blank
terror
one
looks
who
has
been
waked
out
bad
dream
she
complained
little
being
tired
and
let
her
rest
till
later
the
day
now
know
twenty
one
boxes
having
been
removed
and
that
several
were
taken
any
these
removals
may
able
trace
them
all
such
will
course
immensely
simplify
our
labour
and
the
sooner
the
matter
attended
the
better
shall
look

seward
diary
october
was
towards
noon
when
was
awakened
the
professor
walking
into
room
was
more
jolly
and
cheerful
than
usual
and
quite
evident
that
last
night
work
has
helped
take
some
the
brooding
weight
off
his
mind
after
going
over
the
adventure
the
night
suddenly
said

not
have

him
waiting
called

and
gave
him
the
necessary
instructions
before
the

left
the
room
cautioned
him
against
getting
any
false
impression
from

yesterday
that

once
had
such
belief
why
you
smile
friend
john
excuse
said
but
the
answer
here
laid
hand
the
type
written
matter
when
our
sane
and
learned
lunatic
made
that
very
statement
how
used
consume
life
his
mouth
was
actually
nauseous
with
the
flies
and
spiders
which
had
eaten
just
before
mrs

your
memory
true
friend

this
very
obliquity

and
memory
which
makes

disease
such
fascinating
study
perhaps
may
gain
more
knowledge
out
the
folly
this
madman
than
shall
from
the
teaching
the
most
wise
who
knows
went
with
work
and
before
long
was

such
measure
respect

journal
october
strange
kept
the
dark
day
after
jonathan
full
confidence
for
many
years
see
him
manifestly
avoid
certain
matters
and
those
the
most
vital
all
this
morning
slept
late
after
the
fatigues
yesterday
and
though
jonathan
was
late
too
was
the
earlier
spoke
before
went
out
never
more
sweetly
tenderly
but
never
mentioned
word
what
had
happened
the
visit
the
count
house
and
yet
must
have
known
how
terribly
anxious
was
poor
dear
fellow
suppose
must
have
distressed
him
even
more
than
did
they
all
agreed
that
was
best
that
should
not
drawn
further
into
this
awful
work
and
acquiesced
but
think
that
keeps
anything
from
and
now
crying
like
silly
fool
when
know
comes
from
husband
great
love
and
from
the
good
good
wishes
those
other
strong
men
that
has
done
good
well
some
day
jonathan
will
tell
all
and
lest
should
ever
that
should
think
for
moment
that
kept
anything
from
him
still
keep
journal
usual
then
has
feared
trust
shall
show
him
with
every
thought
heart
put
down
for
his
dear
eyes
read
feel
strangely
sad
and
low
spirited
day
suppose
the
reaction
from
the
terrible
excitement
last
night
went
bed
when
the
men
had
gone
simply
because
they
told
didn
feel
sleepy
and
did
feel
full
devouring
anxiety
kept
thinking
over
everything
that
has
been
ever
since
jonathan
came
see
london
and
all
seems
like
horrible
tragedy
with
fate
pressing
relentlessly
some
destined
end
everything
that
one
does
seems
matter
how
right
may
bring
the
very
thing
which
most
deplored
hadn
gone
whitby
perhaps
poor
dear
lucy
would
with
now
she
hadn
taken
visiting
the
churchyard
till
came
and
she
hadn
come
there
the
day
time
with
she
wouldn
have
walked
there
her
sleep
and
she
hadn
gone
there
night
and
asleep
that
monster
couldn
have
destroyed
her
did
why
did
ever
whitby
there
now
crying
again
wonder
what
has
come
over
day
must
hide
from
jonathan
for
knew
that
had
been
crying
twice
one
morning
who
never
cried
own
account
and
whom
has
never
caused
shed
tear
the
dear
fellow
would
fret
his
heart
out
shall
put
bold
face
and
feel
weepy
shall
never
see
suppose
one
the
lessons
that
poor
women
have
learn
can
quite
remember
how
fell
asleep
last
night
remember
hearing
the
sudden
barking
the
dogs
and
lot
queer
sounds
like
praying
very
tumultuous
scale
from
renfield
room
which
somewhere
under
this
and
then
there
was
silence
over
everything
silence
profound
that
startled
and
got
and
looked
out
the
window
all
was
dark
and
silent
the
black
shadows
thrown
the
moonlight
seeming
full
silent
mystery
their
own
not
thing
seemed
stirring
but
all
grim
and
fixed
death
fate
that
thin
streak
white
mist
that
crept
with
almost
imperceptible
slowness
across
the
grass
towards
the
house
seemed
have
sentience
and
vitality
its
own
think
that
the
digression
thoughts
must
have
done
good
for
when
got
back
bed
found
lethargy
creeping
over
lay
while
but
could
not
quite
sleep
got
out
and
looked
out
the
window
again
the
mist
was
spreading
and
was
now
close
the
house
that
could
see
lying
thick
against
the
wall
though
were
stealing
the
windows
the
poor
man
was
more
loud
than
ever
and
though
could
not
distinguish
word
said
could
some
way
recognise
his
tones
some
passionate
entreaty
his
part
then
there
was
the
sound
struggle
and
knew
that
the
attendants
were
dealing
with
him
was
frightened
that
crept
into
bed
and
pulled
the
clothes
over
head
putting
fingers
ears
was
not
then
bit
sleepy
least
thought
but
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
except
dreams
not
remember
anything
until
the
morning
when
jonathan
woke
think
that
took
effort
and
little
time
realise
where
was
and
that
was
jonathan
who
was
bending
over
dream
was
very
peculiar
and
was
almost
typical
the
way
that
waking
thoughts
become
merged
continued
dreams
thought
that
was
asleep
and
waiting
for
jonathan
come
back
was
very
anxious
about
him
and
was
powerless
act
feet
and
hands
and
brain
were
weighted
that
nothing
could
proceed
the
usual
pace
and
slept
uneasily
and
thought
then
began
dawn
upon
that
the
air
was
heavy
and
dank
and
cold
put
back
the
clothes
from
face
and
found
surprise
that
all
was
dim
around
the
gaslight
which
had
left
lit
for
jonathan
but
turned
down
came
only
like
tiny
red
spark
through
the
fog
which
had
evidently
grown
thicker
and
poured
into
the
room
then
occurred
that
had
shut
the
window
before
had
come
bed
would
have
got
out
make
certain
the
point
but
some
leaden
lethargy
seemed
chain
limbs
and
even
will
lay
still
and
endured
that
was
all
closed
eyes
but
could
still
see
through
eyelids
wonderful
what
tricks
our
dreams
play
and
how
conveniently
can
imagine
the
mist
grew
thicker
and
thicker
and
could
see
now
how
came
for
could
see
like
smoke
with
the
white
energy
boiling
water
pouring
not
through
the
window
but
through
the
joinings
the
door
got
thicker
and
thicker
till
seemed
became
concentrated
into
sort
pillar
cloud
the
room
through
the
top
which
could
see
the
light
the
gas
shining
like
red
eye
things
began
whirl
through
brain
just
the
cloudy
column
was
now
whirling
the
room
and
through
all
came
the
scriptural
words
pillar
cloud
day
and
fire
night
was
indeed
some
such
spiritual
guidance
that
was
coming
sleep
but
the
pillar
was
composed
both
the
day
and
the
night
guiding
for
the
fire
was
the
red
eye
which
the
thought
got
new
fascination
for
till
looked
the
fire
divided
and
seemed
shine
through
the
fog
like
two
red
eyes
such
lucy
told
her
momentary
mental
wandering
when
the
cliff
the
dying
sunlight
struck
the
windows
mary
church
suddenly
the
horror
burst
upon
that
was
thus
that
jonathan
had
seen
those
awful
women
growing
into
reality
though
the
whirling
mist
the
moonlight
and
dream
must
have
fainted
for
all
became
black
darkness
the
last
conscious
effort
which
imagination
made
was
show
livid
white
face
bending
over
out
the
mist
must
careful
such
dreams
for
they
would
unseat
one
reason
there
were
too
much
them
would
get
van
helsing
seward
prescribe
something
for
which
would
make
sleep
only
that
fear
alarm
them
such
dream
the
present
time
would
become
woven
into
their
fears
for
night
shall
strive
hard
sleep
naturally
not
shall
morrow
night
get
them
give
dose
chloral
that
cannot
hurt
for
once
and
will
give
good
night

last
night
tired
more
than
had
not
slept
all
october
last
night
slept
but
did
not

must
have
slept
soundly
for
was
not
waked

the

poor
man
was
very
gentle
and
when
came
away
kissed
hand
and
bade
god
bless
some
way
affected
much
crying
when
think
him
this
new
weakness
which
must
careful
jonathan
would
miserable
knew
had
been
crying
and
the
others
were
out
till
dinner
time
and
they
all
came
tired
did
what
could
brighten
them
and
suppose
that
the
effort
did
good
for
forgot
how
tired
was
after
dinner
they
sent
bed
and
all
went
off
smoke
together
they
said
but
knew
that
they
wanted
tell
each
other
what
had
occurred
each
during
the
day

see
from

that

sleepy

pale
and
far
from

determined
not
wake

but
that
when

think
she
would
happier
our

ignorance
only
saw

however
when

nobody
that
kind
livin
ere

had
left
for
his
work
poplar
five
clock
that
morning
could
not
tell
where
the
place
work
was
situated
but
had
vague
idea
that
was
some
kind
new
fangled
ware
and
with
this
slender
clue
had
start
for
poplar
was
twelve
clock
before
got
any
satisfactory
hint
such
building
and
this
got
coffee
shop
where
some
workmen
were
having
their
dinner
one
these
suggested
that
there
was
being
erected
cross

building
and
this
suited
the
condition
new
fangled
ware
once

both
whom
were
appeased
with

sent
for
suggesting
that
was
willing
pay
his
day
wages
his
foreman
for
the
privilege
asking
him
few
questions
private
matter
was
smart
enough
fellow
though
rough
speech
and
bearing
when
had
promised
pay
for
his
information
and
given
him
earnest
told
that
had
made
two
journeys
between
carfax
and

and
had
taken
from
this
house
the
latter
nine
great
boxes

one
that
thin
you
would
think

how
this
phrase
thrilled
through
why

till
the
lot

went
away
cussin
thought
that
with
this
description
could
find
the
house
having
paid
friend
for
his
information
started
off
for
piccadilly
had
gained
new
painful
experience
the
count
could
was
evident
handle
the
earth
boxes
himself
time
was
precious
for
now
that
had
achieved
certain
amount
distribution
could
choosing
his
own
time
complete
the
task
unobserved
piccadilly
circus
discharged
cab
and
walked
westward
beyond
the
junior
constitutional
came
across
the
house
described
and
was
satisfied
that
this
was
the
next
the
lairs
arranged
dracula
the
house
looked
though
had
been
long
untenanted
the
windows
were
encrusted
with
dust
and
the
shutters
were
all
the
framework
was
black
with
time
and
from
the
iron
the
paint
had
mostly
scaled
away
was
evident
that
lately
there
had
been
large
notice
board
front
the
balcony
had
however
been
roughly
torn
away
the
uprights
which
had
supported
still
remaining
behind
the
rails
the
balcony
saw
there
were
some
loose
boards
whose
raw
edges
looked
white
would
have
given
good
deal
have
been
able
see
the
notice
board
intact
would
perhaps
have
given
some
clue
the
ownership
the
house
remembered
experience
the
investigation
and
purchase
carfax
and
could
not
but
feel
that
could
find
the
former
owner
there
might
some
means
discovered
gaining
access
the
house
there
was
present
nothing
learned
from
the
piccadilly
side
and
nothing
could
done
went
round
the
back
see
anything
could
gathered
from
this
quarter
the
mews
were
active
the
piccadilly
houses
being
mostly
occupation
asked
one
two
the
grooms
and
helpers
whom
saw
around
they
could
tell
anything
about
the
empty
house
one
them
said
that
heard
had
lately
been
taken
but
couldn
say
from
whom
told
however
that
very
lately
there
had
been
notice
board
for
sale
and
that
perhaps
mitchell
sons
candy
the
house
agents
could
tell
something
thought
remembered
seeing
the
name
that
firm
the
board
did
not
wish
seem
too
eager
let
informant
know
guess
too
much
thanking
him
the
usual
manner
strolled
away
was
now
growing
dusk
and
the
autumn
night
was
closing
did
not
lose
any
time
having
learned
the
address
mitchell
sons
candy
from
directory
the
berkeley
was
soon
their
office
sackville
street
the
gentleman
who
saw
was
particularly
suave
manner
but
uncommunicative
equal
proportion
having
once
told
that
the
piccadilly
house
which
throughout
our
interview
called
mansion
was
sold
considered
business
concluded
when
asked
who
had
purchased
opened
his
eyes
thought
wider
and
paused
few
seconds
before
replying
sold
sir
pardon
said
with
equal
politeness
but
have
special
reason
for
wishing
know
who
purchased
again
paused
longer
and
raised
his
eyebrows
still
more
sold
sir
was
again
his
laconic
reply
surely
said
you
not
mind
letting
know
much
but
mind
answered
the
affairs
their
clients
are
absolutely
safe
the
hands
mitchell
sons
candy
this
was
manifestly
prig
the
first
water
and
there
was
use
arguing
with
him
thought
had
best
meet
him
his
own
ground
said
your
clients

happy
having
resolute
guardian
their
confidence

thanked
him
gave
the

seward
and
came
away

dark
and
was
tired
and
hungry
got
cup
tea
the
aërated
bread
company
and
came
down
purfleet
the
next
train
found
all
the
others
home
mina
was
looking
tired
and
pale
but
she
made
gallant
effort
bright
and
cheerful
wrung
heart
think
that
had
had
keep
anything
from
her
and
caused
her
inquietude
thank
god
this
will
the
last
night
her
looking
our
conferences
and
feeling
the
sting
our
not
showing
our
confidence
took
all
courage
hold
the
wise
resolution
keeping
her
out
our
grim
task
she
seems
somehow
more
reconciled
else
the
very
subject
seems
have
become
repugnant
her
for
when
any
accidental
allusion
made
she
actually
shudders
glad
made
our
resolution
time
with
such
feeling
this
our
growing
knowledge
would
torture
her
could
not
tell
the
others
the
day
discovery
till
were
alone
after
dinner
followed
little
music
save
appearances
even
amongst
ourselves
took
mina
her
room
and
left
her
bed
the
dear
girl
was
more
affectionate
with
than
ever
and
clung
though
she
would
detain
but
there
was
much
talked
and
came
away
thank
god
the
ceasing
telling
things
has
made
difference
between
when
came
down
again
found
the
others
all
gathered
round
the
fire
the
study
the
train
had
written
diary
far
and
simply
read
off
them
the
best
means
letting
them
get
abreast
own
information
when
had
finished
van
helsing
said
this
has
been
great

search
until

them
then
shall
make
our
final
coup
and
hunt
the
wretch
his
real
death
all
sat
silent
awhile
and
all
once
morris
spoke
say
how
are
going
get
into
that
house
got
into
the
other
answered
lord
godalming
quickly
but

different

some
sort
perhaps
shall
know
when
you
get
his
letter
the
morning
lord
godalming
brows
contracted
and
stood
and
walked
about
the
room
and
stopped
and
said
turning
from
one
another
quincey
head
level
this
burglary
business
getting
serious
got
off
once
all
right
but
have
now
rare
job
hand
unless
can
find
the
count
key
basket
nothing
could
well
done
before
morning
and
would
least
advisable
wait
till
lord
godalming
should
hear
from
mitchell
decided
not
take
any
active
step
before
breakfast
time
for
good
while
sat
and
smoked
discussing
the
matter
its
various
lights
and
bearings
took
the
opportunity
bringing
this
diary
right
the
moment
very
sleepy
and
shall
bed
just
line
mina
sleeps
soundly
and
her
breathing
regular
her
forehead
puckered
into
little
wrinkles
though
she
thinks
even
her
sleep
she
still
too
pale
but
does
not
look
haggard
she
did
this
morning
morrow
will
hope
mend
all
this
she
will
herself
home
exeter
but
sleepy
seward
diary
october
puzzled
afresh
about
renfield
his
moods
change
rapidly
that
find
difficult
keep
touch
them
and
they
always
mean
something
more
than
his
own
well
being
they
form
more
than
interesting
study
this
morning
when
went
see
him
after
his
repulse
van
helsing
his
manner
was
that
man
commanding
destiny
was
fact
commanding
destiny
subjectively
did
not
really
care
for
any
the
things
mere
earth
was
the
clouds
and
looked
down
all
the
weaknesses
and
wants
poor
mortals
thought
would
improve
the
occasion
and
learn
something
asked
him
what
about
the
flies
these
times
smiled
quite
superior
sort
way
such
smile
would
have
become
the
face
malvolio
answered
the
fly
dear
sir
has
one
striking
feature
its
wings
are
typical
the
aërial
powers
the
psychic
faculties
the
ancients
did
well
when
they
typified
the
soul
butterfly
thought
would
push
his
analogy
its
utmost
logically
said
quickly
soul
you
are
after
now
his
madness
foiled
his
reason
and
puzzled
look
spread
over
his
face
shaking
his
head
with
decision
which
had
but
seldom
seen
him
said
want
souls
life
all
want
here
brightened
pretty
indifferent
about
present
life
all
right
have
all
want
you
must
get
new
patient
doctor
you
wish
study
zoöphagy
this
puzzled
little
drew
him
then
you
command
life
you
are
god
suppose
smiled
with
ineffably
benign
superiority
far
from
arrogate
myself
the
attributes
the
deity
not
even
concerned
his
especially
spiritual
doings
may
state
intellectual
position
far
concerns
things
purely
terrestrial
somewhat
the
position
which
enoch
occupied
spiritually
this
was
poser
could
not
the
moment
recall
enoch
appositeness
had
ask
simple
question
though
felt
that
doing
was
lowering
myself
the
eyes
the
lunatic
and
why
with
enoch
because
walked
with
god
could
not
see
the
analogy
but
did
not
like
admit
harked
back
what
had
denied
you
don
care
about
life
and
you
don
want
souls
why
not
put
question
quickly
and
somewhat
sternly
purpose
disconcert
him
the
effort
succeeded
for
instant
unconsciously
relapsed
into
his
old
servile
manner
bent
low
before
and
actually
fawned
upon
replied
don
want
any
souls
indeed
indeed
don
couldn
use
them
had
them
they
would
manner
use
couldn
eat
them
suddenly
stopped
and
the
old
cunning
look
spread
over
his
face
like
wind
sweep
the
surface
the
water
and
doctor
life
what
after
all
when
you
got
all
you
require
and
you
know
that
you
will
never
want
that
all
have
friends
good
friends
like
you
seward
this
was
said
with
leer
inexpressible
cunning
know
that
shall
never
lack
the
means
life
think
that
through
the
cloudiness
his
insanity
saw
some
antagonism
for
once
fell
back
the
last
refuge
such
dogged
silence
after
short
time
saw
that
for
the
present
was
useless
speak
him
was
sulky
and
came
away
later
the
day
sent
for
ordinarily
would
not
have
come
without
special
reason
but
just
present
interested
him
that
would
gladly
make
effort
besides
glad
have
anything
help
pass
the
time
harker
out
following
clues
and
are
lord
godalming
and
quincey
van
helsing
sits
study
poring
over
the
record
prepared
the
harkers
seems
think
that
accurate
knowledge
all
details
will
light
upon
some
clue
does
not
wish
disturbed
the
work
without
cause
would
have
taken
him
with
see
the
patient
only
thought
that
after
his
last
repulse
might
not
care
again
there
was
also
another
reason
renfield
might
not
speak
freely
before
third
person
when
and
were
alone
found
him
sitting
out
the
middle
the
floor
his
stool
pose
which
generally
indicative
some
mental
energy
his
part
when
came
said
once
though
the
question
had
been
waiting
his
lips
what
about
souls
was
evident
then
that
surmise
had
been
correct
unconscious
cerebration
was
doing
its
work
even
with
the
lunatic
determined
have
the
matter
out
what
about
them
yourself
asked
did
not
reply
for
moment
but
looked
all
round
him
and
and
down
though
expected
find
some
inspiration
for
answer
don
want
any
souls
said
feeble
apologetic
way
the
matter
seemed
preying
his
mind
and
determined
use
cruel
only
kind
said
you
like
life
and
you
want
life
yes
but
that
all
right
you
needn
worry
about
that
but
asked
how
are
get
the
life
without
getting
the
soul
also
this
seemed
puzzle
him
followed
nice
time
you
have
some
time
when
you
flying
out
there
with
the
souls
thousands
flies
and
spiders
and
birds
and
cats
buzzing
and
twittering
and
miauing
all
round
you
you
got
their
lives
you
know
and
you
must
put
with
their
souls
something
seemed
affect
his
imagination
for
put
his
fingers
his
ears
and
shut
his
eyes
screwing
them
tightly
just
small
boy
does
when
his
face
being
soaped
there
was
something
pathetic
that
touched
also
gave
lesson
for
seemed
that
before
was
child
only
child
though
the
features
were
worn
and
the
stubble
the
jaws
was
white
was
evident
that
was
undergoing
some
process
mental
disturbance
and
knowing
how
his
past
moods
had
interpreted
things
seemingly
foreign
himself
thought
would
enter
into
his
mind
well
could
and
with
him
the
first
step
was
restore
confidence
asked
him
speaking
pretty
loud
that
would
hear
through
his
closed
ears
would
you
like
some
sugar
get
your
flies
round
again
seemed
wake
all
once
and
shook
his
head
with
laugh
replied
not
much
flies
are
poor
things
after
all
after
pause
added
but
don
want
their
souls
buzzing
round
all
the
same
spiders
went
blow

what
the
use

there
isn
anything

stopped
suddenly
though
reminded
forbidden
topic
thought
myself
this
the
second
time
has
suddenly
stopped
the
word

what
does

renfield
seemed
himself
aware
having
made
lapse

all
said
for

moments
sat
despondently
suddenly
jumped
his
feet
with
his
eyes
blazing
and
all
the
signs
intense
cerebral
excitement
hell
with
you
and
your

shouted
why

had
evidently

when
the
attendants
came
told
them
not

and
they
withdrew
renfield
watched
them
when
the
door
was
closed
said
with
considerable
dignity
and
sweetness
seward
you
have
been
very
considerate
towards
believe
that
very
very
grateful
you
thought
well
leave

and
came
away
there
certainly

over

there
some

afoot
later
went
after

told
him
suspicion
grew
very
grave
and
after
thinking
the
matter
over
for
while
asked

came
the

heard
the
lunatic
within
singing

something
about

seemingly

for

that

yell
seemed
come
from
his
room
the
attendant
came
bursting
into
room
and
told
that
renfield
had
somehow
met
with
some
accident
had
heard
him
yell
and
when
went
him
found
him
lying
his
face
the
floor
all
covered
with
blood

let
put
down
with
exactness
all
that
happened
well
can
remember
since
last
made
entry
not
detail
that
can
recall
must
forgotten
all
calmness
must
proceed
when
came
renfield
room
found
him
lying
the
floor
his
left
side
glittering
pool
blood
when
went
move
him
became
once
apparent
that
had
received
some
terrible
injuries
there
seemed
none
that
unity
purpose
between
the
parts
the
body
which
marks
even
lethargic
sanity
the
face
was
exposed
could
see
that
was
horribly
bruised
though
had
been
beaten
against
the
floor
indeed
was
from
the
face
wounds
that
the
pool
blood
originated
the
attendant
who
was
kneeling
beside
the
body
said
turned
him
over
think
sir
his
back
broken
see
both
his
right
arm
and
leg
and
the
whole
side
his
face
are
paralysed
how
such
thing
could
have
happened
puzzled
the
attendant
beyond
measure
seemed
quite
bewildered
and
his
brows
were
gathered
said
can
understand
the
two
things
could
mark
his
face
like
that
beating
his
own
head
the
floor
saw
young
woman
once
the
eversfield
asylum
before
anyone
could
lay
hands
her
and
suppose
might
have
broke
his
neck
falling
out
bed
got
awkward
kink
but
for
the
life
can
imagine
how
the
two
things
occurred
his
back
was
broke
couldn
beat
his
head
and
his
face
was
like
that
before
the
fall
out
bed
there
would
marks
said
him
van
helsing
and
ask
him
kindly
come
here
once
want
him
without
instant
delay
the
man
ran
off
and
within
few
minutes
the
professor
his
dressing
gown
and
slippers
appeared
when
saw
renfield
the
ground
looked
keenly
him
moment
and
then
turned
think
recognised
thought
eyes
for
said
very
quietly
manifestly
for
the
ears
the
attendant
sad
accident
will
need
very
careful
watching
and
much
attention
shall
stay
with
you
myself
but
shall
first
dress
myself
you
will
remain
shall
few
minutes
join
you
the
patient
was
now
breathing
stertorously
and
was
easy
see
that
had
suffered
some
terrible
injury
van
helsing
returned
with
extraordinary
celerity
bearing
with
him
surgical
case
had
evidently
been
thinking
and
had
his
mind
made
for
almost
before
looked
the
patient
whispered
send
the
attendant
away
must
alone
with
him
when
becomes
conscious
after
the
operation
said
think
that
will
now
simmons
have
done
all
that
can
present
you
had
better
your
round
and
van
helsing
will
operate
let
know
instantly
there
anything
unusual
anywhere
the
man
withdrew
and
went
into
strict
examination
the
patient
the
wounds
the
face
was
superficial
the
real
injury
was
depressed
fracture
the
skull
extending
right
through
the
motor
area
the
professor
thought
moment
and
said
must
reduce
the
pressure
and
get
back
normal
conditions
far
can
the
rapidity
the
suffusion
shows
the
terrible
nature
his
injury
the
whole
motor
area
seems
affected
the
suffusion
the
brain
will
increase
quickly
must
trephine
once
may
too
late
was
speaking
there
was
soft
tapping
the
door
went
over
and
opened
and
found
the
corridor
without
arthur
and
quincey
pajamas
and
slippers
the
former
spoke
heard
your
man
call
van
helsing
and
tell
him
accident
woke
quincey
rather
called
for
him
was
not
asleep
things
are
moving
too
quickly
and
too
strangely
for
sound
sleep
for
any
these
times
been
thinking
that
morrow
night
will
not
see
things
they
have
been
have
look
back
and
forward
little
more
than
have
done
may
come
nodded
and
held
the
door
open
till
they
had
entered
then
closed
again
when
quincey
saw
the
attitude
and
state
the
patient
and
noted
the
horrible
pool
the
floor
said
softly
god
what
has
happened
him
poor
poor
devil
told
him
briefly
and
added
that
expected
would
recover
consciousness
after
the
operation
for
short
time
all
events
went
once
and
sat
down
the
edge
the
bed
with
godalming
beside
him
all
watched
patience
shall
wait
said
van
helsing
just
long
enough
fix
the
best
spot
for
trephining
that
may
most
quickly
and
perfectly
remove
the
blood
clot
for
evident
that
the
hæmorrhage
increasing
the
minutes
during
which
waited
passed
with
fearful
slowness
had
horrible
sinking
heart
and
from
van
helsing
face
gathered
that
felt
some
fear
apprehension
what
was
come
dreaded
the
words
that
renfield
might
speak
was
positively
afraid
think
but
the
conviction
what
was
coming
was
have
read
men
who
have
heard
the
death
watch
the
poor
man
breathing
came
uncertain
gasps
each
instant
seemed
though
would
open
his
eyes
and
speak
but
then
would
follow
prolonged
stertorous
breath
and
would
relapse
into
more
fixed
insensibility
inured
was
sick
beds
and
death
this
suspense
grew
and
grew
upon
could
almost
hear
the
beating
own
heart
and
the
blood
surging
through
temples
sounded
like
blows
from
hammer
the
silence
finally
became
agonising
looked
companions
one
after
another
and
saw
from
their
flushed
faces
and
damp
brows
that
they
were
enduring
equal
torture
there
was
nervous
suspense
over
all
though
overhead
some
dread
bell
would
peal
out
powerfully
when
should
least
expect
last
there
came
time
when
was
evident
that
the
patient
was
sinking
fast
might
die
any
moment
looked
the
professor
and
caught
his
eyes
fixed
mine
his
face
was
sternly
set
spoke
there
time
lose
his
words
may
worth
many
lives
have
been
thinking
stood
here
may
there
soul
stake
shall
operate
just
above
the
ear
without
another
word
made
the
operation
for
few
moments
the
breathing
continued
stertorous
then
there
came
breath
prolonged
that
seemed
though
would
tear
open
his
chest
suddenly
his
eyes
opened
and
became
fixed
wild
helpless
stare
this
was
continued
for
few
moments
then
softened
into
glad
surprise
and
from
the
lips
came
sigh
relief
moved
convulsively
and
did
said
quiet
doctor
tell
them
take
off
the
strait
waistcoat
have
had
terrible
dream
and
has
left
weak
that
cannot
move
what
wrong
with
face
feels
all
swollen
and
smarts
dreadfully
tried
turn
his
head
but
even
with
the
effort
his
eyes
seemed
grow
glassy
again
gently
put
back
then
van
helsing
said
quiet
grave
tone
tell
your
dream
renfield
heard
the
voice
his
face
brightened
through
its
mutilation
and
said
that
van
helsing
how
good
you
here
give
some
water
lips
are
dry
and
shall
try
tell
you
dreamed
stopped
and
seemed
fainting
called
quietly
quincey
the
brandy
study
quick
flew
and
returned
with
glass
the
decanter
brandy
and
carafe
water
moistened
the
parched
lips
and
the
patient
quickly
revived
seemed
however
that
his
poor
injured
brain
had
been
working
the
interval
for
when
was
quite
conscious
looked
piercingly
with
agonised
confusion
which
shall
never
forget
and
said
must
not
deceive
myself
was
dream
but
all
grim
reality
then
his
eyes
roved
round
the
room
they
caught
sight
the
two
figures
sitting
patiently
the
edge
the
bed
went
were
not
sure
already
would
know
from
them
for
instant
his
eyes
closed
not
with
pain
sleep
but
voluntarily
though
were
bringing
all
his
faculties
bear
when
opened
them
said
hurriedly
and
with
more
energy
than
had
yet
displayed
quick
doctor
quick
dying
feel
that
have
but
few
minutes
and
then
must
back
death
worse
wet
lips
with
brandy
again
have
something
that
must
say
before
die
before
poor
crushed
brain
dies
anyhow
thank
you
was
that
night
after
you
left
when
implored
you
let
away
couldn
speak
then
for
felt
tongue
was
tied
but
was
sane
then
except
that
way
now
was
agony
despair
for
long
time
after
you
left
seemed
hours
then
there
came
sudden
peace
brain
seemed
become
cool
again
and
realised
where
was
heard
the
dogs
bark
behind
our
house
but
not
where
was
spoke
van
helsing
eyes
never
blinked
but
his
hand
came
out
and
met
mine
and
gripped
hard
did
not
however
betray
himself
nodded
slightly
and
said
low
voice
renfield
proceeded
came
the
window
the
mist
had
seen
him
often
before
but
was
solid
then
not
ghost
and
his
eyes
were
fierce
like
man
when
angry
was
laughing
with
his
red
mouth
the
sharp
white
teeth
glinted
the
moonlight
when
turned
look
back
over
the
belt
trees
where
the
dogs
were
barking
wouldn
ask
him
come
first
though
knew
wanted
just
had
wanted
all
along
then
began
promising
things
not
words
but
doing
them
was
interrupted
word
from
the
professor
how
making
them
happen
just
used
send
the
flies
when
the
sun
was
shining
great
big
fat
ones
with
steel
and
sapphire
their
wings
and
big
moths
the
night
with
skull
and
cross
bones
their
backs
van
helsing
nodded
him
whispered
unconsciously
the
acherontia
aitetropos
the
sphinges
what
you
call
the
death
head
moth
the
patient
went
without
stopping
then
began
whisper
rats
rats
rats
hundreds
thousands
millions
them
and
every
one
life
and
dogs
eat
them
and
cats
too
all
lives
all
red
blood
with
years
life
and
not
merely
buzzing
flies
laughed
him
for
wanted
see
what
could
then
the
dogs
howled
away
beyond
the
dark
trees
his
house
beckoned
the
window
got
and
looked
out
and
raised
his
hands
and
seemed
call
out
without
using
any
words
dark
mass
spread
over
the
grass
coming
like
the
shape
flame
fire
and
then
moved
the
mist
the
right
and
left
and
could
see
that
there
were
thousands
rats
with
their
eyes
blazing
red
like
his
only
smaller
held
his
hand
and
they
all
stopped
and
thought
seemed
saying
all
these
lives
will
give
you
and
many
more
and
greater
through
countless
ages
you
will
fall
down
and
worship
and
then
red
cloud
like
the
colour
blood
seemed
close
over
eyes
and
before
knew
what
was
doing
found
myself
opening
the
sash
and
saying
him
come
lord
and
master
the
rats
were
all
gone
but
slid
into
the
room
through
the
sash
though
was
only
open
inch
wide
just
the
moon
herself
has
often
come
through
the
tiniest
crack
and
has
stood
before
all
her
size
and
splendour
his
voice
was
weaker
moistened
his
lips
with
the
brandy
again
and
continued
but
seemed
though
his
memory
had
gone
working
the
interval
for
his
story
was
further
advanced
was
about
call
him
back
the
point
but
van
helsing
whispered
let
him
not
interrupt
him
cannot
back
and
maybe
could
not
proceed
all
once
lost
the
thread
his
thought
proceeded
all
day
waited
hear
from
him
but
did
not
send
anything
not
even
blow
fly
and
when
the
moon
got
was
pretty
angry
with
him
when
slid
through
the
window
though
was
shut
and
did
not
even
knock
got
mad
with
him
sneered
and
his
white
face
looked
out
the
mist
with
his
red
eyes
gleaming
and
went
though
owned
the
whole
place
and
was
one
didn
even
smell
the
same
went
couldn
hold
him
thought
that
somehow
mrs
harker
had
come
into
the
room
the
two
men
sitting
the
bed
stood
and
came
over
standing
behind
him
that
could
not
see
them
but
where
they
could
hear
better
they
were
both
silent
but
the
professor
started
and
quivered
his
face
however
grew
grimmer
and
sterner
still
renfield
went
without
noticing
when
mrs
harker
came
see
this
afternoon
she
wasn
the
same
was
like
tea
after
the
teapot
had
been
watered
here
all
moved
but
one
said
word
went
didn
know
that
she
was
here
till
she
spoke
and
she
didn
look

same
don

for
the
pale
people
like
them
with
lots

them
and
hers
had
all
seemed
have
run
out
didn
think
the
time
but
when
she
went
away
began
think
and
made
mad
know
that
had
been
taking
the
life
out
her
could
feel
that
the
rest
quivered

but
remained
otherwise
still
when
came

ready
for

the
mist
stealing
and
grabbed
tight
had
heard
that

mean

life
till
saw
his
eyes
they
burned
into
and
strength
became
like
water
slipped
through
and
when
tried
cling
him
raised
and
flung
down
there
was
red
cloud
before
and
noise
like
thunder
and
the
mist
seemed
steal
away
under
the
door
his
voice
was
becoming
fainter
and
his
breath
more
stertorous
van
helsing
stood
instinctively

took
from

the
same
things
that

professor
had
his
ready
and
met

his
voice
was
breaking
and
not

rage
terror
predominated
own
heart
outside
the
harkers

but
the
door
did
not
yield
threw
ourselves
against
with
crash
burst
open
and
almost
fell
headlong
into
the
room
the
professor
did
actually
fall
and
saw
across
him
gathered
himself
from
hands
and
knees
what
saw
appalled
felt
hair
rise
like
bristles
the
back
neck
and
heart
seemed
stand
still
the
moonlight
was
bright
that
through
the
thick
yellow
blind
the
room
was
light
enough
see
the
bed
beside
the
window
lay
jonathan
harker
his
face
flushed
and
breathing
heavily
though
stupor
kneeling
the
near
edge
the
bed
facing
outwards
was
the
white
clad
figure
his
wife
her
side
stood
tall
thin
man
clad
black
his
face
was
turned
from
but
the
instant
saw
all
recognised
the
count
every
way
even
the
scar
his
forehead
with
his
left
hand
held
both
mrs
harker
hands
keeping
them
away
with
her
arms
full
tension
his
right
hand
gripped
her
the
back
the
neck
forcing
her
face
down
his
bosom
her
white
nightdress
was
smeared
with
blood
and
thin
stream
trickled
down
the
man
bare
breast
which
was
shown
his
torn
open
dress
the
attitude
the
two
had
terrible
resemblance
child
forcing
kitten
nose
into
saucer
milk
compel
drink
burst
into
the
room
the
count
turned
his
face
and
the
hellish
look
that
had
heard
described
seemed
leap
into
his
eyes
flamed
red
with
devilish
passion
the
great
nostrils
the
white
aquiline
nose
opened
wide
and
quivered
the
edge
and
the
white
sharp
teeth
behind
the
full
lips
the
blood
dripping
mouth
champed
together
like
those
wild
beast
with
wrench
which
threw
his
victim
back
upon
the
bed
though
hurled
from
height
turned
and
sprang
but
this
time
the
professor
had
gained
his
feet
and
was
holding
towards
him
the
envelope
which
contained
the
sacred
wafer
the
count
suddenly
stopped
just
poor
lucy
had
done
outside
the
tomb
and
cowered
back
further
and
further
back
cowered
lifting
our
crucifixes
advanced
the
moonlight
suddenly
failed
great
black
cloud
sailed
across
the
sky
and
when
the
gaslight
sprang
under
quincey
match
saw
nothing
but
faint
vapour
this
looked
trailed
under
the
door
which
with
the
recoil
from
its
bursting
open
had
swung
back
its
old
position
van
helsing
art
and
moved
forward
mrs
harker
who
this
time
had
drawn
her
breath
and
with
had
given
scream
wild
ear
piercing
despairing
that
seems
now
that
will
ring
ears
till
dying
day
for
few
seconds
she
lay
her
helpless
attitude
and
disarray
her
face
was
ghastly
with
pallor
which
was
accentuated
the
blood
which
smeared
her
lips
and
cheeks
and
chin
from
her
throat
trickled
thin
stream
blood
her
eyes
were
mad
with
terror
then
she
put
before
her
face
her
poor
crushed
hands
which
bore
their
whiteness
the
red
mark
the
count
terrible
grip
and
from
behind
them
came
low
desolate
wail
which
made
the
terrible
scream
seem
only
the
quick
expression
endless
grief
van
helsing
stepped
forward
and
drew
the
coverlet
gently
over
her
body
whilst
art
after
looking
her
face
for
instant
despairingly
ran
out
the
room

whispered

face
there

for
few
seconds
and
then
full
consciousness
seemed

upon

all
once
and
started

aroused

quick
movement
and
turned
him
with
her
arms

she
drew
them
again
and
putting
her

she
pulled
him
down
sitting

side
and
clung
him
fiercely
van

and
tried

them
both
the
professor
held
his
little
golden
crucifix
and
said
with
wonderful
calmness

together
she
shuddered
and
was
silent
holding
down
her
head
her
husband
breast
when
she
raised
his
white
night
robe
was
stained
with
blood
where
her
lips
had
touched
and
where
the
thin
open
wound
her
neck
had
sent
forth
drops
the
instant
she
saw
she
drew
back
with
low
wail
and
whispered
amidst
choking
sobs

between
put
out
his
arms
and
folded
her
his
breast
and
for
while
she
lay
there
sobbing
looked
over
her
bowed
head
with
eyes
that
blinked
damply
above
his
quivering
nostrils
his
mouth
was
set
steel
after
while
her
sobs
became
less
frequent
and
more
faint
and
then
said
speaking
with
studied
calmness
which
felt
tried
his
nervous
power
the
utmost
and
now
seward
tell
all
about
too
well
know
the
broad
fact
tell
all
that
has
been
told
him
exactly
what
had
happened
and
listened
with
seeming
impassiveness
but
his
nostrils
twitched
and
his
eyes
blazed
told
how
the
ruthless
hands
the
count
had
held
his
wife
that
terrible
and
horrid
position
with
her
mouth
the
open
wound
his
breast
interested
even
that
moment

that
whilst
the
face

convulsively
over
the
bowed
head

and

have
been
for
few
seconds
made
rare
hay
the
place
all
the
manuscript
had
been
burned
and
the
blue
flames
were
flickering
amongst
the
white
ashes
the
cylinders
your
phonograph
too
were
thrown
the
fire
and
the
wax
had
helped
the
flames
here

looked
into
renfield
room
but
there
was
trace
there
except
again
paused
said
harker
hoarsely
bowed
his
head
and
moistening
his
lips
with
his
tongue
added
except
that
the
poor
fellow
dead
mrs
harker
raised
her
head
looking
from
one
the
other
she
said
solemnly
god
will
done
could
not
but
feel
that
art
was
keeping
back
something
but
took
that
was
with
purpose
said

van

turned

and
asked

possible
where

the
house

not
see
him
but
saw
bat

from
renfield

and
flap
westward
expected

some
shape
back

but
evidently
sought
some
other
lair
will
not
back
night
for
the
sky
reddening
the
east
and
the
dawn
close
must
work
morrow
said
the
latter
words
through
his
shut
teeth
for
space
perhaps
couple
minutes
there
was
silence
and
could
fancy
that
could
hear
the
sound
our
hearts
beating
then
van
helsing
said
placing
his
hand
very
tenderly
mrs
harker
head
and
now
madam

quick
and
sharp
and
deadly
earnest
the
day
close
that
must
end
all
may
and
now
the
chance
that
may
live
and
learn
the
poor
dear
lady
shivered
and
could
see
the
tension
her
nerves
she
clasped
her
husband
closer
her
and
bent
her
head
lower
and
lower
still
his
breast
then
she
raised
her
head
proudly
and
held
out
one
hand
van
helsing
who
took
his
and
after
stooping
and
kissing
reverently
held
fast
the
other
hand
was
locked
that
her
husband
who
held
his
other
arm
thrown
round
her
protectingly
after
pause
which
she
was
evidently
ordering
her
thoughts
she
began
took
the
sleeping
draught
which
you
had
kindly
given
but
for
long
time
did
not
act
seemed
become
more
wakeful
and
myriads
horrible
fancies
began
crowd
upon
mind
all
them
connected
with
death
and
vampires
with
blood
and
pain
and
trouble
her
husband
involuntarily
groaned
she
turned
him
and
said
lovingly
not
fret
dear
you
must
brave
and
strong
and
help
through
the
horrible
task
you
only
knew
what
effort
tell
this
fearful
thing
all
you
would
understand
how
much
need
your
help
well
saw
must
try
help
the
medicine
its
work
with
will
was
any
good
resolutely
set
myself
sleep
sure
enough
sleep
must
soon
have
come
for
remember
more
jonathan
coming
had
not
waked
for
lay
side
when
next
remember
there
was
the
room
the
same
thin
white
mist
that
had
before
noticed
but
forget
now
you
know
this
you
will
find
diary
which
shall
show
you
later
felt
the
same
vague
terror
which
had
come
before
and
the
same
sense
some
presence
turned
wake
jonathan
but
found
that
slept
soundly
that
seemed
was
who
had
taken
the
sleeping
draught
and
not
tried
but
could
not
wake
him
this
caused
great
fear
and
looked
around
terrified
then
indeed
heart
sank
within
beside
the
bed
had
stepped
out
the
mist
rather
the
mist
had
turned
into
his
figure
for
had
entirely
disappeared
stood
tall
thin
man
all
black
knew
him
once
from
the
description
the
others
the
waxen
face
the
high
aquiline
nose
which
the
light
fell
thin
white
line
the
parted
red
lips
with
the
sharp
white
teeth
showing
between
and
the
red
eyes
that
had
seemed
see
the
sunset
the
windows
mary
church
whitby
knew
too
the
red
scar
his
forehead
where
jonathan
had
struck
him
for
instant
heart
stood
still
and
would
have
screamed
out
only
that
was
paralysed
the
pause
spoke
sort
keen
cutting
whisper
pointing
spoke
jonathan
silence
you
make
sound
shall
take
him
and
dash
his
brains
out
before
your
very
eyes
was
appalled
and
was
too
bewildered
say
anything
with
mocking
smile
placed
one
hand
upon
shoulder
and
holding
tight
bared
throat
with
the
other
saying
did
first
little
refreshment
reward
exertions
you
may
well
quiet
not
the
first
time
the
second
that
your
veins
have
appeased
thirst
was
bewildered
and
strangely
enough
did
not
want
hinder
him
suppose
part
the
horrible
curse
that
such
when
his
touch
his
victim
and
god
god
pity
placed
his
reeking
lips
upon
throat
her
husband
groaned
again
she
clasped
his
hand
harder
and
looked
him
pityingly
were
the
injured
one
and
went
felt
strength
fading
away
and
was
half
swoon
how
long
this
horrible
thing
lasted
know
not
but
seemed
that
long
time
must
have
passed
before
took
his
foul
awful
sneering
mouth
away
saw
drip
with
the
fresh
blood
the
remembrance
seemed
for
while
overpower
her
and
she
drooped
and
would
have
sunk
down
but
for
her
husband
sustaining
arm
with
great
effort
she
recovered
herself
and
went
then
spoke
mockingly
and
you
like
the
others
would
play
your
brains
against
mine
you
would
help
these
men
hunt
and
frustrate
designs
you
know
now
and
they
know
part
already
and
will
know
full
before
long
what
cross
path
they
should
have
kept
their
energies
for
use
closer
home
whilst
they
played
wits
against
against
who
commanded
nations
and
intrigued
for
them
and
fought
for
them
hundreds
years
before
they
were

that
end
this
with
that
pulled
open
his
shirt
and
with
his
long
sharp
nails
opened
vein
his
breast
when
the
blood
began
spurt
out
took
hands
one
his

them
tight
and
with
the

them
from

she
was
telling
her
terrible
story
the
eastern
sky
began
quicken
and
everything
became
more
and
more
clear
harker
was
still
and
quiet
but
over
his
face
the
awful
narrative
went
came
grey
look
which
deepened
and
deepened
the

when
the

when
van
helsing
and
seward
had
come
back
from
seeing
poor
renfield
went
gravely
into
what
was
done
first
seward
told
that
when
and
van
helsing
had
gone
down
the
room
below
they
had
found
renfield
lying
the
floor
all
heap
his
face
was
all
bruised
and
crushed
and
the
bones
the
neck
were
broken
seward
asked
the
attendant
who
was
duty
the
passage
had
heard
anything
said
that
had
been
sitting
down
confessed
half
dozing
when
heard
loud
voices
the
room
and
then
renfield
had
called
out
loudly
several
times
god
god
god
after
that
there
was
sound
falling
and
when
entered
the
room
found
him
lying
the
floor
face
down
just
the
doctors
had
seen
him
van
helsing
asked
had
heard
voices
voice
and
said
could
not
say
that
first
had
seemed
him
there
were
two
but
there
was
one
the
room
could
have
been
only
one
could
swear
required
that
the
word
god
was
spoken
the
patient
seward
said
when
were
alone
that
did
not
wish
into
the
matter
the
question
inquest
had
considered
and
would
never
put
forward
the
truth
one
would
believe
was
thought
that
the
attendant
evidence
could
give
certificate
death
misadventure
falling
from
bed
case
the
coroner
should
demand
there
would
formal
inquest
necessarily
the
same
result
when
the
question
began
discussed
what
should
our
next
step
the
very
first
thing
decided
was
that
mina
should
full
confidence
that
nothing
any
sort
matter
how
painful
should
kept
from
her
she
herself
agreed
its
wisdom
and
was
pitiful
see
her
brave
and
yet
sorrowful
and
such
depth
despair
there
must
concealment
she
said
alas
have
had
too
much
already
and
besides
there
nothing
all
the
world
that
can
give
more
pain
than
have
already
endured
than
suffer
now
whatever
may
happen
must
new
hope
new
courage
van
helsing
was
looking
her
fixedly
she
spoke
and
said
suddenly
but
quietly
but
dear
madam
mina
are
you
not
afraid
not
for
yourself
but
for
others
from
yourself
after
what
has
happened
her
face
grew
set
its
lines
but
her
eyes
shone
with
the
devotion
martyr
she
answered
for
mind
made
what
asked
gently
whilst
were
all
very
still
for
each
our
own
way
had
sort
vague
idea
what
she
meant
her
answer
came
with
direct
simplicity
though
she
were
simply
stating
fact
because
find
myself
and
shall
watch
keenly
for
sign
harm
any
that
love
shall
die
you
would
not
kill
yourself
asked
hoarsely
would
there
were
friend
who
loved
who
would
save
such
pain
and
desperate
effort
she
looked
him
meaningly
she
spoke
was
sitting
down
but
now
rose
and
came
close
her
and
put
his
hand
her
head
said
solemnly
child
there
such
one
were
for
your
good
for
myself
could
hold
account
with
god
find
such
euthanasia
for
you
even
this
moment
were
best
nay
were
safe
but
child
for
moment
seemed
choked
and
great
sob
rose
his
throat
gulped
down
and
went
there
are
here
some
who
would
stand
between
you
and
death
you
must
not
die
you
must
not
die
any
hand
but
least
all
your
own
until
the
other
who
has
fouled
your
sweet
life
true
dead
you
must
not
die
for
still
with
the
quick
dead
your
death
would
make
you
even
you
must
live
you
must
struggle
and
strive
live
though
death
would
seem
boon
unspeakable
you
must
fight
death
himself
though
come
you
pain
joy
the
day
the
night
safety
peril
your
living
soul
charge
you
that
you
not
die
nay
nor
think
death
till
this
great
evil
past
the
poor
dear
grew
white
death
and
shock
and
shivered
have
seen
quicksand
shake
and
shiver
the
incoming
the
tide
were
all
silent
could
nothing
length
she
grew
more
calm
and
turning
him
said
sweetly
but
sorrowfully
she
held
out
her
hand
promise
you
dear
friend
that
god
will
let
live
shall
strive
till
may
his
good
time
this
horror
may
have
passed
away
from
she
was
good
and
brave
that
all
felt
that
our
hearts
were
strengthened
work
and
endure
for
her
and
began
discuss
what
were
told
her
that
she
was
have
all
the
papers
the
safe
and
all
the
papers
diaries
and
phonographs
might
hereafter
use
and
was
keep
the
record
she
had
done
before
she
was
pleased
with
the
prospect
anything
pleased
could
used
connection
with
grim
interest
usual
van
helsing
had
thought
ahead
everyone
else
and
was
prepared
with
exact
ordering
our
work
perhaps
well
said
that
our
meeting
after
our
visit
carfax
decided
not
anything
with
the
earth
boxes
that
lay
there
had
done
the
count
must
have
guessed
our
purpose
and
would
doubtless
have
taken
measures
advance
frustrate
such
effort
with
regard
the
others
but
now
does
not
know
our
intentions
nay
more
all
probability
does
not
know
that
such
power
exists
can
sterilise
his
lairs
that
cannot
use
them
old
are
now
much
further
advanced
our
knowledge
their
disposition
that
when
have
examined
the
house
piccadilly
may
track
the
very
last
them
day
then
ours
and
rests
our
hope
the
sun
that
rose
our
sorrow
this
morning
guards
its
course
until
sets
night
that
monster
must
retain
whatever
form
now
has
confined
within
the
limitations
his
earthly
envelope
cannot
melt
into
thin
air
nor
disappear
through
cracks
chinks
crannies
through
doorway
must
open
the
door
like
mortal
and
have
this
day
hunt
out
all
his
lairs
and
sterilise
them
shall
have
not
yet
catch
him
and
destroy
him
drive
him
bay
some
place
where
the
catching
and
the
destroying
shall
time
sure
here
started
for
could
not
contain
myself
the
thought
that
the
minutes
and
seconds
preciously
laden
with
mina
life
and
happiness
were
flying
from
since
whilst
talked
action
was
impossible
but
van
helsing
held
his
hand
warningly
nay
friend
jonathan
said
this
the
quickest
way
home
the
longest
way
your
proverb
say
shall
all
act
and
act
with
desperate
quick
when
the
time
has
come
but
think
all
probable
the
key
the
situation
that
house
piccadilly
the
count
may
have
many
houses
which
has
bought
them
will
have
deeds
purchase
keys
and
other
things
will
have
paper
that
write
will
have
his
book
cheques
there
are
many
belongings
that
must
have
somewhere
why
not
this
place
central
quiet
where
come
and
the
front
the
back
all
hour
when
the
very
vast
the
traffic
there
none
notice
shall
there
and
search
that
house
and
when
learn
what
holds
then
what
our
friend
arthur
call
his
phrases
hunt
stop
the
earths
and
run
down
our
old
fox
not
then
let
come
once
cried
are
wasting
the
precious
precious
time
the
professor
did
not
move
but
simply
said
and
how
are
get
into
that
house
piccadilly
any
way
cried
shall
break
need
and
your
police
where
will
they
and
what
will
they
say
was
staggered
but
knew
that
wished
delay
had
good
reason
for
said
quietly
could
don
wait
more
than
need
you
know
sure
what
torture
child
that
and
indeed
there
wish
add
your
anguish
but
just
think
what
can
until
all
the
world
movement
then
will
come
our
time
have
thought
and
thought
and
seems
that
the
simplest
way
the
best
all
now
wish
get
into
the
house
but
have
key
not
nodded
now
suppose
that
you
were
truth
the
owner
that
house
and
could
not
still
get
and
think
there
was
you
conscience
the
housebreaker
what
would
you
should
get
respectable
locksmith
and
set
him
work
pick
the
lock
for
and
your
police
they
would
interfere
would
they
not
not
they
knew
the
man
was
properly
employed
then
looked
keenly
spoke
all
that
doubt
the
conscience
the
employer
and
the
belief
your
policemen
whether
that
employer
has
good
conscience
bad
one
your
police
must
indeed
zealous
men
and
clever
clever
reading
the
heart
that
they
trouble
themselves
such
matter
friend
jonathan
you
take
the
lock
off
hundred
empty
house
this
your
london
any
city
the
world
and
you
such
things
are
rightly
done
and
the
time
such
things
are
rightly
done
one
will
interfere
have
read
gentleman
who
owned
fine
house
london
and
when
went
for
months
summer
switzerland
and
lock
his
house
some
burglar
came
and
broke
window
back
and
got
then
went
and
made
open
the
shutters
front
and
walk
out
and
through
the
door
before
the
very
eyes
the
police
then
have
auction
that
house
and
advertise
and
put
big
notice
and
when
the
day
come
sell
off
great
auctioneer
all
the
goods
that
other
man
who
own
them
then
builder
and
sell
him
that
house
making
agreement
that
pull
down
and
take
all
away
within
certain
time
and
your
police
and
other
authority
help
him
all
they
can
and
when
that
owner
come
back
from
his
holiday
switzerland
find
only
empty
hole
where
his
house
had
been
this
was
all
done
regle
and
our
work
shall
regle
too
shall
not
early
that
the
policemen
who
have
then
little
think
shall
deem
strange
but
shall
after
ten
clock
when
there
are
many
about
and
such
things
would
done
were
indeed
owners
the
house
could
not
but
see
how
right
was
and
the
terrible
despair
mina
face
became
relaxed
thought
there
was
hope
such
good
counsel
van
helsing
went
when
once
within
that
house
may
find
more
clues
any
rate
some
can
remain
there
whilst
the
rest
find
the
other
places
where
there
more
earth
boxes
bermondsey
and
mile
end
lord
godalming
stood
can
some
use
here
said
shall
wire
people
have
horses
and
carriages
where
they
will
most
convenient
look
here
old
fellow
said
morris
capital
idea
have
all
ready
case
want
horsebacking
but
don
you
think
that
one
your
snappy
carriages
with
its
heraldic
adornments
byway
walworth
mile
end
would
attract
too
much
attention
for
our
purposes
seems
that
ought
take
cabs
when
south
east
and
even
leave
them
somewhere
near
the
neighbourhood
are
going
friend
quincey
right
said
the
professor
his
head
what
you
call
plane
with
the
horizon
difficult
thing
that
and
not
want
peoples
watch
may
mina
took
growing
interest
everything
and
was
rejoiced
see
that
the
exigency
affairs
was
helping
her
forget
for
time
the
terrible
experience
the
night
she
was
very
very
pale
almost
ghastly
and
thin
that
her
lips
were
drawn
away
showing
her
teeth
somewhat
prominence
did
not
mention
this
last
lest
should
give
her
needless
pain
but
made
blood
run
cold
veins
think
what
had
occurred
with
poor
lucy
when
the
count
had
sucked
her
blood
yet
there
was
sign
the
teeth
growing
sharper
but
the
time
yet
was
short
and
there
was
time
for
fear
when
came
the
discussion
the
sequence
our
efforts
and
the
disposition
our
forces
there
were
new
sources
doubt
was
finally
agreed
that
before
starting
for
piccadilly
should
destroy
the
count
lair
close
hand
case
should
find
out
too
soon
should
thus
still
ahead
him
our
work
destruction
and
his
presence
his
purely
material
shape
and
his
weakest
might
give
some
new
clue
the
disposal
forces
was
suggested
the
professor
that
after
our
visit
carfax
should
all
enter
the
house
piccadilly
that
the
two
doctors
and
should
remain
there
whilst
lord
godalming
and
quincey
found
the
lairs
walworth
and
mile
end
and
destroyed
them
was
possible
not
likely
the
professor
urged
that
the
count
might
appear
piccadilly
during
the
day
and
that
might
able
cope
with
him
then
and
there
any
rate
might
able
follow
him
force
this
plan
strenuously
objected
and
far
going
was
concerned
for
said
that
intended
stay
and
protect
mina
thought
that
mind
was
made
the
subject
but
mina
would
not
listen
objection
she
said
that
there
might
some
law
matter
which
could
useful
that
amongst
the
count
papers
might
some
clue
which
could
understand
out
experience
transylvania
and
that
was
all
the
strength
could
muster
was
required
cope
with
the
count
extraordinary
power
had
give
for
mina
resolution
was
fixed
she
said
that
was
the
last
hope
for
her
that
should
all
work
together
for
she
said
have
fear
things
have
been
bad
they
can
and
whatever
may
happen
must
have
some
element

the

overmastered
her
and
she
put
her
hands
before

face
and
shuddered
whilst
she
moaned
van

had
not
intended

her
frightful
experience
had
simply
lost

her
and
her
part

mina
was
the
brightest
and
most
cheerful
when

and
said

and
there
was
fearful
scream
which
almost
froze
our
hearts
hear
had
placed
the
wafer
mina

had
seared
had
burned
into
the
flesh
though
had
been
piece
white
hot
metal
poor
darling
brain
had
told
her
the
significance
the
fact
quickly
her
nerves
received
the
pain
and
the
two
overwhelmed
her
that
her
overwrought
nature
had
its
voice
that
dreadful
scream
but
the
words
her
thought
came
quickly
the
echo
the
scream
had
not
ceased
ring
the
air
when
there
came
the
reaction
and
she
sank
her
knees
the
floor
agony
abasement
pulling
her
beautiful
hair
over
her
face
the
leper
old
his
mantle
she
wailed
out
unclean
unclean
even
the
almighty
shuns
polluted
flesh
must
bear
this
mark
shame
upon
forehead
until
the
judgment
day
they
all
paused
had
thrown
myself
beside
her
agony
helpless
grief
and
putting
arms
around
held
her
tight
for
few
minutes
our
sorrowful
hearts
beat
together
whilst
the
friends
around
turned
away
their
eyes
that
ran
tears
silently
then
van
helsing
turned
and
said
gravely
gravely
that
could
not
help
feeling
that
was
some
way
inspired
and
was
stating
things
outside
himself
may
that
you
may
have
bear
that
mark
till
god
himself
see
fit
most
surely
shall
the
judgment
day

our
cross
his
son
did
obedience
his
will
may
that

chosen
instruments
his
good
pleasure
and
that
ascend
his
bidding
that
other
through
stripes
and
shame
through
tears
and
blood
through
doubts
and
fears
and
all
that
makes
the
difference
between
god
and
man
there
was
hope
his
words
and
comfort
and
they
made
for
resignation
mina
and
both
felt
and
simultaneously
each
took
one
the
old
man
hands
and
bent
over
and
kissed
then
without
word
all
knelt
down
together
and
all
holding

swore
true

the
veil

from
the

way
loved
and
prayed
for

and
guidance

that
amongst
prosaic
surroundings
neglect
and
dust
and
decay
there
was
any
ground
for
such

the

which
much
our
hope
was
centred
looming
grim
and
silent
its
deserted
condition
amongst
its
more
lively
and
spruce
looking
neighbours
sat
down
bench
within
good
view
and
began
smoke
cigars
attract
little
attention

the
minutes
seemed

and

just
then
sauntered
along
the

the
place

vilely
said
the
latter
came
did
indeed
smell
vilely
like
the
old
chapel
carfax
and
with
our
previous
experience
was
plain
that
the
count
had
been
using
the
place
pretty
freely

keeping

the
old

was
evident
that
the
count
was
not
present
the
house
and
proceeded
search
for
any
his
effects
after
cursory
glance
the
rest
the
rooms
from
basement
attic
came
the
conclusion
that
the
dining
room
contained
any
effects

and
proceeded
minutely

terrible
long
whilst

for

the

tried
keep
our
minds
active
using
them
all
the

see
his
beneficent
purpose
the
side
glances
which
threw
from
time
time

the
poor

overwhelmed
misery

appalling

last
night
was

looking

with
strong
youthful
face
full
energy
and
with
dark

drawn
haggard
old
man
whose
white

matches
well
with
the
hollow
burning
eyes
and
grief

his

his
energy
still
intact
fact
like
living
flame
this
may
yet
his

for

tide
him
over
the
despairing
period
will
then
kind
way
wake
again
the
realities

poor
fellow
thought
own
trouble
was
bad
enough
but
his
the

knows
this
well
enough
and
doing
his
best
keep
his
mind
active
what
has
been
saying
was
under
the
circumstances
absorbing

well
can
remember
here
have
studied
over
and
over
again
since
they
came
into
hands
all
the
papers
relating
this
monster
and
the
more
have
studied
the
greater
seems
the
necessity
utterly
stamp
him
out
all
through
there
are
signs
his
advance
not

his
power

his

you

about
half
hour
after

received
mrs

telegram
there
came
quiet
resolute
knock
the
hall
door
was
just
ordinary
knock
such
given
hourly
thousands
gentlemen
but
made
the
professor
heart
and
mine
beat
loudly
looked
each
other
and
together
moved
out
into
the
hall
each
held
ready
use
our
various
armaments
the
spiritual
the
left
hand
the
mortal
the
right
van
helsing
pulled
back
the
latch
and
holding
the
door
half
open
stood
back
having
both
hands
ready
for
action
the
gladness
our
hearts
must
have
shown
upon
our
faces
when
the
step
close
the
door
saw
lord
godalming
and
quincey
morris
they
came
quickly
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
the
former
saying
they
moved
along
the
hall
all
right
found
both
places
six
boxes
each
and
destroyed
them
all
destroyed
asked
the
professor
for
him
were
silent
for
minute
and
then
quincey
said
there
nothing
but
wait
here
however
doesn
turn
five
clock
must
start
off
for
won
leave
mrs
harker
alone
after
sunset
will
here
before
long
now
said
van
helsing
who
had
been
consulting
his
pocket
book
nota
bene
madam
telegram
went
south
from
carfax
that
means
went
cross
the
river
and
could
only
slack
tide
which
should
something
before
one
clock
that
went
south
has
meaning
for
yet
only
suspicious
and
went
from
carfax
first
the
place
where
would
suspect
interference
least
you
must
have
been
bermondsey
only
short
time
before
him
that
not
here
already
shows
that
went
mile
end
next
this
took
him
some
time
for
would
then
have
carried
over
the
river
some
way
believe
friends
shall
not
have
long
wait
now
should
have
ready
some
plan
attack
that
may
throw
away
chance
hush
there
time
now
have
all
your
arms
ready
held
warning
hand
spoke
for
all
could
hear
key
softly
inserted
the
lock
the
hall
door
could
not
but
admire
even
such
moment
the
way
which
dominant
spirit
asserted
itself
all
our
hunting
parties
and
adventures
different
parts
the
world
quincey
morris
had
always
been
the
one
arrange
the
plan
action
and
arthur
and
had
been
accustomed
obey
him
implicitly
now
the
old
habit
seemed
renewed
instinctively
with
swift
glance
around
the
room
once
laid
out
our
plan
attack
and
without
speaking
word
with
gesture
placed
each
position
van
helsing
harker
and
were
just
behind
the
door
that
when
was
opened
the
professor
could
guard
whilst
two
stepped
between
the
incomer
and
the
door
godalming
behind
and
quincey
front
stood
just
out
sight
ready
move
front
the
window
waited
suspense
that
made
the
seconds
pass
with
nightmare
slowness
the
slow
careful
steps
came
along
the
hall
the
count
was
evidently
prepared
for
some
surprise
least
feared
suddenly
with
single
bound
leaped
into
the
room
winning
way
past
before
any
could
raise
hand
stay
him
there
was
something
panther
like
the
movement
something
unhuman
that
seemed
sober
all
from
the
shock
his
coming
the
first
act
was
harker
who
with
quick
movement
threw
himself
before
the
door
leading
into
the
room
the
front
the
house
the
count
saw
horrible
sort
snarl
passed
over
his
face
showing
the
eye
teeth
long
and
pointed
but
the
evil
smile
quickly
passed
into
cold
stare
lion
like
disdain
his
expression
again
changed
with
single
impulse
all
advanced
upon
him
was
pity
that
had
not
some
better
organised
plan
attack
for
even
the
moment
wondered
what
were
did
not
myself
know
whether
our
lethal
weapons
would
avail
anything
harker
evidently
meant
try
the
matter
for
had
ready
his
great
kukri
knife
and
made
fierce
and
sudden
cut
him
the
blow
was
powerful
one
only
the
diabolical
quickness
the
count
leap
back
saved
him
second
less
and
the
trenchant
blade
had
shorne
through
his
heart
was
the
point
just
cut
the
cloth
his
coat
making
wide
gap
whence
bundle
bank
notes
and
stream
gold
fell
out
the
expression
the
count
face
was
hellish
that
for
moment
feared
for
harker
though
saw
him
throw
the
terrible
knife
aloft
again
for
another
stroke
instinctively
moved
forward
with
protective
impulse
holding
the
crucifix
and
wafer
left
hand
felt
mighty
power
fly
along
arm
and
was
without
surprise
that
saw
the
monster
cower
back
before
similar
movement
made
spontaneously
each
one
would
impossible
describe
the
expression
hate
and
baffled
malignity
anger
and
hellish
rage
which
came
over
the
count
face
his
waxen
hue
became
greenish
yellow
the
contrast
his
burning
eyes
and
the
red
scar
the
forehead
showed
the
pallid
skin
like
palpitating
wound
the
next
instant
with
sinuous
dive
swept
under
harker
arm
ere
his
blow
could
fall
and
grasping
handful
the
money
from
the
floor
dashed
across
the
room
threw
himself
the
window
amid
the
crash
and
glitter
the
falling
glass
tumbled
into
the
flagged
area
below
through
the
sound
the
shivering
glass
could
hear
the
ting
the
gold
some
the
sovereigns
fell
the
flagging
ran
over
and
saw
him
spring
unhurt
from
the
ground
rushing
the
steps
crossed
the
flagged
yard
and
pushed
open
the
stable
door
there
turned
and
spoke
you
think
baffle
you
with
your
pale
faces
all
row
like
sheep
butcher
you
shall
sorry
yet
each
one

think
you
have
left
without

but
have
more
revenge

begun

over
centuries
and

your
girls
that
you

and
through
them

and
jackals
when
want

bah
with
contemptuous
sneer
passed
quickly
through
the
door
and
heard
the
rusty
bolt
creak
fastened
behind
him
door
beyond
opened
and
shut
the
first
speak
was
the
professor
realising
the
difficulty
following
him
through
the
stable
moved
toward
the
hall
have
learnt
something
much
notwithstanding
his
brave
words
fears
fear
time
fear
want
for
not
why
hurry
his
very
tone
betray
him
ears
deceive
why
take
that
money
you
follow
quick
you
are
hunters
wild
beast
and
understand
for
make
sure
that
nothing
here
may
use
him
that
return
spoke
put
the
money
remaining
into
his
pocket
took
the
title
deeds
the
bundle
harker
had
left
them
and
swept
the
remaining
things
into
the
open
fireplace
where
set
fire
them
with
match
godalming
and
morris
had
rushed
out
into
the
yard
and
harker
had
lowered
himself
from
the
window
follow
the
count
had
however
bolted
the
stable
door
and
the
time
they
had
forced
open
there
was
sign
him
van
helsing
and
tried
make
inquiry
the
back
the
house
but
the
mews
was
deserted
and
one
had
seen
him
depart
was
now
late
the
afternoon
and
sunset
was
not
far
off
had
recognise
that
our
game
was
with
heavy
hearts
agreed
with
the
professor
when
said
let
back
madam
mina
poor
poor
dear
madam
mina
all
can
just
now
done
and
can
there
least
protect
her
but
need
not
despair
there
but
one
more
earth
box
and
must
try
find
when
that
done
all
may
yet
well
could
see
that
spoke
bravely
could
comfort
harker
the
poor
fellow
was
quite
broken
down
now
and
again
gave
low
groan
which
could
not
suppress
was
thinking
his
wife
with
sad
hearts
came
back
house
where
found
mrs
harker
waiting
with
appearance
cheerfulness
which
did
honour
her
bravery
and
unselfishness
when
she
saw
our
faces
her
own
became
pale
death
for
second
two
her
eyes
were
closed
she
were
secret
prayer
and
then
she
said
cheerfully
can
never
thank
you
all
enough
poor
darling
she
spoke
she
took
her
husband
grey
head
her
hands
and
kissed
lay
your
poor
head
here
and
rest
all
will
yet
well
dear
god
will
protect
will
his
good
intent
the
poor
fellow
groaned
there
was
place
for
words
his
sublime
misery
had
sort
perfunctory
supper
together
and
think
cheered
all
somewhat
was
perhaps
the
mere
animal
heat
food
hungry
people
for
none
had
eaten
anything
since
breakfast
the
sense
companionship
may
have
helped
but
anyhow
were
all
less
miserable
and
saw
the
morrow
not
altogether
without
hope
true
our
promise
told
mrs
harker
everything
which
had
passed
and
although
she
grew
snowy
white
times
when
danger
had
seemed
threaten
her
husband
and
red
others
when
his
devotion
her
was
manifested
she
listened
bravely
and
with
calmness
when
came
the
part
where
harker
had
rushed
the
count
recklessly
she
clung
her
husband
arm
and
held
tight
though
her
clinging
could
protect
him
from
any
harm
that
might
come
she
said
nothing
however
till
the
narration
was
all
done
and
matters
had
been
brought
right
the
present
time
then
without
letting
her
husband
hand
she
stood
amongst
and
spoke
that
could
give
any
idea
the
scene
that
sweet
sweet
good
good
woman
all
the
radiant
beauty
her
youth
and
animation
with
the
red
scar
her
forehead
which
she
was
conscious
and
which
saw
with
grinding
our
teeth
remembering
whence
and
how
came
her
loving
kindness
against
our
grim
hate
her
tender
faith
against
all
our
fears
and
doubting
and
knowing
that
far
symbols
went
she
with
all
her
goodness
and
purity
and
faith
was
outcast
from
god
jonathan
she
said
and
the
word
sounded
like
music
her
lips
was
full
love
and
tenderness
jonathan
dear
and
you
all
true
true
friends
want
you
bear
something
mind
through
all
this
dreadful
time
know
that
you
must
fight
that
you
must
destroy
even
you
destroyed
the
false
lucy
that
the
true
lucy
might
live
hereafter
but
not
work
hate
that
poor
soul
who
has
wrought
all
this
misery
the
saddest
case
all
just
think
what
will
his
joy
when
too
destroyed
his
worser
part
that
his
better
part
may
have
spiritual
immortality
you
must
pitiful
him
too
though
may
not
hold
your
hands
from
his
destruction
she
spoke
could
see
her
husband
face
darken
and
draw
together
though
the
passion
him
were
shrivelling
his
being
its
core
instinctively
the
clasp
his
wife
hand
grew
closer
till
his
knuckles
looked
white
she
did
not
flinch
from
the
pain
which
knew
she
must
have
suffered
but
looked
him
with
eyes
that
were
more
appealing
than
ever
she
stopped
speaking
leaped
his
feet
almost
tearing
his
hand
from
hers
spoke
may
god
give
him
into
hand
just
for
long
enough
destroy
that
earthly
life
him
which
are
aiming
beyond
could
send
his
soul
for
ever
and
ever
burning
hell
would
hush
hush
the
name
the
good
god
don
say
such
things
jonathan
husband
you
will
crush
with
fear
and
horror
just
think
dear
have
been
thinking
all
this
long
long
day
that
perhaps
some
day
too
may
need
such
pity
and
that
some
other
like
you
and
with
equal
cause
for
anger
may
deny
husband
husband
indeed
would
have
spared
you
such
thought
had
there
been
another
way
but
pray
that
god
may
not
have
treasured
your
wild
words
except
the
heart
broken
wail
very
loving
and
sorely
stricken
man
god
let
these
poor
white
hairs
evidence
what
has
suffered
who
all
his
life
has
done
wrong
and
whom
many
sorrows
have
come
men
were
all
tears
now
there
was
resisting
them
and
wept
openly
she
wept
too
see
that
her
sweeter
counsels
had
prevailed
her
husband
flung
himself
his
knees
beside
her
and
putting
his
arms
round
her
hid
his
face
the
folds
her
dress
van
helsing
beckoned
and
stole
out
the
room
leaving
the
two
loving
hearts
alone
with
their
god
before
they
retired
the
professor
fixed
the
room
against
any
coming
the
vampire
and
assured
mrs
harker
that
she
might
rest
peace
she
tried
school
herself
the
belief
and
manifestly
for
her
husband
sake
tried
seem
content
was
brave
struggle
and
was
think
and
believe
not
without
its
reward

placed

either
them
was

they
had
retired

journal
october
close
midnight
thought
yesterday
would
never
end
there
was
over
yearning
for
sleep
some
sort
blind
belief
that
wake
would
find
things
changed
and
that
any
change
must
now
for
the
better
before
parted
discussed
what
our
next
step
was
but
could
arrive
result
all
knew
was
that
one
earth
box
remained
and
that
the
count
alone
knew
where
was
chooses
lie
hidden
may
baffle
for
years
and
the
meantime
the
thought
too
horrible
dare
not
think
even
now
this
know
that
ever
there
was
woman
who
was
all
perfection
that
one
poor
wronged
darling
love
her
thousand
times
more
for
her
sweet
pity
last
night
pity
that
made
own
hate
the
monster
seem
despicable
surely
god
will
not
permit
the
world
the
poorer
the
loss
such
creature
this

are
all
drifting
reefwards
now
and

and
sleeping
without

fear
what
her
dreams
might
like
with
such
terrible
memories
ground
them
she
has
not
been
calm
within
seeing
since
the
sunset
then
for
while
there
came
over
her
face
repose
which
was
like
spring
after
the
blasts
march
thought
the
time
that
was
the
softness
the
red
sunset
her
face
but
somehow
now
think
has
deeper
meaning
not
sleepy
myself
though
weary
weary
death
however

gazed
him
fixedly
for
few
minutes
during
which
own
heart
beat
like
trip
hammer
for
felt
that
some
crisis
was
hand
gradually
her
eyes
closed
and
she
sat
stock
still
only
the
gentle
heaving
her
bosom
could
one
know
that
she
was
alive
the
professor
made
few
more
passes
and
then
stopped
and
could
see
that
his
forehead
was
covered
with
great
beads
perspiration
mina
opened
her
eyes
but
she
did
not
seem
the
same
woman
there
was
far
away
look
her
eyes
and
her
voice
had
sad
dreaminess
which
was
new
raising
his
hand
impose
silence
the
professor
motioned
bring
the
others
they
came
tip
toe
closing
the
door
behind
them
and
stood
the
foot
the
bed
looking
mina
appeared
not
see
them
the
stillness
was
broken
van
helsing
voice
speaking
low
level
tone
which
would
not
break
the
current
her
thoughts
where
are
you
the
answer
came
neutral
way
not
know
sleep
has
place
can
call
its
own
for
several
minutes
there
was
silence
mina
sat
rigid
and
the
professor
stood
staring
her
fixedly
the
rest
hardly
dared
breathe
the
room
was
growing
lighter
without
taking
his
eyes
from
mina
face
van
helsing
motioned
pull
the
blind
did
and
the
day
seemed
just
upon
red
streak
shot
and
rosy
light
seemed
diffuse
itself
through
the
room
the
instant
the
professor
spoke
again
where
are
you
now
the
answer
came
dreamily
but
with
intention
were
though
she
were
interpreting
something
have
heard
her
use
the
same
tone
when
reading
her
shorthand
notes
not
know
all
strange
what
you
see
can
see
nothing
all
dark
what
you
hear
could
detect
the
strain
the
professor
patient
voice
the
lapping
water
gurgling
and
little
waves
leap
can
hear
them
the
outside
then
you
are
ship
all
looked
each
other
trying
glean
something
each
from
the
other
were
afraid
think
the
answer
came
quick
yes
what
else
you
hear
the
sound
men
stamping
overhead
they
run
about
there
the
creaking
chain
and
the
loud
tinkle
the
check
the
capstan
falls
into
the
rachet
what
are
you
doing
still
still
like
death
the
voice
faded
away
into
deep
breath
one
sleeping
and
the
open
eyes
closed
again
this
time
the
sun
had
risen
and
were
all
the
full
light
day
van
helsing
placed
his
hands
mina
shoulders
and
laid
her
head
down
softly
her
pillow
she
lay
like
sleeping
child
for
few
moments
and
then
with
long
sigh
awoke
and
stared
wonder
see
all
around
her
have
been
talking
sleep
was
all
she
said
she
seemed
however
know
the
situation
without
telling
though
she
was
eager
know
what
she
had
told
the
professor
repeated
the
conversation
and
she
said
then
there
not
moment

too
late

started
for
the
door
but
the

calm
voice
called
them

blood

also
and
after
asking
where
there
might
close
hand
ship
where
might
purchase
ship
forms
departed
one
knew
where
went
bloomin
well
cared
they
said
for
they
had
something
else
think
well
with
blood
again
for
soon
became
apparent
all
that
the
czarina
catherine
would
not
sail
was
expected
thin
mist
began
creep
from
the
river
and
grew
and
grew
till
soon
dense
fog
enveloped
the
ship
and
all
around
her
the
captain
swore
polyglot
very
polyglot
polyglot
with
bloom
and
blood
but
could
nothing
the
water
rose
and
rose
and
began
fear
that
would
lose
the
tide
altogether
was
friendly
mood
when
just
full
tide
the
thin
man
came
the
gang
plank
again
and
asked
see
where
his
box
had
been
stowed
then
the
captain
replied
that
wished
that
and
his
box
old
and
with
much
bloom
and
blood
were
hell
but
the
thin
man
did
not
offend
and
went
down
with
the
mate
and
saw
where
was
place
and
came
and
stood
awhile
deck
fog
must
have
come
off
himself
for
none
notice
him
indeed
they
thought
not
him
for
soon
the
fog
begin
melt
away
and
all
was
clear
again
friends
the
thirst
and
the
language
that
was
bloom
and
blood
laughed
they
told
how
the
captain
swears
exceeded
even
his
usual
polyglot
and
was
more
than
ever
full
picturesque
when
questioning
other
mariners
who
were
movement
and
down
the
river
that
hour
found
that
few
them
had
seen
any
fog
all
except
where
lay
round
the
wharf
however
the
ship
went
out
the
ebb
tide
and
was
doubtless
morning
far
down
the
river
mouth
she
was
then
when
they
told
well
out
sea
and
dear
madam
mina
that
have
rest
for
time
for
our
enemy
the
sea
with
the
fog
his
command
his
way

danube
mouth
sail
ship
takes
time
she
never
quick
and
when
start
land
more
quick
and
meet
him
there
our
best
hope
come
him
when
the
box
between
sunrise
and
sunset
for
then
can
make
struggle
and
may
deal
with
him
should
there
are
days
for
which
can
make
ready
our
plan
know
all
about
where
for
have
seen
the
owner
the
ship
who
have
shown
invoices
and
all
papers
that
can
the
box
seek
landed
varna
and
given
agent
one
ristics
who
will
there
present
his
credentials
and
our
merchant
friend
will
have
done
his
part
when
ask
there
any
wrong
for
that
can
telegraph
and
have
inquiry
made
varna
say
for
what
done
not
for

the
customs

and
our
own
way
when

more
angry
and
more
forceful
till
the

see
wherein
was

some
that
personal
dominance
which
made
him
long
master
amongst

him
with

one
all
the

there
have
been
volcanoes
some
whose
openings
still
send
out
waters
strange
properties
and
gases

general
discussion
was
determined
that
for
night
nothing
definitely
settled
that
should
all
sleep
the
facts
and
try
think
out
the
proper
conclusions

after
making
our
conclusions
known

decide
some
definite

removed
from

the
mirror
the

mark
upon

and
knew
that

still
unclean
seward
diary
october
all
rose
early
and
think
that
sleep
did
much
for
each
and
all
when
met
early
breakfast
there
was
more
general
cheerfulness
than
any
had
ever
expected
experience
again
really
wonderful
how
much
resilience
there
human
nature
let
any
obstructing
cause
matter
what
removed
any
way
even
death
and
fly
back
first
principles
hope
and
enjoyment
more
than
once
sat
around
the
table
eyes
opened
wonder
whether
the
whole
the
past
days
had
not
been
dream
was
only
when
caught
sight
the
red
blotch
mrs
harker
forehead
that
was
brought
back
reality
even
now
when
gravely
revolving
the
matter
almost
impossible
realise
that
the
cause
all
our
trouble
still
existent
even
mrs
harker
seems
lose
sight
her
trouble
for
whole
spells
only
now
and
again
when
something
recalls
her
mind
that
she
thinks
her
terrible
scar
are
meet
here
study
half
hour
and
decide
our
course
action
see
only
one
immediate
difficulty
know
instinct
rather
than
reason
shall
all
have
speak
frankly
and
yet
fear
that
some
mysterious
way
poor
mrs
harker
tongue
tied
know
that
she
forms
conclusions
her
own
and
from
all
that
has
been
can
guess
how
brilliant
and
how
true
they
must
but
she
will
not
cannot
give
them
utterance
have
mentioned
this
van
helsing
and
and
are
talk
over
when
are
alone
suppose
some
that
horrid
poison
which
has
got
into
her
veins
beginning
work
the
count
had
his
own
purposes
when
gave
her
what
van
helsing
called
the
vampire
baptism
blood
well
there
may
poison
that
distils
itself
out
good
things
age
when
the
existence
ptomaines
mystery
should
not
wonder
anything
one
thing
know
that
instinct
true
regarding
poor
mrs
harker
silences
then
there
terrible
difficulty
unknown
danger
the
work
before
the
same
power
that
compels
her
silence
may
compel
her
speech
dare
not
think
further
for
should
thoughts
dishonour
noble
woman
van
helsing
coming
study
little
before
the
others
shall
try
open
the
subject
with
him
later
when
the
professor
came
talked
over
the
state
things
could
see
that
had
something
his
mind
which
wanted
say
but
felt
some
hesitancy
about
broaching
the
subject
after
beating
about
the
bush
little
said
suddenly
friend
john
there
something
that
you
and
must
talk
alone
just
the
first
any
rate
later
may
have
take
the
others
into
our
confidence
then
stopped
waited
went
madam
mina
our
poor
dear
madam
mina
changing
cold
shiver
ran
through
find
worst
fears
thus
endorsed
van
helsing
continued
with
the
sad
experience
miss
lucy
must
this
time
warned
before
things
too
far
our
task
now
reality
more
difficult
than
ever
and
this
new
trouble
makes
every
hour
the
direst
importance
can
see
the
characteristics
the
vampire
coming
her
face
now
but
very
very
slight
but
seen
have
eyes
notice
without
prejudge
her
teeth
are
some
sharper
and
times
her
eyes
are
more
hard
but
these
are
not
all
there
her
the
silence
now
often
was
with
miss
lucy
she
did
not
speak
even
when
she
wrote
that
which
she
wished
known
later
now
fear
this
that
she
can
our
hypnotic
trance
tell
what
the
count
see
and
hear
not
more
true
that
who
have
hypnotise
her
first
and
who
have
drink
her
very
blood
and
make
her
drink
his
should
will
compel
her
mind
disclose
him
that
which
she
know
nodded
acquiescence
went
then
what
must
prevent
this
must
keep
her
ignorant
our
intent
and
she
cannot
tell
what
she
know
not
this
painful
task
painful
that
heart
break
think
but
must
when
day
meet
must
tell
her
that
for
reason
which
will
not
speak
she
must
not
more
our
council
but
simply
guarded
wiped
his
forehead
which
had
broken
out
profuse
perspiration
the
thought
the
pain
which
might
have
inflict
upon
the
poor
soul
already
tortured
knew
that
would
some
sort
comfort
him
told
him
that
also
had
come
the
same
conclusion
for
any
rate
would
take
away
the
pain
doubt
told
him
and
the
effect
was
expected
now
close
the
time
our
general
gathering
van
helsing
has
gone
away
prepare
for
the
meeting
and
his
painful
part
really
believe
his
purpose
able
pray
alone
later
the
very
outset
our
meeting
great
personal
relief
was
experienced
both
van
helsing
and
myself
mrs
harker
had
sent
message
her
husband
say
that
she
would
not
join
present
she
thought
better
that
should
free
discuss
our
movements
without
her
presence
embarrass
the
professor
and
looked
each
other
for
instant
and
somehow
both
seemed
relieved
for
own
part
thought
that
mrs
harker
realised
the
danger
herself
was
much
pain
well
much
danger
averted
under
the
circumstances
agreed
questioning
look
and
answer
with
finger
lip
preserve
silence
our
suspicions
until
should
have
been
able
confer
alone
again
went
once

said
harker
interrogatively
looking
from
one
another
course
answered
the
professor
quickly
you
must
remain
take
care
your
sweet
wife
harker
was
silent
for
awhile
and
then
said
hollow
voice
let
talk
that
part
the
morning
want
consult
with
mina
thought
that
now
was
the
time
for
van
helsing
warn
him
not
disclose
our
plans
her
but
took
notice
looked
him
significantly
and
coughed
for
answer
put
his
finger
his
lips
and
turned
away
jonathan
harker
journal
october
afternoon
for
some
time
after
our
meeting
this
morning
could
not
think
the
new
phases
things
leave
mind
state
wonder
which
allows
room
for
active
thought
mina
determination
not
take
any
part
the
discussion
set
thinking
and
could
not
argue
the
matter
with
her
could
only
guess
far
ever
from
solution
now
the
way
the
others
received
too
puzzled
the
last
time
talked
the
subject
agreed
that
there
was
more
concealment
anything
amongst
mina
sleeping
now
calmly
and
sweetly
like
little
child
her
lips
are
curved
and
her
face
beams
with
happiness
thank
god
there
are
such
moments
still
for
her
later
how
strange
all
sat
watching
mina
happy
sleep
and
came
near
being
happy
myself
suppose
shall
ever
the
evening
drew
and
the
earth
took
its
shadows
from
the
sun
sinking
lower
the
silence
the
room
grew
more
and
more
solemn
all
once
mina
opened
her
eyes
and
looking
tenderly
said
jonathan
want
you
promise
something
your
word
honour
promise
made
but
made
holily
god
hearing
and
not
broken
though
should
down
knees
and
implore
you
with
bitter
tears
quick
you
must
make
once
mina
said
promise
like
that
cannot
make
once
may
have
right
make
but
dear
one
she
said
with
such
spiritual
intensity
that
her
eyes
were
like
pole
stars
who
wish
and
not
for
myself
you
can
ask
van
helsing
not
right
disagrees
you
may
you
will
nay
more
you
all
agree
later
you
are
absolved
from
the
promise
promise
said
and
for
moment
she
looked
supremely
happy
though
all
happiness
for
her
was
denied
the
red
scar
her
forehead
she
said
promise
that
you
will
not
tell
anything
the
plans
formed
for
the
campaign
against
the
count
not
word
inference
implication
not
any
time
whilst
this
remains
and
she
solemnly
pointed
the
scar
saw
that
she
was
earnest
and
said
solemnly
promise
and
said
felt
that
from
that
instant
door
had
been
shut
between
later
midnight
mina
has
been
bright
and
cheerful
all
the
evening
much
that
all
the
rest
seemed
take
courage
infected
somewhat
with
her
gaiety
result
even
myself
felt
the
pall
gloom
which
weighs
down
were
somewhat
lifted
all
retired
early
mina
now
sleeping
like
little
child
wonderful
thing
that
her
faculty
sleep
remains
her
the
midst
her
terrible
trouble
thank
god
for
for
then
least
she
can
forget
her
care
perhaps
her
example
may
affect
her
gaiety
did
night

for
dreamless
sleep
october
morning
another
surprise
mina
woke
early
about
the
same
time
yesterday
and
asked
bring
van
helsing
thought
that
was
another
occasion
for
hypnotism
and
without
question
went
for
the
professor

evidently
expected
some
such
call
for
found
him
dressed
his
room
his
door
was
ajar
that
could
hear
the
opening
the
door

room

once
passed
into
the
room
asked

have
been
paused
embarrassed
she
replied
she
raised
her
finger
and
pointed
her
forehead
know
that
why
must
can
tell
you
now
whilst
the
sun
coming
may
not
able
again

that
when
the
count
wills
must
know
that
tells
come
secret
must
come
wile
any
device

even
jonathan
god
saw
the
look
that
she
turned

spoke
and
there
indeed
recording
angel
that
look
noted
her
everlasting
honour

only
clasp
her
hand

too
great
for
even
the
relief

she
went

brave
and
strong

numbers
for
you
can
defy
that
which
would
break
down
the
human
endurance

who
had
guard

you
can
hypnotise
and
learn
that
which

van

diary
october
evening
jonathan
harker
has
asked
note
this
says
hardly
equal
the
task
and
wants
exact
record
kept
think
that
none
were
surprised
when
were
asked
see
mrs
harker
little
before
the
time
sunset
have
late
come
understand
that
sunrise
and
sunset
are
her
times
peculiar
freedom
when
her
old
self
can
manifest
without
any
controlling
force
subduing
restraining
her
inciting
her
action
this
mood
condition
begins
some
half
hour
more
before
actual
sunrise
sunset
and
lasts
till
either
the
sun
high
whilst
the
clouds
are
still
aglow
with
the
rays
streaming
above
the
horizon
first
there
sort
negative
condition
some
tie
were
loosened
and
then
the
absolute
freedom
quickly
follows
when
however
the
freedom
ceases
the
change
back
relapse
comes
quickly
preceded
only
spell
warning
silence
night
when
met
she
was
somewhat
constrained
and
bore
all
the
signs
internal
struggle
put
down
myself
her
making
violent
effort
the
earliest
instant
she
could
very
few
minutes
however
gave
her
complete
control
herself
then
motioning
her
husband
sit
beside
her
the
sofa
where
she
was
half
reclining
she
made
the
rest
bring
chairs
close
taking
her
husband
hand
hers
began
are
all
here
together
freedom
for
perhaps
the
last
time
know
dear
know
that
you
will
always
with
the
end
this
was
her
husband
whose
hand
had
could
see
tightened
upon
hers
the
morning
out
upon
our
task
and
god
alone
knows
what
may
store
for
any
you
are
going
good
take
with
you
know
that
all
that
brave
earnest
men
can
for
poor
weak
woman
whose
soul
perhaps
lost
not
yet
but
any
rate
stake
you
will
but
you
must
remember
that
not
you
are
there
poison
blood
soul
which
may
destroy
which
must
destroy
unless
some
relief
comes
friends
you
know
well
that
soul
stake
and
though
know
there
one
way
out
for
you
must
not
and
must
not
take
she
looked
appealingly
all
turn
beginning
and
ending
with
her
husband
what
that
way
asked
van
helsing
hoarse
voice
what
that
way
which
must
not
may
not
take
that
may
die
now
either
own
hand
that
another
before
the
greater
evil
entirely
wrought
know
and
you
know
that
were
once
dead
you
could
and
would
set
free
immortal
spirit
even
you
did
poor
lucy
were
death
the
fear
death
the
only
thing
that
stood
the
way
would
not
shrink
die
here
now
amidst
the
friends
who
love
but
death
not
all
cannot
believe
that
die
such
case
when
there
hope
before
and
bitter
task
done
god
will
therefore
part
give
here
the
certainty
eternal
rest
and
out
into
the
dark
where
may
the
blackest
things
that
the
world
the
nether
world
holds
were
all
silent
for
knew
instinctively
that
this
was
only
prelude
the
faces
the
others
were
set
and
harker
grew
ashen
grey
perhaps
guessed
better
than
any
what
was
coming
she
continued
this
what
can
give
into
the
hotch
pot
could
not
but
note
the
quaint
legal
phrase
which
she
used
such
place
and
with
all
seriousness
what
will
each
you
give
your
lives
know
she
went
quickly
that
easy
for
brave
men
your
lives
are
god
and
you
can
give
them
back
him
but
what
will
you
give
she
looked
again
questioningly
but
this
time
avoided
her
husband
face
quincey
seemed
understand
nodded
and
her
face
lit
then
shall
tell
you
plainly
what
want
for
there
must
doubtful
matter
this
connection
between
now
you
must
promise
one
and
all
even
you
beloved
husband
that
should
the
time
come
you
will
kill
what
that
time
the
voice
was
quincey
but
was
low
and
strained
when
you
shall
convinced
that
changed
that
better
that
die
that
may
live
when
thus
dead
the
flesh
then
you
will
without
moment
delay
drive
stake
through
and
cut
off
head
whatever
else
may
wanting
give
rest
quincey
was
the
first
rise
after
the
pause
knelt
down
before
her
and
taking
her
hand
his
said
solemnly
only
rough
fellow
who
hasn
perhaps
lived
man
should
win
such
distinction
but
swear
you
all
that
hold
sacred
and
dear
that
should
the
time
ever
come
shall
not
flinch
from
the
duty
that
you
have
set
and
promise
you
too
that
shall
make
all
certain
for
only
doubtful
shall
take
that
the
time
has
come
true
friend
was
all
she
could
say
amid
her
fast
falling
tears
bending
over
she
kissed
his
hand
swear
the
same
dear
madam
mina
said
van
helsing
and
said
lord
godalming
each
them
turn
kneeling
her
take
the
oath
followed
myself
then
her
husband
turned
her
wan
eyed
and
with
greenish
pallor
which
subdued
the
snowy
whiteness
his
hair
and
asked
and
must
too
make
such
promise
wife
you
too
dearest
she
said
with
infinite
yearning
pity
her
voice
and
eyes
you
must
not
shrink
you
are
nearest
and
dearest
and
all
the
world
our
souls
are
knit
into
one
for
all
life
and
all
time
think
dear
that
there
have
been
times
when
brave
men
have
killed
their
wives
and
their
womenkind
keep
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
the
enemy
their
hands
did
not
falter
any
the
more
because
those
that
they
loved
implored
them
slay
them
men
duty
towards
those
whom
they
love
such
times
sore
trial
and
dear
that
must
meet
death
any
hand
let
the
hand
him
that
loves
best
van
helsing
have
not
forgotten
your
mercy
poor
lucy
case
him
who
loved
she
stopped
with
flying
blush
and
changed
her
phrase
him
who
had
best
right
give
her
peace
that
time
shall
come
again
look
you
make
happy
memory
husband
life
that
was
his
loving
hand
which
set
free
from
the
awful
thrall
upon
again
swear
came
the
professor
resonant
voice
mrs
harker
smiled
positively
smiled
with
sigh
relief
she
leaned
back
and
said
and
now
one
word
warning
warning
which
you
must
never
forget
this
time
ever
come
may
come
quickly
and
unexpectedly
and
such
case
you
must
lose
time
using
your
opportunity
such
time
myself
might
nay
the
time
ever
comes
shall
leagued
with
your
enemy
against
you
one
more
request
she
became
very
solemn
she
said
this
not
vital
and
necessary
like
the
other
but
want
you
one
thing
for
you
will
all
acquiesced
but
one
spoke
there
was
need
speak
want
you
read
the
burial
service
she
was
interrupted
deep
groan
from
her
husband
taking
his
hand
hers
she
held
over
her
heart
and
continued
you
must
read
over
some
day
whatever
may
the
issue
all
this
fearful
state
things
will
sweet
thought
all
some
you
dearest
will
hope
read
for
then
will
your
voice
memory
for
ever
come
what
may
but
dear
one
pleaded
death
afar
off
from
you
nay
she
said
holding
warning
hand
deeper
death
this
moment
than
the
weight
earthly
grave
lay
heavy
upon
wife
must
read
said
before
began
would
comfort
husband
was
all
she
said
and
began
read
when
she
had
got
the
book
ready
how
can
how
could
any
one
tell
that
strange
scene
its
solemnity
its
gloom
its
sadness
its
horror
and
withal
its
sweetness
even
sceptic
who
can
see
nothing
but
travesty
bitter
truth
anything
holy
emotional
would
have
been
melted
the
heart
had
seen
that
little
group
loving
and
devoted
friends
kneeling
round
that
stricken
and
sorrowing
lady
heard
the
tender
passion
her
husband
voice
tones
broken
with
emotion
that
often
had
pause
read
the
simple
and
beautiful
service
from
the
burial
the
dead
cannot
words
and
voice
fail
she
was
right
her
instinct
strange
all
was
bizarre
may
hereafter
seem
even
who
felt
its
potent
influence
the
time
comforted
much
and
the
silence
which
showed
mrs
harker
coming
relapse
from
her
freedom
soul
did
not
seem
full
despair
any
had
dreaded
jonathan

journal
october
varna
left
charing
cross
the
morning
the
got
paris
the
same
night
and
took
the
places
secured
for
the
orient
express
travelled
night
and
day
arriving
here
about
five
clock
lord
godalming
went
the
consulate
see
any
telegram
had
arrived
for
him
whilst
the
rest
came
this
hotel
the
odessus
the
journey
may
have
had
incidents
was
however
too
eager
get
care
for
them
until
the
czarina
catherine
comes
into
port
there
will
interest
for
anything
the
wide
world
thank
god
mina
well
and
looks
getting
stronger
her
colour
coming
back
she
sleeps
great
deal
throughout
the
journey
she
slept
nearly
all
the
time
before
sunrise
and
sunset
however
she
very
wakeful
and
alert
and
has
become
habit
for
van
helsing
hypnotise
her
such
times
first
some
effort
was
needed
and
had
make
many
passes
but
now
she
seems
yield
once
habit
and
scarcely
any
action
needed
seems
have
power
these
particular
moments
simply
will
and
her
thoughts
obey
him
always
asks
her
what
she
can
see
and
hear
she
answers
the
first
nothing
all
dark
and
the
second
can
hear
the
waves
lapping
against
the
ship
and
the
water
rushing
canvas
and
cordage
strain
and
masts
and
yards
creak
the
wind
high
can
hear
the
shrouds
and
the
bow
throws
back
the
foam
evident
that
the
czarina
catherine
still
sea
hastening
her
way
varna
lord
godalming
has
just
returned
had
four
telegrams
one
each
day
since
started
and
all
the
same
effect
that
the
czarina
catherine
had
not
been
reported
lloyd
from
anywhere
had
arranged
before
leaving
london
that
his
agent
should
send
him
every
day
telegram
saying
the
ship
had
been
reported
was
have
message
even
she
were
not
reported
that
might
sure
that
there
was
watch
being
kept
the
other
end
the
wire
had
dinner
and
went
bed
early
morrow
are
see
the
vice
consul
and
arrange
can
about
getting
board
the
ship
soon
she
arrives
van
helsing
says
that
our
chance
will
get
the
boat
between
sunrise
and
sunset
the
count
even
takes
the
form
bat
cannot
cross
the
running
water
his
own
volition
and
cannot
leave
the
ship
dare
not
change
man
form
without
suspicion
which
evidently
wishes
avoid
must
remain
the
box
then
can
come
board
after
sunrise
our
mercy
for
can
open
the
box
and
make
sure
him
did
poor
lucy
before
wakes
what
mercy
shall
get
from
will
not
count
for
much
think
that
shall
not
have
much
trouble
with
officials
the
seamen
thank
god
this
the
country
where
bribery
can
anything
and
are
well
supplied
with
money
have
only
make
sure
that
the
ship
cannot
come
into
port
between
sunset
and
sunrise
without
our
being
warned
and
shall
safe
judge
moneybag
will
settle
this
case
think
october
mina
report
still
the
same
lapping
waves
and
rushing
water
darkness
and
favouring
winds
are
evidently
good
time
and
when
hear
the
czarina
catherine
shall
ready
she
must
pass
the
dardanelles
are
sure
have
some
report
october
everything
pretty
well
fixed
now
think
welcome
the
count
his
return
from
his
tour
godalming
told
the
shippers
that
fancied
that
the
box
sent
aboard
might
contain
something
stolen
from
friend
his
and
got
half
consent
that
might
open
his
own
risk
the
owner
gave
him
paper
telling
the
captain
give
him
every
facility
doing
whatever
chose
board
the
ship
and
also
similar
authorisation
his
agent
varna
have
seen
the
agent
who
was
much
impressed
with
godalming
kindly
manner
him
and
are
all
satisfied
that
whatever
can
aid
our
wishes
will
done
have
already
arranged
what
case
get
the
box
open
the
count
there
van
helsing
and
seward
will
cut
off
his
head
once
and
drive
stake
through
his
heart
morris
and
godalming
and
shall
prevent
interference
even
have
use
the
arms
which
shall
have
ready
the
professor
says
that
can
treat
the
count
body
will
soon
after
fall
into
dust
such
case
there
would
evidence
against
case
any
suspicion
murder
were
aroused
but
even
were
not
should
stand
fall
our
act
and
perhaps
some
day
this
very
script
may
evidence
come
between
some
and
rope
for
myself
should
take
the
chance
only
too
thankfully
were
come
mean
leave
stone
unturned
carry
out
our
intent
have
arranged
with
certain

that
the
instant

often
have
not
however
said
word
the
others
would
break
poor
harker
heart
certainly
his
nerve
knew
that
had
even
suspicion
the
subject
van
helsing
examines
tells
her
teeth
very
carefully
whilst
she
the
hypnotic

says
that
long
they
not

her
this
change
should
come
would
necessary
take
steps
both
know
what
those
steps
would
have
though
not
mention
our
thoughts
each
other
should
neither
shrink
from
the
task
awful
though
contemplate
euthanasia
excellent
and
comforting
word
grateful
whoever
invented
only
about
hours
sail
from
the
dardanelles
here
the
rate
the
czarina
catherine
has
come
from
london
she
should
therefore
arrive
some
time
the
morning
but
she
cannot
possibly
get
before
then
are
all
about
retire
early
shall
get
one
clock
ready
october
noon
news
yet
the
ship
arrival
mrs
harker
hypnotic
report
this
morning
was
the
same
usual
possible
that
may
get
news
any
moment
men
are
all
fever
excitement
except
harker
who
calm
his
hands
are
cold
ice
and
hour
ago
found
him
whetting
the
edge
the
great
ghoorka
knife
which
now
always
carries
with
him
will
bad
lookout
for
the
count
the
edge
that
kukri
ever
touches
his
throat
driven
that
stern
ice
cold
hand
van
helsing
and
were
little
alarmed
about
mrs
harker
day
about
noon
she
got
into
sort
lethargy
which
did
not
like
although
kept
silence
the
others
were
neither
happy
about
she
had
been
restless
all
the
morning
that
were
first
glad
know
that
she
was
sleeping
when
however
her
husband
mentioned
casually
that
she
was
sleeping
soundly
that
could
not
wake
her
went
her
room
see
for
ourselves
she
was
breathing
naturally
and
looked
well
and
peaceful
that
agreed
that
the
sleep
was
better
for
her
than
anything
else
poor
girl
she
has
much
forget
that
wonder
that
sleep
brings
oblivion
her
does
her
good
later
our
opinion
was
justified
for
when
after
refreshing
sleep
some
hours
she
woke
she
seemed
brighter
and
better
than
she
had
been
for
days
sunset
she
made
the
usual
hypnotic
report
wherever
may
the
black
sea
the
count
hurrying
his
destination
his
doom
trust
october
another
day
and
tidings
the
czarina
catherine
she
ought
here
now
that
she
still
journeying
somewhere
apparent
for
mrs
harker
hypnotic
report
sunrise
was
still
the
same
possible
that
the
vessel
may
lying
times
for
fog
some
the
steamers
which
came
last
evening
reported
patches
fog
both
north
and
south
the
port
must
continue
our
watching
the
ship
may
now
signalled
any
moment
october
noon
most
strange
news
yet
the
ship
wait
for
mrs
harker
reported
last
night
and
this
morning
usual
lapping
waves
and
rushing
water
though
she
added
that
the
waves
were
very
faint
the
telegrams
from
london
have
been
the
same
further
report
van
helsing
terribly
anxious
and
told
just
now
that
fears
the
count
escaping
added
significantly
did
not
like
that
lethargy
madam
mina
souls
and
memories
can
strange
things
during
trance
was
about
ask
him
more
but
harker
just
then
came
and
held
warning
hand
must
try
night
sunset
make

speak
more
fully
when

reported
entering
galatz
one
clock
day
seward
diary
october
when
the
telegram
came
announcing
the
arrival
galatz
not
think
was
such
shock
any
might
have
been
expected
true
did
not
know
whence
how
when
the
bolt
would
come
but
think
all
expected
that
something
strange
would
happen
the
delay
arrival
varna
made
individually
satisfied
that
things
would
not
just
had
expected
only
waited
learn
where
the
change
would
occur
none
the
less
however
was
surprise
suppose
that
nature
works
such
hopeful
basis
that
believe
against
ourselves
that
things
will
they
ought
not
should
know
that
they
will
transcendentalism
beacon
the
angels
even
will
the
wisp
man
was
odd
experience
and
all
took
differently
van
helsing
raised
his
hand
over
his
head
for
moment
though
remonstrance
with
the
almighty
but
said
not
word
and
few
seconds
stood
with
his
face
sternly
set
lord
godalming
grew
very
pale
and
sat
breathing
heavily
was
myself
half
stunned
and
looked
wonder
one
after
another
quincey
morris
tightened
his
belt
with
that
quick
movement
which
knew
well
our
old
wandering
days
meant
action
mrs
harker
grew
ghastly
white
that
the
scar
her
forehead
seemed
burn
but
she
folded
her
hands
meekly
and
looked
prayer
harker
smiled
actually
smiled
the
dark
bitter
smile
one
who
without
hope
but
the
same
time
his
action
belied
his
words
for
his
hands
instinctively
sought
the
hilt
the
great
kukri
knife
and
rested
there
when
does
the
next
train
start
for
galatz
said
van
helsing
generally
morrow
morning
all
started
for
the
answer
came
from
mrs

make
our

smooth
that
times
lost
when
over
the
danube
john
will
stay
with
madam
mina
and
and
shall
consult
for
time
long
you

when
the
sun

since
here

brightly
and
more
like
her
old
self
than
she
had
been
for
many
long
day
shall
try
use
all
ways
and
shall
think
and
write
for
you
used
something
shifting
from
some
strange
way
and
feel
freer
than
have
been
late
the
three
younger
men
looked
happier
the
moment
they
seemed
realise
the
significance
her
words
but
van
helsing
and
turning
each
other
met
each
grave
and
troubled
glance
said
nothing
the
time
however
when
the
three
men
had
gone
out
their
tasks
van
helsing
asked
mrs
harker
look
the
copy
the
diaries
and
find
him
the
part

journal
the
castle
she
went
away
get
when
the

was
shut
upon
her
said
mean
the
same
speak
out
there
some
change
hope
that
makes
sick
for
may
deceive
quite
you
know
why
asked
her

the
manuscript

get
opportunity
seeing
alone
you
are
part
right
friend
john
but
only
part
want
tell
you
something
and
friend
taking
great
terrible
risk
but
believe
right
the
moment
when
madam
mina
said
those
words
that
arrest
both
our
understanding
inspiration
came
the
trance
three
days
ago
the
count
sent
her
his
spirit
read
her
mind
more
like
took
her
see
him
his
earth
box
the
ship
with
water
rushing
just
free
rise
and
set
sun
learn
then
that
are
here
for
she
have
more
tell
her
open
life
with

his
coffin
box
now
make
his
most
effort
escape
present
want
her
not
sure
with
his
great
knowledge
that
she
will
come
his
call
but
cut
her
off
take
her
can
out
his
own
power
that
she
come
not

there
have
hope
that
our
man
brains
that
have
been
man
long
and
that
have
not
lost
the
grace
god
will
come
higher
than
his
child
brain
that
lie
his
tomb
for
centuries
that
grow
not
yet
our
stature
and
that
only
work
selfish
and
therefore
small
here
comes
madam
mina
not
word
her
her
trance
she
know
not
and
would
overwhelm
her
and
make
despair
just
when
want
all
her
hope
all
her
courage
when
most
want
all
her
great
brain
which
trained
like
man
brain
but
sweet
woman
and
have
special
power
which
the
count
give
her
and
which
may
not
take
away
altogether
though
think
not
hush
let
speak
and
you
shall
learn
john
friend
are
awful
straits
fear
never
feared
before
can
only
trust
the
good
god
silence
here
she
comes
thought
that
the
professor
was
going
break
down
and
have
hysterics
just
had
when
lucy
died
but
with
great
effort
controlled
himself
and
was
perfect
nervous
poise
when
mrs
harker
tripped
into
the
room
bright
and
happy
looking
and
the
doing
work
seemingly
forgetful
her
misery
she
came
she
handed
number
sheets
typewriting
van
helsing
looked
over
them
gravely
his
face
brightening
read
then
holding
the
pages
between
his
finger
and
thumb
said

when
the
time
come
for
him
try
them
see

here
what
jonathan
have
written
that
other
his
race
who
later
age
again
and
again
brought
his
forces
over
the
great
river
into
turkey
land
who
when
was
beaten
back
came
again
and
again
and
again
though
had
come
alone
from
the
bloody
field
where
his
troops
were
being
slaughtered
since
knew
that
alone
could
ultimately
triumph

there
comes
another
word
from
some
one
who

because
she
too
know
not
what

what
might
mean
just
there
are
elements
which
rest

took
her

and
held
whilst
she
spoke
his

and

closed
her

thought
instinctively
and
unconsciously
she
spoke
the
count

thus
difficulty
has

habit
his
past
clue
and
the
one
page
that
know
and
that
from
his
own
lips
tells
that
once
before
when
what
morris
would
call
tight
place
went
back
his
own
country
from
the
land
had
tried
invade
and
thence
without
losing
purpose
prepared
himself
for
new
effort
came
again
better
equipped
for
his
work
and
won
came
london
invade
new
land
was
beaten
and
when
all
hope
success
was
lost
and
his
existence
danger
fled
back
over
the
sea
his
home
just
formerly
had
fled
back
over
the
danube
from
turkey
land
good
good
you
clever
lady
said
van
helsing
enthusiastically
stooped
and
kissed
her
hand
moment
later
said
calmly
though
had
been
having
sick
room
consultation
seventy
two
only
and
all
this
excitement
have
hope
turning
her
again
said
with
keen
expectation
but
there
more
tell
you
will
not
afraid
john
and
know
any
case
and
shall
tell
you
you
are
right
speak
without
fear
will
try
but
you
will
forgive
seem
egotistical
nay
fear
not
you
must
egotist
for
you
that
think
then
criminal
selfish
and
his
intellect
small
and
his
action
based
selfishness
confines
himself
one
purpose
that
purpose
remorseless
fled
back
over
the
danube
leaving
his
forces
cut
pieces
now
intent
being
safe
careless
all
his
own
selfishness
frees
soul
somewhat
from
the
terrible
power
which
acquired
over
that
dreadful
night
felt
felt
thank
god
for
his
great
mercy
soul
freer
than
has
been
since
that
awful
hour
and
all
that
haunts
fear
lest
some
trance
dream
may
have
used
knowledge
for
his
ends
the
professor
stood
has
used
your
mind
and
has
left
here
varna
whilst
the
ship
that
carried
him
rushed
through
enveloping
fog
galatz
where
doubtless
had
made
preparation
for
escaping
from
but
his
child
mind
only
saw
far
and
may
that
ever
god
providence
the
very
thing
that
the
evil
doer
most
reckoned
for
his
selfish
good
turns
out
his
chiefest
harm
the
hunter
taken
his
own
snare
the
great
psalmist
says
for
now
that
think
free
from
every
trace
all
and
that
has
escaped
with
many
hours
him
then
his
selfish
child
brain
will
whisper
him
sleep
think
too
that
cut
himself
off
from
knowing
your
mind
there
can
knowledge
him
you
there
where
fail
that
terrible
baptism
blood
which
give
you
makes
you
free

you
have
yet
done
your
times
freedom
when
the
sun
rise
and
set
such
times
you
volition
and
not
his
and
this
power
good
you
and
others
you
have
won
from
your
suffering
his
hands
this
now
all
the
more
precious
that
know
not
and
guard
himself
have
even
cut
himself
off
from
his
knowledge
our
where
however
are
not
selfish
and
believe
that
god
with
through
all
this
blackness
and
these
many
dark
hours
shall
fellow
him
and
shall
not
flinch
even
peril
ourselves
that
become
like
him
friend
john
this
has
been
great
hour
and
have
done
much
advance
our
way
you
must
scribe
and
write
him
all
down
that
when
the
others
return
from
their
work
you
can
give
them
then
they
shall
know
and
have
written
whilst
wait
their
return
and
mrs

has
written
with
her
typewriter
all
since
she
brought

when
the
usual
time
came
round
mrs
harker
prepared
herself
for
her
hypnotic
effort
and
after
longer
and
more
serious
effort
the
part
van
helsing
than
has
been
usually
necessary
she
sank
into
the
trance
usually
she
speaks
hint
but
this
time
the
professor
had
ask
her
questions
and
ask
them
pretty
resolutely
before
could
learn
anything
last
her
answer
came
can
see
nothing
are
still
there
are
waves
lapping
but
only
steady
swirl
water
softly
running
against
the
hawser
can
hear
men
voices
calling
near
and

she
stopped
she
had
risen
impulsively
from
where
she
lay
the

and
raised
both
her
hands
palms
upwards
lifting
weight
van
helsing
and
looked
each
other
with
understanding
quincey
raised
his
eyebrows
slightly
and
looked
her
intently
whilst
harker
hand
instinctively
closed
round
the
hilt
his
kukri
there
was
long
pause
all
knew
that
the
time
when
she
could
speak
was
passing
but
felt
that
was
useless
say
anything
suddenly
she
sat
and
she
opened
her
eyes
said
sweetly
would
none
you
like
cup
tea
you
must
all
tired
could
only
make
her
happy
and
acquiesced
she
bustled
off
get
tea
when
she
had
gone
van

said
you

yet
get
shore
the
night
may
lie
hidden
somewhere
but
not
carried
shore
the

not
touch
cannot
achieve
the
land
such
case
can
the
night
change
his
form
and
can
jump
fly
shore
did
whitby
but
the
day
come
before
get
shore
then
unless
carried
cannot
escape
and
carried
then
the

may
discover
what
the

contain
thus
fine
escape
not

night
before

there
will
the
whole

lost
him
may
then
arrive

for

not

shall
come
him
daytime
boxed
and
our
mercy
for
dare
not
his
true
self
awake
and
visible
lest
discovered
there
was
more
said
waited
patience
until
the
dawn
which
time
might
learn
more
from
mrs
harker
early
this
morning
listened
with
breathless
anxiety
for
her
response
her
trance
the
hypnotic
stage
was
even
longer
coming
than
before
and
when
came
the
time
remaining
until
full
sunrise
was
short
that
began
despair
van
helsing
seemed
throw
his
whole
soul
into
the
effort
last
obedience
his
will
she
made
reply
all
dark
hear
lapping
water
level
with
and
some
creaking
wood
wood
she
paused
and
the
red
sun
shot
must
wait
till
night
and
that
are
travelling
towards
galatz
agony
expectation
are
due
arrive
between
two
and
three
the
morning
but
already
bucharest
are
three
hours
late
cannot
possibly
get
till
well
after
sun
thus
shall
have
two
more
hypnotic
messages
from
mrs
harker
either
both
may
possibly
throw
more
light
what
happening
later
sunset
has
come
and
gone
fortunately
came
time
when
there
was
distraction
for
had
occurred
whilst
were
station
might
not
have
secured
the
necessary
calm
and
isolation
mrs
harker
yielded
the
hypnotic
influence
even
less
readily
than
this
morning
fear
that
her
power
reading
the
count
sensations
may
die
away
just
when
want
most
seems
that
her
imagination
beginning
work
whilst
she
has
been
the
trance
hitherto
she
has
confined
herself
the
simplest
facts
this
goes
may
ultimately
mislead
thought
that
the
count
power
over
her
would
die
away
equally
with
her
power
knowledge
would
happy
thought
but
afraid
that
may
not
when
she
did
speak
her
words
were
enigmatical
something
going
out
can
feel
pass
like
cold
wind
can
hear
far
off
confused
sounds
men
talking
strange
tongues
fierce
falling
water
and
the
howling
wolves
she
stopped
and
shudder
ran
through
her
increasing
intensity
for
few
seconds
till
the
end
she
shook
though
palsy
she
said
more
even
answer
the
professor
imperative
questioning
when
she
woke
from
the
trance
she
was
cold
and
exhausted
and
languid
but
her
mind
was
all
alert
she
could
not
remember
anything
but
asked
what
she
had
said
when
she
was
told
she
pondered
over
deeply
for
long
time
and
silence

sunrise
this

began
his
passes
earlier
than
usual
they
produced

however
until
the
regular
time
when
she
yielded
with
still
greater
difficulty
only
minute
before
the
sun
rose
the
professor
lost
time
his
questioning
her
answer
came
with
equal
quickness
all
dark
hear
water
swirling
level
with
ears
and
the
creaking

low
far
off
there
another

like
she
stopped
and
grew
white
and
whiter

voice
the
same
time
there
was
despair
his
eyes
for
the
risen
sun
was
reddening
even
mrs
harker
pale
face
she
opened
her
eyes
and
all
started
she
said
sweetly
and
seemingly
with
the
utmost
unconcern
professor
why
ask
what
you
know
can
don
remember
anything
then
seeing
the
look

said
turning
from

the
other
with
troubled
look
what

that

his

united
with

played
the

for

the

jonathan
interrupted
him
hotly
you
mean
say
professor
van

that
you
would
bring

her
sad
case
and
tainted
she
with
that
devil
illness
right
into

his
death
trap
not
for

not
for

hell
became
almost
speechless
for
minute
and
then
went
you
know
what
the
place
have
you
seen
that
awful
den
hellish
infamy
with
the
very
moonlight
alive
with
grisly
shapes
and
every
speck
dust
that
whirls
the
wind
devouring
monster
embryo
have
you
felt
the
vampire
lips
upon
your
throat
here
turned
and
his
eyes
lit
forehead
threw
his
arms
with
cry
god
what
have
done
have
this
terror
upon
and
sank
down
the
sofa
collapse
misery
the
professor
voice
spoke
clear
sweet
tones
which
seemed
vibrate
the
air
calmed
all
friend
because
would
save
madam
mina
from
that
awful
place
that
would
god
forbid
that
should
take
her
into
that
place
there
work
wild
work
done
there
that
her
eyes
may
not
see
men
here
all
save
jonathan
have
seen
with
their
own
eyes
what
done
before
that
place

remember
that
are
terrible
straits
the

escape
this
time
and
strong
and
subtle
and
cunning
may
choose
sleep
him
for
century
and
then
time
our
dear
one
took
hand
would
come
him
keep
him
company
and
would
those
others
that
you
jonathan
saw
you
have
told
their
gloating
lips
you
heard
their
ribald
laugh
they
clutched
the
moving
bag
that
the
count
threw
them
you
shudder
and
well
may
forgive
that
make
you
much
pain
but
necessary
friend
not
dire

for
the
which
giving
possibly

said
jonathan
with

that

him
all
over

later
did
good
see
the
way
that
these
brave
men
worked
how
can

help
loving

when
they
are

true

brave
and
too
made
think

the

doing
their

wonder
how
seward

endless

running
down
the

none
them
are

all

though
they
are

doubtless
winter
and
when

melts
the

obstruction
hope
that

all
yesterday
travel
ever
getting
closer
the
mountains
and
moving
into
more
and
more
wild
and
desert
land
there
are
great
frowning
precipices
and
much
falling
water
and
nature
seem
have
held
sometime
her
carnival
madam
mina
still
sleep
and
sleep
and
though
did
have
hunger
and
appeased
could
not
waken
her
even
for
food
began
fear
that
the
fatal
spell
the
place
was
upon
her
tainted
she
with
that
vampire
baptism
well
said
myself
that
she
sleep
all
the
day
shall
also
that
not

night
travel
the
rough
road
for
road
ancient
and
imperfect
kind
there
was
held
down
head
and
slept
again
waked
with
sense
guilt
and
time
passed
and
found
madam
mina
still
sleeping
and
the
sun
low
down
but
all
was
indeed
changed
the
frowning
mountains
seemed
further
away
and
were
near
the
top
steep
rising
hill
summit
which
was
such
castle
jonathan
tell
his
diary
once
exulted
and
feared
for
now
for
good
ill
the
end
was
near
woke
madam
mina
and
again
tried
hypnotise
her
but
alas
unavailing
till
too
late
then
ere
the
great
dark
came
upon
for
even
after
down
sun
the
heavens
reflected
the
gone
sun
the
snow
and
all
was
for
time
great
twilight
took
out
the
horses
and
fed
them
what
shelter
could
then
make
fire
and
near
make
madam
mina
now
awake
and
more
charming
than
ever
sit
comfortable
amid
her
rugs
got
ready
food
but
she
would
not
eat
simply
saying
that
she
had
not
hunger
did
not
press
her
knowing
her
unavailingness
but
myself
eat
for
must
needs
now
strong
for
all
then
with
the
fear
what
might
drew
ring
big
for
her
comfort
round
where
madam
mina
sat
and
over
the
ring
passed
some
the
wafer
and
broke
fine
that
all
was
well
guarded
she
sat
still
all
the
time
still
one
dead
and
she
grew
whiter
and
ever
whiter
till
the
snow
was
not
more
pale
and
word
she
said
but
when
drew
near
she
clung
and
could
know
that
the
poor
soul
shook
her
from
head
feet
with
tremor
that
was
pain
feel
said
her
presently
when
she
had
grown
more
quiet
will
you
not
come
over
the
fire
for
wished
make
test
what
she
could
she
rose
obedient
but
when
she
have
made
step
she
stopped
and
stood
one
stricken
why
not
asked
she
shook
her
head
and
coming
back
sat
down
her
place
then
looking
with
open
eyes
one
waked
from
sleep
she
said
simply
cannot
and
remained
silent
rejoiced
for
knew
that
what
she
could
not
none
those
that
dreaded
could
though
there
might
danger
her
body
yet
her
soul
was
safe
presently
the
horses
began
scream
and
tore
their
tethers
till
came
them
and
quieted
them
when
they
did
feel
hands
them
they
whinnied
low
joy
and
licked
hands
and
were
quiet
for
time
many
times
through
the
night
did
come
them
till
arrive
the
cold
hour
when
all
nature
lowest
and
every
time
coming
was
with
quiet
them
the
cold
hour
the
fire
began
die
and
was
about
stepping
forth
replenish
for
now
the
snow
came
flying
sweeps
and
with
chill
mist
even
the
dark
there
was
light
some
kind
there
ever
over
snow
and
seemed
though
the
snow
flurries
and
the
wreaths
mist
took
shape
women
with
trailing
garments
all
was
dead
grim
silence
only
that
the
horses
whinnied
and
cowered
terror
the
worst
began
fear
horrible
fears
but
then
came
the
sense
safety
that
ring
wherein
stood
began
too
think
that
imaginings
were
the
night
and
the
gloom
and
the
unrest
that
have
gone
through
and
all
the
terrible
anxiety
was
though
memories
all
jonathan
horrid
experience
were
befooling
for
the
snow
flakes
and
the
mist
began
wheel
and
circle
round
till
could
get
though
shadowy
glimpse
those
women
that
would
have
kissed
him
and
then
the
horses
cowered
lower
and
lower
and
moaned
terror
men
pain
even
the
madness
fright
was
not
them
that
they
could
break
away
feared
for
dear
madam
mina
when
these
weird
figures
drew
near
and
circled
round
looked
her
but
she
sat
calm
and
smiled
when
would
have
stepped
the
fire
replenish
she
caught
and
held
back
and
whispered
like
voice
that
one
hears
dream
low
was
not
without
here
you
are
safe
turned
her
and
looking
her
eyes
said
but
you
for
you
that
fear
whereat
she
laughed
laugh
low
and
unreal
and
said
fear
for
why
fear
for
none
safer
all
the
world
from
them
than
and
wondered
the
meaning
her
words
puff
wind
made
the
flame
leap
and
see
the
red
scar
her
forehead
then
alas
knew
did
not
would
soon
have
learned
for
the
wheeling
figures
mist
and
snow
came
closer
but
keeping
ever
without
the
holy
circle
then
they
began
materialise
till
god
have
not
take
away
reason
for
saw
through
eyes
there
were
before
actual
flesh
the
same
three
women
that
jonathan
saw
the
room
when
they
would
have
kissed
his
throat
knew
the
swaying
round
forms
the
bright
hard
eyes
the
white
teeth
the
ruddy
colour
the
voluptuous
lips
they
smiled
ever
poor
dear
madam
mina
and
their
laugh
came
through
the
silence
the
night
they
twined
their
arms
and
pointed
her
and
said
those
sweet
tingling
tones
that
jonathan
said
were
the
intolerable
sweetness
the
water
glasses
come
sister
come
come
come
fear
turned
poor
madam
mina
and
heart
with
gladness
leapt
like
flame
for
the
terror
her
sweet
eyes
the
repulsion
the
horror
told
story
heart
that
was
all
hope
god
thanked
she
was
not
yet
them
seized
some
the
firewood
which
was
and
holding
out
some
the
wafer
advanced
them
towards
the
fire
they
drew
back
before
and
laughed
their
low
horrid
laugh
fed
the
fire
and
feared
them
not
for
knew
that
were
safe
within
our
protections
they
could
not
approach
whilst
armed
nor
madam
mina
whilst
she
remained
within
the
ring
which
she
could
not
leave
more
than
they
could
enter
the
horses
had
ceased
moan
and
lay
still
the
ground
the
snow
fell
them
softly
and
they
grew
whiter
knew
that
there
was
for
the
poor
beasts
more
terror
and
remained
till
the
red
the
dawn
fall
through
the
snow
gloom
was
desolate
and
afraid
and
full
woe
and
terror
but
when
that
beautiful
sun
began
climb
the
horizon
life
was
again
the
first
coming
the
dawn
the
horrid
figures
melted
the
whirling

and

the
wreaths

moved
away
towards
the

and
were
lost
instinctively
with
the
dawn

madam

intending
hypnotise
her
but
she
lay
deep
and
sudden
sleep
from
which
could

through
her
sleep
but
she
made

memory
his
diary
found
way
the
old
chapel
for
knew
that
here
work
lay
the
air
was
oppressive
seemed
there
was
some
sulphurous
fume
which
times
made
dizzy

terrible
plight
the

had
between
his
horns
her
had
not
dare
take
into
this
place
but
left
safe
from
the
vampire
that
holy
circle
and
yet
even
there
would
the
wolf
resolve
that
work
lay
here
and
that
the
wolves
must
submit
were
god

any

make

sleep
full
life
and
voluptuous
beauty
that
shudder
though
have
come
murder
doubt
not
that
old
time
when
such

were
many
man
who
set
forth
such
task
mine
found
the
last
his

fail
him

then
his

delay
and
delay
and
delay
till
the
mere
beauty
and
the
fascination
the
wanton
dead
have
hypnotise
him
and
remain
and
till
sunset
come
and
the
vampire
sleep
over
then
the
beautiful
eyes
the
fair
woman
open
and
look
love
and
the
voluptuous
mouth
present
kiss
and
man
weak
and
there
remain
one
more
victim
the
vampire
fold
one
more
swell
the
grim
and
grisly
ranks
the

there
some
fascination
surely
when
moved
the

such
one
even
lying
she
lay

fretted
with
age
and
heavy
with
the

there
that
horrid

with
all

and
with
motive
for

yearning
for
delay
which
seemed
paralyse
faculties
and
clog
very
soul
may
have
been
that
the
need
natural
sleep
and
the
strange
oppression
the
air
were
beginning
overcome
certain
was
that
was
lapsing
into
sleep
the
open
eyed
sleep
one
who
yields
sweet
fascination
when
there
came
through
the
snow
stilled
air
long
low
wail
full
woe
and
pity
that
woke
like
the
sound
clarion
for
was
the
voice
dear
madam

that
heard
then
braced
myself
again

found
wrenching

dared
not
pause
look

her

searching
until
presently
find

like
jonathan

gather
herself
out

was
fair

radiantly
beautiful
exquisitely
voluptuous
that
the
very
instinct

which
calls

whirl
with
new
emotion

god
thanked
that

before

this

searched
all
the

and
there
had
been
only
three
these

phantoms
around
the
night
took
that
there
were
more

there
was
one
great

more

november
was
late
the
afternoon
when
the
professor
and
took
our
way
towards
the
east
whence
knew
jonathan
was
coming
did
not
fast
though
the
way
was
steeply
downhill
for
had
take
heavy
rugs
and
wraps
with
dared
not
face
the
possibility
being
left
without
warmth
the
cold
and
the
snow
had
take
some
our
provisions
too
for
were
perfect
desolation
and
far
could
see
through
the
snowfall
there
was
not
even
the
sign
habitation
when
had
gone
about
mile
was
tired
with
the
heavy
walking
and
sat
down
rest
then
looked
back
and
saw
where
the
clear
line
dracula
castle
cut
the
sky
for
were
deep
under
the
hill
whereon
was
set
that
the
angle
perspective
the
carpathian
mountains
was
far
below
saw
all
its
grandeur
perched
thousand
feet
the
summit
sheer
precipice
and
with
seemingly
great
gap
between
and
the
steep
the
adjacent
mountain
any
side
there
was
something
wild
and
uncanny
about
the
place
could
hear
the
distant
howling
wolves
they
were
far
off
but
the
sound
even
though
coming
muffled
through
the
deadening
snowfall
was
full
terror
knew
from
the
way
van
helsing
was
searching
about
that
was
trying
seek
some
strategic
point
where
would
less
exposed
case
attack
the
rough
roadway
still
led
downwards
could
trace
through
the
drifted
snow
little
while
the
professor
signalled
got
and
joined
him
had
found
wonderful
spot
sort
natural
hollow
rock
with
entrance
like
doorway
between
two
boulders
took
the
hand
and
drew
see
said
here
you
will
shelter
and
the
wolves
come
can
meet
them
one
one
brought
our
furs
and
made
snug
nest
for
and
got
out
some
provisions
and
forced
them
upon
but
could
not
eat
even
try
was
repulsive
and
much
would
have
liked
please
him
could
not
bring
myself
the
attempt
looked
very
sad
but
did
not
reproach
taking
his
field
glasses
from
the
case
stood
the
top
the
rock
and
began
search
the
horizon
suddenly
called
out
look
madam
mina
look
look
sprang
and
stood
beside
him
the
rock
handed
his
glasses
and
pointed
the
snow
was
now
falling
more
heavily
and
swirled
about
fiercely
for
high
wind
was
beginning
blow
however
there
were
times
when
there
were
pauses
between
the
snow
flurries
and
could
see
long
way
round
from
the
height
where
were
was
possible
see
great
distance
and
far
off
beyond
the
white
waste
snow
could
see
the
river
lying
like
black
ribbon
kinks
and
curls
wound
its
way
straight
front
and
not
far
off
fact
near
that
wondered
had
not
noticed
before
came
group
mounted
men
hurrying
along
the
midst
them
was
cart
long
leiter
wagon
which
swept
from
side
side
like
dog
tail
wagging
with
each
stern
inequality
the
road
outlined
against
the
snow
they
were
could
see
from
the
men
clothes
that
they
were
peasants
gypsies
some
kind
the
cart
was
great
square
chest
heart
leaped
saw
for
felt
that
the
end
was
coming
the
evening
was
now
drawing
close
and
well
knew
that
sunset
the
thing
which
was
till
then
imprisoned
there
would
take
new
freedom
and
could
any
many
forms
elude
all
pursuit
fear
turned
the
professor
consternation
however
was
not
there
instant
later
saw
him
below
round
the
rock
had
drawn
circle
such
had
found
shelter
last
night
when
had
completed
stood
beside
again
saying
least
you
shall
safe
here
from
him
took
the
glasses
from
and
the
next
lull
the
snow
swept
the
whole
space
below
see
said
they
come
quickly
they
are
flogging
the
horses
and
galloping
hard
they
can
paused
and
went
hollow
voice
they
are
racing
for
the
sunset
may
too
late
god
will
done
down
came
another
blinding
rush
driving
snow
and
the
whole
landscape
was
blotted
out
soon
passed
however
and
once
more
his
glasses
were
fixed
the
plain
then
came
sudden
cry
look
look
look
see
two
horsemen
follow
fast
coming
from
the
south
must
quincey
and
john
take
the
glass
look
before
the
snow
blots
all
out
took
and
looked
the
two
men
might
seward
and
morris
knew
all
events
that
neither
them
was
jonathan
the
same
time
knew
that
jonathan
was
not
far
off
looking
around
saw
the
north
side
the
coming
party
two
other
men
riding
break
neck
speed
one
them
knew
was
jonathan
and
the
other
took
course
lord
godalming
they
too
were
pursuing
the
party
with
the
cart
when
told
the
professor
shouted
glee
like
schoolboy
and
after
looking
intently
till
snow
fall
made
sight
impossible
laid
his
winchester
rifle
ready
for
use
against
the
boulder
the
opening
our
shelter
they
are
all
converging
said
when
the
time
comes
shall
have
gypsies
all
sides
got
out
revolver
ready
hand
for
whilst
were
speaking
the
howling
wolves
came
louder
and
closer
when
the
snow
storm
abated
moment
looked
again
was
strange
see
the
snow
falling
such
heavy
flakes
close
and
beyond
the
sun
shining
more
and
more
brightly
sank
down
towards
the
far
mountain
tops
sweeping
the
glass
all
around
could
see
here
and
there
dots
moving
singly
and
twos
and
threes
and
larger
numbers
the
wolves
were
gathering
for
their
prey
every
instant
seemed
age
whilst
waited
the
wind
came
now
fierce
bursts
and
the
snow
was
driven
with
fury
swept
upon
circling
eddies
times
could
not
see
arm
length
before
but
others
the
hollow
sounding
wind
swept
seemed
clear
the
air
space
around
that
could
see
afar
off
had
late
been
accustomed
watch
for
sunrise
and
sunset
that
knew
with
fair
accuracy
when
would
and
knew
that
before
long
the
sun
would
set
was
hard
believe
that
our
watches
was
less
than
hour
that
waited
that
rocky
shelter
before
the
various
bodies
began
converge
close
upon
the
wind
came
now
with
fiercer
and
more
bitter
sweeps
and
more
steadily
from
the
north
seemingly
had
driven
the
snow
clouds
from
for
with
only
occasional
bursts
the
snow
fell
could
distinguish
clearly
the
individuals
each
party
the
pursued
and
the
pursuers
strangely
enough
those
pursued
did
not
seem
realise
least
care
that
they
were
pursued
they
seemed
however
hasten
with
redoubled
speed
the
sun
dropped
lower
and
lower
the
mountain
tops
closer
and
closer
they
drew
the
professor
and
crouched
down
behind
our
rock
and
held
our
weapons
ready
could
see
that
was
determined
that
they
should
not
pass
one
and
all
were
quite
unaware
our
presence
all
once
two
voices
shouted
out
halt
one
was
jonathan
raised
high
key
passion
the
other
morris
strong
resolute
tone
quiet
command
the
gypsies
may
not
have
known
the
language
but
there
was
mistaking
the
tone
whatever
tongue
the
words
were
spoken
instinctively
they
reined
and
the
instant
lord
godalming
and
jonathan
dashed
one
side
and
seward
and
morris
the
other
the
leader
the
gypsies
splendid
looking
fellow
who
sat
his
horse
like
centaur
waved
them
back
and
fierce
voice
gave
his
companions
some
word
proceed
they
lashed
the
horses
which
sprang
forward
but
the
four
men
raised
their
winchester
rifles
and
unmistakable
way
commanded
them
stop
the
same
moment
van
helsing
and
rose
behind
the
rock
and
pointed
our
weapons
them
seeing
that
they
were
surrounded
the
men
tightened
their
reins
and
drew
the
leader
turned
them
and
gave
word
which
every
man
the
gypsy
party
drew
what
weapon
carried
knife
pistol
and
held
himself
readiness
attack
issue
was
joined
instant
the
leader
with
quick
movement
his
rein
threw
his
horse
out
front
and
pointing
first
the
sun
now
close
down
the
hill
tops
and
then
the
castle
said
something
which
did
not
understand
for
answer
all
four
men
our
party
threw
themselves
from
their
horses
and
dashed
towards
the
cart
should
have
felt
terrible
fear
seeing
jonathan
such
danger
but
that
the
ardour
battle
must
have
been
upon
well
the
rest
them
felt
fear
but
only
wild
surging
desire
something
seeing
the
quick
movement
our
parties
the
leader
the
gypsies
gave
command
his
men
instantly
formed
round
the
cart
sort
undisciplined
endeavour
each
one
shouldering
and
pushing
the
other
his
eagerness
carry
out
the
order
the
midst
this
could
see
that
jonathan
one
side
the
ring
men
and
quincey
the
other
were
forcing
way
the
cart
was
evident
that
they
were
bent
finishing
their
task
before
the
sun
should
set
nothing
seemed
stop
even
hinder
them
neither
the
levelled
weapons
nor
the
flashing
knives
the
gypsies
front
nor
the
howling
the
wolves
behind
appeared
even
attract
their
attention
jonathan
impetuosity
and
the
manifest
singleness
his
purpose
seemed
overawe
those
front
him
instinctively
they
cowered
aside
and
let
him
pass
instant
had
jumped
upon
the
cart
and
with
strength
which
seemed
incredible
raised
the
great
box
and
flung
over
the
wheel
the
ground
the
meantime
morris
had
had
use
force
pass
through
his
side
the
ring
szgany
all
the
time
had
been
breathlessly
watching
jonathan
had
with
the
tail
eye
seen
him
pressing
desperately
forward
and
had
seen
the
knives
the
gypsies
flash
won
way
through
them
and
they
cut
him
had
parried
with
his
great
bowie
knife
and
first
thought
that
too
had
come
through
safety
but
sprang
beside
jonathan
who
had
now
jumped
from
the
cart
could
see
that
with
his
left
hand
was
clutching
his
side
and
that
the
blood
was
spurting
through
his
fingers
did
not
delay
notwithstanding
this
for
jonathan
with
desperate
energy
attacked
one
end
the
chest
attempting
prize
off
the
lid
with
his
great
kukri
knife
attacked
the
other
frantically
with
his
bowie
under
the
efforts
both
men
the
lid
began
yield
the
nails
drew
with
quick
screeching
sound
and
the
top
the
box
was
thrown
back
this
time
the
gypsies
seeing
themselves
covered
the
winchesters
and
the
mercy
lord
godalming
and
seward
had
given
and
made
resistance
the
sun
was
almost
down
the
mountain
tops
and
the
shadows
the
whole
group
fell
long
upon
the
snow
saw
the
count
lying
within
the
box
upon
the
earth
some
which
the
rude
falling
from
the
cart
had
scattered
over
him
was
deathly
pale
just
like
waxen
image
and
the
red
eyes
glared
with
the
horrible
vindictive
look
which
knew
too
well
looked
the
eyes
saw
the
sinking
sun
and
the
look
hate
them
turned
triumph
but
the
instant
came
the
sweep
and
flash
jonathan
great
knife
shrieked
saw
shear
through
the
throat
whilst
the
same
moment
morris
bowie
knife
plunged
into
the
heart
was
like
miracle
but
before
our
very
eyes
and
almost
the
drawing
breath
the
whole
body
crumble
into
dust
and
passed
from
our
sight
shall
glad
long
live
that
even
that
moment
final
dissolution
there
was
the
face
look
peace
such
never
could
have
imagined
might
have
rested
there
the
castle
dracula
now
stood
out
against
the
red
sky
and
every
stone
its
broken
battlements
was
articulated
against
the
light
the
setting
sun
the
gypsies
taking
some
way
the
cause
the
extraordinary
disappearance
the
dead
man
turned
without
word
and
rode
away
for
their
lives
those
who
were
unmounted
jumped
upon
the
leiter
wagon
and
shouted
the
horsemen
not
desert
them
the
wolves
which
had
withdrawn
safe
distance
followed
their
wake
leaving
alone
morris
who
had
sunk
the
ground
leaned
his
elbow
holding
his
hand
pressed
his
side
the
blood
still
gushed
through
his
fingers
flew
him
for
the
holy
circle
did
not
now
keep
back
did
the
two
doctors
jonathan
knelt
behind
him
and
the
wounded
man
laid
back
his
head
his
shoulder
with
sigh
took
with
feeble
effort
hand
that
his
own
which
was
unstained
must
have
seen
the
anguish
heart
face
for
smiled
and
said
only
too
happy
have
been
any
service
god
cried
suddenly
struggling
sitting
posture
and
pointing
was
worth
for
this
die
look
look
the
sun
was
now
right
down
upon
the
mountain
top
and
the
red
gleams
fell
upon
face
that
was
bathed
rosy
light
with
one
impulse
the
men
sank
their
knees
and
deep
and
earnest
amen
broke
from
all
their
eyes
followed
the
pointing
his
finger
the
dying
man
spoke
now
god
thanked
that
all
has
not
been
vain
see
the
snow
not
more
stainless
than
her
forehead
the
curse
has
passed
away
and
our
bitter
grief
with
smile
and
silence
died
gallant
gentleman
note
seven
years
ago
all
went
through
the
flames
and
the
happiness
some
since
then
think
well
worth
the
pain
endured
added
joy
mina
and
that
our
boy
birthday
the
same
day
that
which
quincey
morris
died
his
mother
holds
know
the
secret
belief
that
some
our
brave
friend
spirit
has
passed
into
him
his
bundle
names
links
all
our
little
band
men
together
but
call
him
quincey
the
summer
this
year
made
journey
transylvania
and
went
over
the
old
ground
which
was
and
full
vivid
and
terrible
memories
was
almost
impossible
believe
that
the
things
which
had
seen
with
our
own
eyes
and
heard
with
our
own
ears
were
living
truths
every
trace
all
that
had
been
was
blotted
out
the
castle
stood
before
reared
high
above
waste
desolation
when
got
home
were
talking
the
old
time
which
could
all
look
back
without
despair
for
godalming
and
seward
are
both
happily
married
took
the
papers
from
the
safe
where
they
had
been
ever
since
our
return
long
ago
were
struck
with
the
fact
that
all
the
mass
material
which
the
record
composed
there
hardly
one
authentic
document
nothing
but
mass
typewriting
except
the
later
note
books
mina
and
seward
and
myself
and
van
helsing
memorandum
could
hardly
ask
any
one
even
did
wish
accept
these
proofs
wild
story
van
helsing
summed
all
said
with
our
boy
his
knee
want
proofs
ask
none
believe
this
boy
will
some
day
know
what
brave
and
gallant
woman
his
mother
already
knows
her
sweetness
and
loving
care
later
will
understand
how
some
men
loved
her
that
they
